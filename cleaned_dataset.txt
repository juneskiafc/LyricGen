I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid (yeah) <eos> To take a stand, it's been a ride <eos> Everybody, I guess I had to <eos> Go to that place <eos> To get to this one <eos> Now some of you <eos> Might still be in that place <eos> If you're tryin' to get out <eos> Just follow me <eos> I'll get you there <eos> You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em <eos> But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em <eos> 'Cause ain't no way I'm a let you stop me from causin' mayhem <eos> When I say I'm a do somethin' I do it <eos> I don't give a damn what you think <eos> I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans <eos> It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me <eos> I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly <eos> And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony <eos> No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he <eos> From "Infinite" down to the last "Relapse" album he's still shittin' <eos> Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him <eos> Whichever comes first, for better or worse <eos> He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas <eos> His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt <eos> And fuck the whole universe <eos> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) <eos> To take a stand (to take a stand) <eos> Everybody (everybody) <eos> Come take my hand come (come take my hand) <eos> We'll walk this road together, through the storm <eos> Whatever weather, cold or warm <eos> Just letting you know that, you're not alone <eos> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road <eos> Okay quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap <eos> I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap <eos> You said you was king <eos> You lied through your teeth, for that fuck your feelings <eos> Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans <eos> I'll never let you down again, I'm back <eos> I promise to never go back on that promise <eos> In fact, let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was eh <eos> Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground <eos> Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now <eos> All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack, blow 'cause I ain't playin' around <eos> It's a game called circle and I don't know how <eos> I'm way too up to back down <eos> But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out <eos> Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud <eos> Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons <eos> These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now <eos> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) <eos> To take a stand (to take a stand) <eos> Everybody (everybody) <eos> Come take my hand come (come take my hand) <eos> We'll walk this road together, through the storm <eos> Whatever weather, cold or warm <eos> Just letting you know that, you're not alone <eos> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road <eos> And I just can't keep living this way <eos> So starting today <eos> I'm breaking out of this cage <eos> I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons <eos> I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground <eos> I've had enough, now I'm so fed up <eos> Time to put my life back together right now (now) <eos> It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me <eos> Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally <eos> For you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through <eos> And don't realize what you did, believe me you <eos> I been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger <eos> I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of <eos> My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead <eos> No more bee flingers, no more drama from now on <eos> I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father <eos> So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters and raise it <eos> You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel <eos> I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub <eos> And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar <eos> I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not <eos> I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid) <eos> To take a stand (to take a stand) <eos> Everybody (Everybody) <eos> Come take my hand come (Come take my hand) <eos> We'll walk this road together, through the storm <eos> Whatever weather, cold or warm <eos> Just letting you know that, you're not alone <eos> Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road <eos>
