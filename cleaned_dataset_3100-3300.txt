I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me <eos> And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me <eos> Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two <eos> And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you" <eos> I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before <eos> And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before <eos> I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true <eos> But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you <eos> The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue <eos> And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you" <eos> The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue <eos> And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you" <eos> "I love you" <eos> "I love you" <eos> "I love you" <eos> "I love you" <eos> "I love you" <eos> 
Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing <eos> You’re like Parker Posey in a magazine <eos> With fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three <eos> I wanna be your dressed in black <eos> Your dark star with the backwards hat <eos> I’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page <eos> Every page <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> I was a desert, honey you were the sand <eos> I was a bird, baby you were the branch <eos> And I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die <eos> It wasn't much, just everything <eos> You could've sat right there and got high with me <eos> But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares <eos> Brought the nightmares <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> 
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone <eos> Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you <eos> I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song <eos> I just can't remember who to send it to <eos> I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Won't you look down upon me, Jesus <eos> You've got to help me make a stand <eos> You've just got to see me through another day <eos> My body's aching and my time is at hand <eos> And I won't make it any other way <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun <eos> Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around <eos> Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come <eos> Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now <eos> Thought I'd see you one more time again <eos> There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now <eos> Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now <eos> 
Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> I'll be the one, if you want me to <eos> Anywhere, I would've followed you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I... am feeling so small <eos> It was over my head <eos> I know nothing at all <eos> And I will stumble and fall <eos> I'm still learning to love <eos> Just starting to crawl <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you <eos> Anywhere, I would've followed you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I will swallow my pride <eos> You're the one that I love <eos> And I'm saying goodbye <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you <eos> And anywhere, I would've followed you, oh-oh <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> Say something... <eos> 
Get off your sled and go to bed <eos> Don't you ever tire? <eos> Throw a bone, I'm finally home <eos> Curled up by the fire <eos> Snow is falling from the sky <eos> Like ashes from an urn <eos> Sweet dreams, my little one <eos> Now it's my turn <eos> Well, Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> Now, when I sleep I like to dream <eos> Of rabbits in the snow <eos> Jumping right into my jaws <eos> From their rabbit hole <eos> Take one home and set him down <eos> Right next to your shoes <eos> Wake up to a big surprise <eos> My gift to you <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> So I'll just stay here and chew <eos> 
...It's just not right, it's <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh, oh <eos> I just wanna see your face at home, home, home <eos> You can't do me right <eos> So I... decide that <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, no more <eos> I just wanna see you up and out, out of the door, oh <eos> I'm not living right <eos> So I... decide that <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh oh <eos> I won't hide the ways, I've tried <eos> It's just not right <eos> It's killing me tonight <eos> So, so <eos>

(Honeycomb) <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> Well it's a darn good life <eos> And it's kinda funny <eos> How the Lord made the bee <eos> And the bee made the honey <eos> And the honeybee lookin' for a home <eos> And they called it honeycomb <eos> And they roamed the world and they gathered all <eos> Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball <eos> And the honeycomb from a million trips <eos> Made my baby's lips <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord said now that I made a bee <eos> I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree <eos> And He made a little tree and I guess you heard <eos> What then, well, he made a little bird <eos> And they waited all around till the end of Spring <eos> Gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing <eos> And they put 'em all into one sweet tome <eos> For my Honeycomb <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord says now that I made a bird <eos> I'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word <eos> That sounds about sweet like "turtledove" <eos> And I guess I'm gonna call it "love" <eos> And He roamed the world lookin' everywhere <eos> Gettin' love from here, love from there <eos> And He put it all in a little ol' part <eos> Of my baby's heart <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> 
In 2028, I woke up late in Spain <eos> Gracias por esta vida <eos> Bought a little place, the view is really great <eos> Thank you for minding your business <eos> In 2029, I travelled back in time <eos> Stanley faked the moon landing <eos> I made some money, landed where it's sunny <eos> Thank you for minding your business <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> In 2032, the world and all we knew <eos> Exploded to millions of pieces <eos> New York City tanked <eos> And California sank deep down into the ocean <eos> In 2033, I woke up as a tree <eos> And found out what I had been missing <eos> I'm a willow tree, happy as can be <eos> Gracias por esta vida <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> I'm daydreaming, I'm daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> 
Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> I find myself growing in an environment <eos> Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent <eos> In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations <eos> I've seen where some have died in desperation <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto) <eos> Hustling is the only education I know <eos> Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle <eos> A situation like this is getting too hard to handle <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> With a pregnant woman, yes <eos> And five kids to care for <eos> Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town <eos> As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me <eos> I pray the day will come when I shall be free from <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh, live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury <eos> Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy <eos> Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon <eos> I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Now a fugitive at large <eos> Could this be my destiny? <eos> With no one to care for the wellfare of my family <eos> In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure <eos> For mind and soul would soon be weary <eos> Just couldn't take no more <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song <eos> 
Verse1 <eos> I sing my Song to you, i give you praise <eos> I lift my hands to You, my voice I raise <eos> Because of who you are <eos> I am who I am <eos> We sing glory to the lamb <eos> You saved My soul from sin, answered my Prayer <eos> Dressed me in righteousness, none can compare <eos> Showed me the path to walk, you showed me your plan <eos> We sing glory to the Lamb <eos> Chorus: <eos> There's one name above, earth and the sky <eos> Lord Jehovah reigns, rules on high <eos> We bow down before You, Great I Am <eos> We Sing Glory to The Lamb <eos> Verse 2 <eos> You are the only one, who gave me hope <eos> Took all the broken dreams and made them whole <eos> You found the best in me and showed me who I am <eos> We sing glory to the lamb <eos> There is no other name, no, that I can call <eos> You Showed me that you are my all in all <eos> Your strength empowers me to be what I can <eos> We Sing glory to the Lamb <eos> Chorus:2x <eos> Bridge: <eos> Lamb of God, holy lamb of God <eos> You are the great I am <eos> You're the King of Kings <eos> You're the Lord of Lords <eos> And we move at your command <eos> Chorus: <eos> Vamp: <eos> Sing halleluyah to risen king <eos> Sing halleluyah let his praises ring <eos> Sing halleluyah to the graet i am <eos> We Sing glory to the lamb <eos> X3 <eos> We Sing glory to the lamb. x4 <eos> 
She just wants to be beautiful <eos> She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits <eos> She craves attention, she praises an image <eos> She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor <eos> Oh, she don't see the light that's shining <eos> Deeper than the eyes can find it <eos> Maybe we have made her blind <eos> So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away <eos> Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made <eos> But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark <eos> You should know you're beautiful just the way you are <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh-oh, oh, oh <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving <eos> You know, covergirls eat nothing <eos> She says "beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything" <eos> "What's a little bit of hunger?" <eos> "I can go a little while longer," she fades away <eos> She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it <eos> Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh <eos> So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror <eos> Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within <eos> There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark <eos> You should know you're beautiful just the way you are <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh-oh, oh, oh <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> No better you than the you that you are <eos> No better you than the you that you are <eos> No better life than the life we're living <eos> No better life than the life we're living <eos> No better time for your shine, you're a star <eos> No better time for your shine, you're a star <eos> Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful <eos> And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark <eos> You should know you're beautiful just the way you are <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh-oh, oh, oh <eos> And you don't have to change a thing <eos> The world could change its heart <eos> No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful <eos> 
You raised the lights when it was frightening <eos> Calmed the storm when it was rising <eos> You found me there where I was hiding <eos> All I have is here and now <eos> If the ground beneath our feet is disappearing <eos> I'll be here beside you, always be right near you <eos> Remember me, won't you? <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> When I was reaching out in the dark <eos> When the streets below just looked so far <eos> When I forgot everything that I was <eos> All I needed was your love <eos> If the earth beneath our feet is old and caves in <eos> For a second we are fighting, when it's late in the evening <eos> Don't let me go, dear <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> As you are <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise (I promise) <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> 
It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear <eos> She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair <eos> And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight" <eos> We go to a party and everyone turns to see <eos> This beautiful lady that's walking around with me <eos> And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight" <eos> I feel wonderful because I see <eos> The love light in your eyes <eos> And the wonder of it all <eos> Is that you just don't realize how much I love you <eos> It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head <eos> So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed <eos> And then I tell her, as I turn out the light <eos> I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight <eos> Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight" <eos> 
She calls me from the cold <eos> Just when I was low, feeling short of stable <eos> And all that she intends <eos> And all she keeps inside, isn't on the label <eos> She says she's ashamed <eos> Can she take me for a while? <eos> And can I be a friend? <eos> We'll forget the past <eos> Or maybe I'm not able <eos> And I break at the bend <eos> We're here and now <eos> Will we ever be again? <eos> 'Cause I have found <eos> All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade <eos> Away again <eos> She dreams a champagne dream <eos> Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper <eos> Lavender and cream <eos> Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her <eos> She says that love is for fools who fall behind <eos> And I'm somewhere between <eos> I never really know <eos> A killer from a savior <eos> 'Til I break at the bend <eos> We're here and now <eos> Will we ever be again? <eos> 'Cause I have found <eos> All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade <eos> Away again <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah oh <eos> Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah ah oh <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah ah oh <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Guess I'll let it go <eos> 
Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say <eos> Just like children sleeping we can dream this night away <eos> But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the night <eos> We go where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> When we were strangers I watched you from afar <eos> When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart <eos> But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high <eos> I want to celebrate see it shining in the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> 
Wake up, it's a beautiful morning <eos> Honey, while the sun is still shining <eos> Wake up, would you like to go with me <eos> Honey, take a run down to the beach <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> Wake up, there's a new kid in the town <eos> Honey, he's moving into the big house <eos> Remember when I was so very hopeless <eos> Darling, he's gonna make it all better <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> Down, down baby <eos> Down by the rollercoaster <eos> Sweet, sweet baby <eos> I'll never let you go <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> 
I'm gonna fight 'em off <eos> A seven nation army couldn't hold me back <eos> They're gonna rip it off <eos> Taking their time right behind my back <eos> And I'm talking to myself at night <eos> Because I can't forget <eos> Back and forth through my mind <eos> Behind a cigarette <eos> And the message coming from my eyes <eos> Says "Leave it alone" <eos> Don't want to hear about it <eos> Every single one's got a story to tell <eos> Everyone knows about it <eos> From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell <eos> And if I catch it coming back my way <eos> I'm gonna serve it to you <eos> And that ain't what you want to hear <eos> But that's what I'll do <eos> And the feeling coming from my bones <eos> Says "Find a home" <eos> I'm going to Wichita <eos> Far from this opera forevermore <eos> I'm gonna work the straw <eos> Make the sweat drip out of every pore <eos> And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding <eos> Right before the Lord <eos> All the words are gonna bleed from me <eos> And I will sing no more <eos> And the stains coming from my blood <eos> Tell me "Go back home" <eos> 
I still can picture him: his hands in his back pockets <eos> He wasn't much for words, but when the wise kids made a racket he'd just have to go downtown <eos> Throw his weight around before starting over <eos> "Say did you hear I've got a band? <eos> Some guys I know from L.A <eos> We'll own the Rio Grande <eos> I'll pay you back next Friday <eos> You know it sure isn't big, just some cats I dig <eos> They said they'd do the gig" <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out in the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun <eos> Not for the younger <eos> Oh Jack Daniels, I feel your hunger <eos> I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not <eos> I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot <eos> You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin <eos> Just a momento <eos> So sad you loved in vain <eos> My comrades lost in battle <eos> The music wars are done from London to Seattle <eos> We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out on the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Ready to die <eos> Now he's ready to die <eos> 
Well I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> Yes, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> I said <eos> Brother, you know, you know <eos> It's a long road we've been walking on <eos> Yes it is,  yes it is, you know it is <eos> Such a long road we've been walking on <eos> Oh, brother, oh, brother <eos> And I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> I said <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Here is what I know now <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Oh, but you know I am so weary <eos> And you know <eos> My heart, my heart's been broken now <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> My mind is too strong to carry on <eos> Too strong, too strong to carry on <eos> But when I am alone <eos> When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone <eos> When I've lost all care for the things I own <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> You who are my home <eos> You who are my home now <eos> And here is what I know now, brother <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Your love now <eos> Well, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by now <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos>

I bet you're wondering how I knew <eos> 'Bout your plans to make me blue <eos> With some other guy you knew before <eos> Between the two of us guys <eos> You know I love you more <eos> It took me by surprise, I must say <eos> When I found out yesterday <eos> Don't you know that <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> I know a man ain't supposed to cry <eos> But these tears I can't hold inside <eos> Losing you would end my life you see <eos> Because you mean that much to me <eos> You could have told me yourself <eos> That you love someone else <eos> Instead <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> And I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> People say "believe half of what you see <eos> Son and none of what you hear" <eos> But I can't help being confused <eos> If it's true please tell me dear: <eos> Do you plan to let me go <eos> For the other guy you loved before? <eos> Don't you know <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine, baby <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> It's not warm when she's away <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And she's always gone too long <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Wonder this time where she's gone <eos> Wonder if she's gonna stay <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And this house just ain't no home <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know <eos> Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone <eos> But ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> Only darkness everyday <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And this house just ain't no home <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> 
O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Bltter! <eos> Du grnst nicht nur <eos> Zur Sommerzeit <eos> Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Bltter! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit <eos> Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Dein Kleid will mich <eos> Was lehren: <eos> Die Hoffnung und Bestndigkeit <eos> Gibt Trost und Kraft <eos> Zu jeder Zeit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Das soll dein Kleid <eos> Mich lehren <eos> 
Latched to this life like a death-grip we're satisfied <eos> With the mundane and keeping out of sight <eos> But still we are young <eos> We are young <eos> I'll stare them angels down <eos> Keep them in the back room, shut the door and let go <eos> Now we stare at the grave cold and paralyzed <eos> Pushing daisies while we still feel the sunshine <eos> We are young <eos> We are young <eos> Slip through the marigolds and please our damaged souls <eos> This place is holding me <eos> Jump through the rope, let's make it credible <eos> When blood is all we see <eos> Life is impossible <eos> Death is coming ‘round like a hurricane swirling <eos> We're on the clock and the needle's turning <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out <eos> You're just another one wandering aimlessly until the grave <eos> The signs of the times are upon us all <eos> We're bleeding for tomorrow <eos> Sucking on the mother's dead tit of sorrow, sorrow <eos> It's alright, we'll learn it all before we go <eos> Snapped by the neck as we follow <eos> Chin up, now tighten the rope <eos> Leave it all hollow <eos> This place is holding me <eos> Jump through the rope, let's make it credible <eos> When blood is all we see <eos> Life is impossible <eos> Death is coming ‘round like a hurricane swirling <eos> We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out <eos> No funeral, no pyre left burning <eos> This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out <eos> (If I were the devil, I would promote an attitude of loving things and using people, instead of the other way around <eos> I would make it legal to take the life of the unborn <eos> Make it socially acceptable to take one's own life, and invent machines to make it more convenient <eos> I would attack the family, the backbone of every nation <eos> I would come up with drugs that sedate the mind and target the young, and I would get sports heroes to advertise them) <eos> I guess I will just leave things the way they are <eos> This place is holding me (This place is holding me) <eos> Jump through the rope, let's make it credible (Credible) <eos> When blood is all we see, life is impossible <eos> (Death is coming 'round like a hurricane swirling <eos> We're on the clock and the needle's turning <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out) <eos> Death is coming ‘round like a hurricane swirling <eos> We're on the clock and the needle's turning fast <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out <eos> No funeral, no pyre left burning <eos> This body's dust in the wind that's hurling past <eos> The misery's killing me slowly <eos> Give me a spine to work it out <eos>

The lies, the weight <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> The lies, the weight <eos> It's clear I lost my way <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> Decomposing <eos> I thought I was an architect, but I was just moving dirt <eos> Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> Boring the barriers that kept others away <eos> The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall <eos> So now I know there is no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my lies <eos> Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great <eos> Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape <eos> Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my pride crushing me <eos> Beneath my lies collapsing <eos> But we are still alive <eos> We are still alive <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> My own grave <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive, buried alive <eos> Finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> What I'd become in my own grave <eos> Buried in my own grave alive <eos> 
Tell me somethin', girl <eos> Are you happy in this modern world? <eos> Or do you need more? <eos> Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? <eos> I'm falling <eos> In all the good times I find myself <eos> Longin' for change <eos> And in the bad times I fear myself <eos> Tell me something, boy <eos> Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? <eos> Or do you need more? <eos> Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? <eos> I'm falling <eos> In all the good times I find myself <eos> Longing for change <eos> And in the bad times I fear myself <eos> I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <eos> I'll never meet the ground <eos> Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Whoah! <eos> I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <eos> I'll never meet the ground <eos> Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos>

It's somewhere lost <eos> Forever more <eos> My demons come for me <eos> When they hear my voice <eos> Ooh you <eos> La da da da da <eos> Oooh <eos> Avoid some day <eos> Smoke with you the other day <eos> We can love (love) oh <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> Avoid some day <eos> Smoke with you the other day <eos> We can love oh <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> How can I talk to you <eos> I caught your eye across the room <eos> Do we even need the truth for now <eos> How can I talk to you <eos> Our loving we should resume <eos> I fall in love <eos> Your perfume <eos> 
I get lost in your eyes <eos> And I feel my spirits rise <eos> And soar like the wind <eos> Is it love that I am in? <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> And now I know <eos> 'Cause when I'm lost <eos> I can let go <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I just fell <eos> Don't know why <eos> Something's there we can't deny <eos> And when I first knew <eos> Was when I first looked at you <eos> And if I can't find my way <eos> If salvation is worlds away <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> Oh it's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos>

La, la, la, la, la <eos> La, la, la, la, la <eos> I wrote her off for the tenth time today <eos> And practiced all the things I would say <eos> But she came over, I lost my nerve <eos> I took her back and made her dessert <eos> Now I know I'm being used <eos> That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse <eos> I know she's playing with me <eos> That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> We make plans to go out at night <eos> I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light <eos> This rejection's got me so low <eos> If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Now I'll relate this little bit <eos> It happens more than I'd like to admit <eos> Late at night, she knocks on my door <eos> She's drunk again and looking to score <eos> Now I know I should say no <eos> But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go <eos> I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb <eos> I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right?

Je l'ai connue <eos> Un soir <eos> Dans la nuit <eos> Sur le tard <eos> Elle était là <eos> Devant moi <eos> Quand j’ai fait <eos> Trois pas en avant <eos> Ma main dans la sienne <eos> Caresse ses cheveux <eos> Mes yeux dans ses yeux <eos> Et ses lèvres contre les miennes <eos> Quand je l ai vue, c'est là que j'ai perdu <eos> Ma venus de saturne <eos> Ma déesse nocturne <eos> Aucune fille de joie <eos> Ne te remplacera <eos> Et puis un jour <eos> C’était fini <eos> On s est quitté <eos> Sur le trottoir <eos> Et  on est parti <eos> Pour une autre vie <eos> Mais elle a laissé <eos> Son fantôme de sirène <eos> Parfois je rêve <eos> Et je la vois <eos> Mais quand je me lève <eos> Elle n'est plus là <eos> Ma venus de saturne <eos> Ma déesse nocturne <eos> Mon amour <eos> Aucune fille de joie <eos> Ne te remplacera <eos> Et quand je repense <eos> A son parfum <eos> A mes doigt dans ses cheveux <eos> Sa main dans la mienne <eos> Et son regard <eos> De sirène <eos> Je n'ai plus froid au coeur <eos> Je n'ai plus peur <eos> Et si un jour <eos> Nous nous retrouvons <eos> Dans une autre vie <eos> Peut-être au paradis <eos> Je mettrai ma main <eos> Dans ses cheveux <eos> Ses lèvres contre les miennes <eos> Caresse tes seins <eos> Du bout des doigts <eos> Danser avec toi <eos> Comme autrefois <eos> Et nos deux corps <eos> Ne feront plus qu'un <eos> 
We get some rules to follow <eos> That and this, these and those <eos> No one knows <eos> We get these pills to swallow <eos> How they stick in your throat <eos> Tastes like gold <eos> Oh, what you do to me <eos> No one knows <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> I journey through the desert <eos> Of the mind with no hope <eos> I follow <eos> I drift along the ocean <eos> Dead lifeboat in the sun <eos> End come undone <eos> Pleasantly caving in <eos> I come undone <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> Heaven smiles above me <eos> What a gift here below <eos> But no one knows <eos> A gift that you give to me <eos> No one knows <eos> Ustedes que son padres de familia... <eos> …Buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el <eos> "DJ Héctor Bonifacio Echevarría Cervantes de la Cruz Arroyo Rojas" <eos> Esta es la radio Quetzalcoatl <eos> Estación donde el rock vive y no muere <eos> Vamos a escuchar un par de temas de Queens of the Stone Age <eos> Primero vamos a escuchar "First It Giveth..." <eos> ...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… <eos>

I heard that you're settled down <eos> That you found a girl and you're married now <eos> I heard that your dreams came true <eos> Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you <eos> Old friend, why are you so shy? <eos> Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light <eos> I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited <eos> But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it <eos> I had hoped you'd see my face <eos> And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> You know how the time flies <eos> Only yesterday was the time of our lives <eos> We were born and raised in a summer haze <eos> Bound by the surprise of our glory days <eos> I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited <eos> But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it <eos> I had hoped you'd see my face <eos> And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Nothing compares, no worries or cares <eos> Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made <eos> Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> 
Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear <eos> We're still goodbying <eos> As long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> He doesn't care if it's in below <eos> He's sitting <eos> By the fires glossy glow <eos> He don't care about the cold <eos> And the winds that blow <eos> He just says, let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> Ooh, wee, goes the storm <eos> Why should he worry <eos> When he's nice and warm? <eos> His girl by his side <eos> And the lights turned low <eos> He just says <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> I don't care <eos> Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But that fire is, mmm, delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought lots of corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> When we finally say good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you'll only hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> Long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> 
I know you're somewhere out there <eos> Somewhere far away <eos> I want you back, I want you back <eos> My neighbors think I'm crazy <eos> But they don't understand <eos> You're all I had, you're all I had <eos> At night when the stars light up my room <eos> I sit by myself <eos> Talking to the moon <eos> Tryna get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town <eos> They say I've gone mad <eos> Yeah, I've gone mad <eos> But they don't know what I know <eos> 'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back <eos> Yeah, they're talking back, oh <eos> At night when the stars light up my room <eos> I sit by myself <eos> Talking to the moon <eos> Tryna get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> Do you ever hear me calling? <eos> Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh <eos> 'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon <eos> Still trying to get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> Oh-oh <eos> I know you're somewhere out there <eos> Somewhere far away <eos> 
Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> De mi Cuba soberana, recuerdo aquel murmurillo <eos> Del río, junto al  bohío que era una estampa cubana <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> La libertad fue un trofeo, que nos conquistó el Bambi <eos> Con el verbo de Martí, y el machete de Maceo <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> "Yo soy un hombre sincero", dijo Martí, de donde crece la palma <eos> Y antes de morirme quiero, cantar mis versos del alma <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Cultivó una rosa blanca, en junio como en enero <eos> Para el amigo sincero que me da su mano franca <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos>

All is calm and all is bright <eos> Everywhere but in your heart tonight <eos> They're singing carols of joy and peace <eos> But you feel too far gone and too far out of reach <eos> Somewhere in your silent night <eos> Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried <eos> Hope is here, just lift your head <eos> For love has come to find you <eos> Somewhere in your silent night <eos> From Heaven's height to manger low <eos> There is no distance the Prince of Peace won't go <eos> From manger low to Calvary's hill <eos> When your pain runs deep, His love runs deeper still <eos> He has always loved you, child <eos> And He always will <eos> Somewhere in your silent night <eos> Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried <eos> Hope is here, just lift your head <eos> For love has come to find you <eos> Somewhere in your silent night <eos> Lift your head, lift your heart <eos> Emmanuel will meet you where you are <eos> He knows your hurt, He knows your name <eos> And you're the very reason that He came <eos> Somewhere in your silent night <eos> Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried <eos> Hope is here, just lift your head <eos> For love has come to find you <eos> Somewhere in your silent night... <eos> Love will find you <eos> Love will find you <eos> Love will find you <eos>

I swear I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And I barely still remember <eos> Who's in the pictures on my wall <eos> 'Cause, no, I can't <eos> Recall your scent <eos> Jasmine, tuberose, and lily <eos> Or your silly French accent <eos> All but forgotten <eos> About those eyes <eos> The shade of green that if he'd seen <eos> Would make F. Scott Fitzgerald cry <eos> But I won't <eos> Break down at 2 AM and call <eos> 'Cause I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And I'm sleepin' fine <eos> I don't mean to boast <eos> But I only dream about you <eos> Once or twice a night at most <eos> And it feels so good <eos> Eating alone <eos> I don't get distracted by your smile <eos> And miss the green lights drivin' home <eos> No sign of stoppin' <eos> The house isn't far <eos> But I think our song is comin' on <eos> And now I wanna crash the car <eos> But I won't <eos> Make that mistake again and fall <eos> So I say I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And someday I won't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me <eos> I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream) <eos> Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why <eos> Without you, it's hard to survive <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky <eos> They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry) <eos> The good and the bad times, we've been through them all <eos> You make me rise when I fall <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 
April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom <eos> Holiday tables under the trees <eos> April in Paris, this is a feeling <eos> That no one can ever reprise <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What did you mean to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos> 

Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine <eos> Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything <eos> When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes <eos> Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild <eos> When she drives me wild <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out <eos> Till she changes her mind <eos> Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV" <eos> And she falls asleep <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She's unpredictable, unforgettable <eos> It's unusual, unbelievable <eos> How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy <eos> But her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> Her crazy's beautiful to me <eos>

Lying in my bed <eos> I hear the clock tick, and think of you <eos> Caught up in circles <eos> Confusion is nothing new <eos> Flashback, warm nights <eos> Almost left behind <eos> Suitcase of memories <eos> Time after— <eos> Sometimes, you picture me <eos> I'm walking too far ahead <eos> You're calling to me <eos> I can't hear what you've said <eos> Then you say, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> After my picture fades <eos> And darkness has turned to gray <eos> Watching through windows <eos> You're wondering if I'm okay <eos> Secrets stolen from deep inside <eos> The drum beats out of time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> You said, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos>

There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos> 
(Ah) Georgia <eos> Georgia <eos> The whole day through <eos> (The whole day through) <eos> Just an old, sweet song <eos> Keeps Georgia on my mind <eos> (Georgia on my mind) <eos> I said a-Georgia <eos> Georgia <eos> A song of you <eos> (A song of you) <eos> Comes as sweet and clear <eos> As moonlight through the pines <eos> Other arms a-reach out to me <eos> Other eyes smile tenderly <eos> Still, in the peaceful dreams, I see <eos> The road leads back to you <eos> I said, Georgia, oh, Georgia <eos> No peace I find <eos> Just an old, sweet song <eos> Keeps Georgia on my mind <eos> (Georgia on my mind, oh) <eos> Other arms a-reach out to me <eos> Other eyes smile tenderly <eos> Still, in peaceful dreams, I see <eos> The road leads back to you <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Georgia <eos> Georgia <eos> No peace, no peace I find <eos> Just an old, sweet song <eos> Keeps Georgia on my mind <eos> (Georgia on my mind) <eos> I said, just an old, sweet song <eos> Keeps Georgia on my mind <eos> 
We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> The music played <eos> While our bodies <eos> Displayed through the dance <eos> Then love picked us out for romance <eos> I thought it was clear <eos> The plan was we would share <eos> This feeling just between ourselves <eos> But when the music changed <eos> The plan was rearranged <eos> He went to dance with someone else <eos> We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> But now he's with somebody new <eos> What does love want me to do? <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Guess he's discovered <eos> We are truly lovers <eos> Magic from the very start <eos> 'Cause love just kept me groovin' <eos> And he felt me movin' <eos> Even though we danced apart <eos> So we started dancing <eos> And love put us into the groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Love said <eos> (Let the music play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> (He won't get away) <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away... <eos> 
I will always love you <eos> How I do <eos> I let go of a prayer for you <eos> Just a sweet word <eos> The table is prepared for you <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Wishing you godspeed, glory <eos> There will be mountains you won't move <eos> Still I'll always be there for you <eos> How I do <eos> I let go of my claim on you <eos> It's a free world <eos> You look down on where you came from sometimes <eos> Still you'll have this place to call home always <eos> Glory, glory <eos> Glory, glory <eos> This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes <eos> Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind <eos> This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes <eos> Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind <eos> This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes <eos> Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind <eos> This love will keep us from blinding of the eyes <eos> Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind <eos>

Come on, skinny love, just last the year <eos> Pour a little salt, we were never here <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer <eos> I tell my love to wreck it all <eos> Cut out all the ropes and let me fall <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Right in this moment, this order's tall <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And in the morning I'll be with you <eos> But it will be a different kind <eos> And I'll be holding all the tickets <eos> And you'll be owning all the fines <eos> Come on, skinny love, what happened here? <eos> Suckle on the hope in light brassieres <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Sullen load is full, so slow on the split <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And now all your love is wasted <eos> And then who the hell was I? <eos> And I'm breaking at the britches <eos> And at the end of all your lines <eos> Who will love you? <eos> Who will fight? <eos> Who will fall far behind? <eos> 
Silent night, holy night <eos> All is calm, all is bright <eos> Round yon virgin, mother and child <eos> Holy infant, so tender and mild <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> Silent night, holy night <eos> Shepherds quake at the sight <eos> Glory streams from Heaven afar <eos> Heavenly hosts sing "Alleluia <eos> Christ the Savior is born! <eos> Christ the Savior is born!" <eos>

My shattered dreams and broken heart <eos> Are mending on the shelf <eos> I saw you holding hands <eos> Standing close to someone else <eos> Now I sit all alone <eos> Wishing all my feeling was gone <eos> I gave my best to you <eos> Nothing for me to do <eos> But have one last cry <eos> One last cry <eos> Before I leave it all behind <eos> I've gotta put you out of my mind this time <eos> Stop living a lie <eos> I guess I'm down to my last cry <eos> I was here, you were there <eos> Guess we never could agree <eos> While the sun shines on you <eos> I need some love to rain on me <eos> Still I sit all alone <eos> Wishing all my feeling was gone <eos> Gotta get over you <eos> Nothing for me to do <eos> But have one last cry <eos> One last cry <eos> Before I leave it all behind <eos> I've gotta put you out of my mind this time <eos> Stop living a lie <eos> I know I gotta be strong <eos> 'Cause round me life goes on and on and on and on <eos> I'm gonna dry my eyes <eos> Right after I end my one last cry <eos> One last cry <eos> Before I leave it all behind <eos> I've gotta put you out of my mind for the very last time <eos> Been living a lie <eos> I guess I'm down <eos> I guess I'm down <eos> I guess I'm down <eos> To my last cry <eos> 
Walking on a dream <eos> How can I explain? <eos> Talking to myself <eos> Will I see again? <eos> We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <eos> Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it <eos> On and on and on we are calling out, out again <eos> Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Thought I'd never see <eos> The love you found in me <eos> Now it's changing all the time <eos> Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time <eos> We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <eos> Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it <eos> On and on and on we are calling out, out again <eos> Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Catch me, I'm falling down <eos> Catch me, I'm falling down <eos> Don't stop, just keep going on <eos> I'm your shoulder, lean upon <eos> So come on, deliver from inside <eos> All we got is tonight, that is right 'till first light <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos>

Barefoot in the sand <eos> Wishing God would lend a hand <eos> Wave after wave comes crashing down <eos> Washing away a little more ground <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Walking along with the ocean at my heels <eos> Loving the way the water feels <eos> Up in the sky something catches my eye <eos> As bright as a star in the northern sky <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want to touch you <eos>

Me prendo un gallito y luego me levanto <eos> Me miro y yo en el espejo me pongo a pensar <eos> Me cambio, me llevo Buchanan's y marihuana <eos> Y prendo ya mi troquita, me voy ir a enfiestar <eos> Ya llegué, la música suena <eos> Pero bien endrogado con muchas mujere' para amanecer <eos> Me encuentro una mujer bien hermosa, sí <eos> Olía muchas mariposa', su forma de sonreír <eos> Y así suena, Porte Diferente, chiquita <eos> Su compa, Natanael Cano, viejones <eos> No te vayas a enamorar más de mí <eos> Porque yo no soy lo que piensas <eos> Te puedo hacer sufrir <eos> Te lo advierto, no quiero que digas que me amas <eos> Porque cada día ando con otra <eos> No te lo voy a volver a decir <eos> Vete ya, porque tú sabes que sufrirás de más <eos> Soy imbécil, pues tú ya sabes <eos> Yo no sé amar <eos> No te debo que dar tanta explicación <eos> Espero ya, gente me derrotaron <eos> Todos mis cariños <eos> 
Time after time <eos> I tell myself that I'm <eos> So lucky to be loving you <eos> So lucky to be <eos> The one you run to see <eos> In the evening, when the day is through <eos> I only know what I know <eos> The passing years will show <eos> You've kept my love so young, so new <eos> And time after time <eos> You'll hear me say that I'm <eos> So lucky to be loving you <eos> 
From this moment, life has begun <eos> From this moment, you are the one <eos> Right beside you is where I belong <eos> From this moment on <eos> From this moment, I have been blessed <eos> I live only for your happiness <eos> And for your love, I'd give my last breath <eos> From this moment on <eos> I give my hand to you with all my heart <eos> I can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start <eos> You and I will never be apart <eos> My dreams came true because of you <eos> From this moment, as long as I live <eos> I will love you, I promise you this <eos> There is nothing I wouldn't give <eos> From this moment on <eos> Ohh <eos> You're the reason I believe in love <eos> And you're the answer to my prayers from up above <eos> All we need is just the two of us <eos> My dreams came true because of you <eos> From this moment, as long as I live <eos> I will love you, I promise you this <eos> There is nothing I wouldn't give <eos> From this moment <eos> I will love you, as long as I live <eos> From this moment on <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos>

I want to hold the hand inside you <eos> I want to take a breath that's true <eos> I look to you and I see nothing <eos> I look to you to see the truth <eos> You live your life, you go in shadows <eos> You'll come apart and you'll go blind <eos> Some kind of night into your darkness <eos> Colors your eyes with what's not there <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos> A stranger's light comes on slowly <eos> A stranger's heart without a home <eos> You put your hands into your head <eos> And then its smiles cover your heart <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you nеver knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strangе you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos>

Nadie quiere besar a una chica vestida de negro <eos> Preocúpate por ti, bebé, yo estaré bien <eos> Solo quiero morir en paz esta noche <eos> Puedes verlo en mi rostro, así que me pongo mi capucha <eos> Siento que está a 5 grados esta noche <eos> Todos son fríos de donde vengo <eos> Corta a tu hombre, solo buscabas un ascenso <eos> El siguiente verano estaré en una isla, con tu perra, una botella y un bolsillo lleno de billetes <eos> No tartamudeo, hablo mal desde el barrio <eos> Tengo una bala para tu cara <eos> Obtuve mi nombre por mi madre <eos> Ningún otro brilla a través del obturador <eos> Ella está sobre mi <eos> Lo que sea, ella está bajo mi covertor <eos> Apuesto que desearías tener mi flow <eos> Sé que estoy fumado, podría preguntarle a tu puta <eos> Apuesto que me quieres volver loco <eos> No, no lo harías, nunca <eos> Para de hacer sonar mi celular <eos> Tú, regrésalo de nuevo <eos> Preocúpate por ti, bebé, yo estaré bien <eos> Solo quiero morir en paz esta noche <eos> Puedes verlo en mi rostro, así que me pongo mi capucha <eos> Siento que está a 5 grados esta noche <eos> Todos son fríos de donde vengo <eos> Corta a tu hombre, solo buscabas un ascenso <eos> El siguiente verano estaré en una isla, con tu perra, una botella y un bolsillo lleno de billetes <eos>

If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man <eos> You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me <eos> The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say <eos> I don't share your greed, the only card I need is <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil <eos> Going with the flow, it's all a game to me <eos> Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you <eos> Double up or quit, double stake or split <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools <eos> But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever <eos> And don't forget the joker! <eos> Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me <eos> Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again <eos> I see it in your eyes, take one look and die <eos> The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos>

Well, I'm an overthinker, a daydreamer <eos> A heavy drinker, an in-betweener <eos> Proppin' up the bar, like it's gonna fall down <eos> I'm a shit-talker, a bad joker <eos> A Johnny Walker, a chain smoker <eos> Everyone knows it all over town <eos> And I know we've just met <eos> And you don't know my deal yet <eos> But I wondered if you would <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos> 'Cause I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Until the mornin' light <eos> Help me remember to forget, yeah <eos> 'Cause I'm a future gazer, a past dweller <eos> And I've always been a storyteller <eos> But no one's listening anymore <eos> And I'm a latecomer, a last chancer <eos> A slow runner and a final dancer <eos> You see me glide across the floor <eos> And I know it sounds strange <eos> And I've got nothing to exchange <eos> But I wondered if you could <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos> And I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Until the mornin' light <eos> Help me remember to forget, ee yeah <eos> So help me remember to forget <eos> 'Cause I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Till the morning light <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos>

Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A s'offrir en partage <eos> Au jour du grand voyage <eos> Qu'est notre grand amour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Mon amour toi et moi <eos> Pour qu'éclatent de joie <eos> Chaque heure et chaque jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour vivre nos promesses <eos> Sans nulle autre richesse <eos> Que d'y croire toujours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour meubler de merveilles <eos> Et couvrir de soleil <eos> La laideur des faubourgs <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour unique raison <eos> Pour unique chanson <eos> Et unique secours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour habiller matin <eos> Pauvres et malandrins <eos> De manteaux de velours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir en prière <eos> Pour les maux de la terre <eos> En simple troubadour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir à ceux-là <eos> Dont l'unique combat <eos> Est de chercher le jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour tracer un chemin <eos> Et forcer le destin <eos> A chaque carrefour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour parler aux canons <eos> Et rien qu'une chanson <eos> Pour convaincre un tambour <eos> Alors sans avoir rien <eos> Que la force d'aimer <eos> Nous aurons dans nos mains <eos> Amis le monde entier <eos> 
Do you remember happy together? <eos> I do, don't you? <eos> Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach <eos> Is that still true? <eos> You said, "forever," in the end I fought it <eos> Please be honest, are we better for it? <eos> Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called <eos> And said, "I miss you" <eos> I caught it <eos> Good to each other, give it the summer <eos> I knew, you too <eos> But I only saw you once in December <eos> I'm still confused <eos> You said, "forever," and I almost bought it <eos> I miss fighting in your old apartment <eos> Breaking dishes when you're disappointed <eos> I still love you, I promise <eos> Nothing happened in the way I wanted <eos> Every corner of this house is haunted <eos> And I know you said that we're not talking <eos> But I miss you, I'm sorry <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos>

I wore makeup when we dated <eos> 'Cause I thought you'd like me more <eos> If I looked like the other prom queens <eos> I know that you loved before <eos> Tried so hard to be everything that you liked <eos> Just for you to say you're not the compliment type <eos> And I knew how you took your coffee <eos> And your favorite songs by heart <eos> I read all of your self-help books <eos> So you'd think that I was smart <eos> Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me <eos> I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave <eos> You found someonе more exciting <eos> The nеxt second, you were gone <eos> And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong <eos> And you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you <eos> Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you <eos> And maybe I'm just not as interesting <eos> As the girls you had before <eos> But God, you couldn't have cared less <eos> About someone who loved you more <eos> I'd say you broke my heart <eos> But you broke much more than that <eos> Now I don't want your sympathy <eos> I just want myself back <eos> Before you found someone more exciting <eos> The next second, you were gone <eos> And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong <eos> And you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough <eos> And don't you think I loved you too much <eos> To be used and discarded? <eos> Don't you think I loved you too much <eos> To think I deserve nothing? <eos> But don't tell me you're sorry, boy <eos> Feel sorry for yourself <eos> 'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else <eos> And they'll think that I am so exciting <eos> Then you'll be the one who's crying <eos> Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> You say I'm never satisfied <eos> But that's not me, it's you <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough <eos> But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you <eos> Enough for you, oh <eos> No, nothing's enough for you <eos>

De madrugada desperte pesando en la noche de ayer <eos> Y recorri parte de mi vida <eos> Son muchos que perdi y algunos que siguen aqui <eos> Pero no hay nada que soñar me impida <eos> Cuantos amores me gane y cuantos fracase <eos> Pero sigo amando porque es mi vida <eos> Cuando amigos conoci y cuantos que perdi <eos> Pero sigo con los que mas queria <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, de noche puedo sentir tu piel <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, me agarras la mano antes de caer <eos> Otra vez <eos> Cuantas canciones que cante y cuantas que llore <eos> Pero sigo cantando porque es mi vida <eos> Cuantas noches te perdi pero hoy te tengo aqui <eos> No voy a dejarte nunca mas mi vida <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, de noche puedo sentir tu piel <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, me agarras la mano antes de caer <eos> 
My love <eos> There's only you in my life <eos> The only thing that's right <eos> My first love <eos> You're every breath that I take <eos> You're every step I make <eos> And I <eos> I want to share <eos> All my love with you <eos> No one else will do <eos> And your eyes <eos> Your eyes, your eyes <eos> They tell me how much you care <eos> Ooh yes, you will always be <eos> My endless love <eos> Two hearts <eos> Two hearts that beat as one <eos> Our lives have just begun <eos> Forever <eos> (Ohhhhhh) <eos> I'll hold you close in my arms <eos> I can't resist your charms <eos> And love <eos> Oh, love <eos> I'll be a fool <eos> For you <eos> I'm sure <eos> You know I don't mind <eos> Oh, you know I don't mind <eos> Cause you <eos> You mean the world to me <eos> Oh <eos> I know <eos> I know <eos> I've found in you <eos> My endless love <eos> Oooh-woow <eos> Boom, boom  <eos> And love <eos> Oh, love <eos> I'll be a fool <eos> For you <eos> I'm sure <eos> You know I don't mind <eos> Oh, you know I don't mind <eos> And, yes <eos> You'll be the only one <eos> Cause no one can deny <eos> This love I have inside <eos> And I'll give it all to you <eos> My love <eos> My love, my love <eos> My endless love <eos>

Me has hecho tanta falta <eos> Hoy me siento tan solo <eos> Que me estara pasando <eos> Te necesito aqui <eos> No puedo consolarme <eos> Si no tengo tus besos <eos> Que me estara pasando <eos> Hay corazon por ti <eos> Me estoy enamorando hoy de ti <eos> Pero perdidamente <eos> Yo que tanto decia que jamas <eos> Me volveria a pasar <eos> Me estoy enamorando hoy de ti <eos> Desespéradamente <eos> Yo no me lo esperaba <eos> Pero te amo cada dia mas <eos> Pero de que manera <eos> Me estube preguntando <eos> Yo que ni lo pensaba <eos> Ni me lo presenti <eos> No puedo estar sin verte <eos> Siempre te estoy soñando <eos> Que me estara pasando <eos> Ya no vivo sin ti <eos> Me estoy enamorando hoy de ti <eos> Pero perdidamente <eos> Yo que tanto decia que jamas <eos> Me volveria a pasar <eos> Me estoy enamorando hoy de ti <eos> Desespéradamente <eos> Yo no me lo esperaba <eos> Pero te amo cada dia mas <eos> 
There's an hourglass sitting on the table <eos> I'm watching as everything's changing <eos> My mind goes to a different time <eos> Old love I remember falling so madly <eos> There must've been magic in the valley <eos> And a rhythm in the night <eos> 'Cause I could almost see it <eos> Did you fade right out of view <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Sometimes there's shadows growing in my mind <eos> Like a sundial in the nighttime but if i close my eyes <eos> I think I still see it <eos> Sunlight coming through <eos> CHORUS <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Oh if it takes time <eos> Where you go I'll keep on running <eos> I hope you know that I'll keep coming <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> 
Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Esto que siento me supera y no lo aguanto <eos> Sin ti los días pasan sin su encanto <eos> No tengo nada en mi defensa, sabes que no soy un santo <eos> Pero si me lo preguntas, quizá no era para tanto <eos> Yo dando potes <eos> Gritando tu nombre con fuerza pa' que lo notes <eos> Camino donde caminas esperando que te topes <eos> Soñando que me llamas y voy a todo galope <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la nochе ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienеs, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la noche ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienes, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Te quise más de lo que tú me quisiste <eos> Inestable desde que te fuiste y muy triste <eos> Mi consciencia dice: "¿Acaso enloqueciste?" <eos> Y yo no sé qué decirle, me tiembla la voz <eos> Ya no veo tu luz <eos> Ahora estás lejos, ya no hay plenitud <eos> ¿Ahora cómo le haré pa' agarrar altitud? <eos> Me haces falta, no hay como tú, auh <eos> Me acostumbré a no estar solo, uh, uh <eos> Ando ansioso y no lo controlo, uh-uh-uh, uh <eos> Estoy consciente de toda la razón que había en la gente <eos> Te doy tu despedida, mi amor, un beso en la frente <eos> Lo mío por ti seguirá latente <eos> Detente, permíteme mirarte bien, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos>

The smile, the charm, the words, the spark, everything, you had it <eos> Guess I had a naive heart, 'cause boy I let you have it <eos> You said I was your only, never thought you'd leave me lonely <eos> You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds <eos> You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground <eos> Always gonna fly away <eos> Just because you know you can <eos> Never gonna learn there's no such place <eos> As Neverland, you don't understand <eos> You'll never grow up <eos> You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan <eos> Deep down, I knew that you were too good to be true <eos> But every piece and part of me wanted to believe in you <eos> Now it's happily ever never, I guess now I know better <eos> You're just a lost boy, with your head up in the clouds <eos> You're just a lost boy, never keep your feet on the ground <eos> Always gonna fly away <eos> Just because you know you can <eos> Never gonna learn there's no such place <eos> As Neverland, you don't understand <eos> You'll never grow up <eos> You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan <eos> You're just a lost boy, yeah, I know who you are <eos> And you don't know what you lost, boy, too busy chasing stars <eos> And you're always gonna fly away <eos> Just because you know you can <eos> Never gonna learn there's no such place <eos> As Neverland, you don't understand <eos> You'll never grow up <eos> You're never gonna be a man <eos> You're never grow up, yeah <eos> You're never gonna be a man, Peter Pan <eos> Never gonna be a man <eos> 
The night has fallen down the staircase <eos> And I, for one, have felt its bruises <eos> Equilbrium, inebriated <eos> Our social graces have been displaced <eos> As we sink deeper into the drink <eos> The volume increases <eos> Night time resurrects fault lines <eos> Silent wars rumble somewhere below <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The shoe is dropped, lungs explode <eos> Shards of words of a shattered voice <eos> And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> The moon is rising, a revolution <eos> I close my eyes, and the room is spinning <eos> You're screaming, "Sweetie, the moon has raped me <eos> It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me <eos> So I must learn to abort these feelings <eos> This romance is bleeding" <eos> Night time triggers the land mines <eos> Bedroom wounds, lovers like brigadiers <eos> Marching two by two <eos> Marching two by two <eos> A soldier's down <eos> Flood gates burst <eos> I've said things I wish you'd never heard <eos> Like, "There's still a hole <eos> Where the phone was thrown" <eos> It's growing as we speak <eos> And it's sucking us both in <eos> A vacuum of sorrow <eos> To swallow up the day <eos> 
Letra de "Dígale" <eos> No ha podido olvidar mi corazón <eos> Aquellos ojos tristes soñadores que yo amé <eos> La dejé por conquistar una ilusión <eos> Y perdí su rastro, y ahora sé que es ella <eos> Todo lo que yo buscaba <eos> Y ahora estoy aqui <eos> Buscándola de nuevo <eos> Ya no está, se fue <eos> Tal vez usted la ha visto digale <eos> Que yo siempre la adoré <eos> Y que nunca la olvidé <eos> Que mi vida es un desierto y muero yo de sed <eos> Y digale también, que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar <eos> No hay brillo en las estrellas <eos> Ya ni el sol, me calienta <eos> Y estoy muy solo aqui, no sé a donde fue <eos> Por favor digale usted <eos> Fueron tantos los momentos que la amé <eos> Que siento sus caricias y su olor esta en mi piel <eos> Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mi <eos> La cubría de besos, y entre mil caricias <eos> La llevaba a la locura <eos> * CORO <eos> 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Let your heart be light <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be out of sight <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Make the Yuletide gay <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be miles away <eos> Once again as in olden days <eos> Happy golden days of yore <eos> Faithful friends who are dear to us <eos> Will be near to us once more <eos> Someday soon we all will be together <eos> If the fates allow <eos> Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow <eos> So have yourself a merry little Christmas now <eos> 
Had our share of the pain <eos> Of the clouds and the rain <eos> Lean on me and I’ll lean on you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> I know you’re scared ‘cause you can’t see the light <eos> You toss and turn through the night <eos> Holding me, and I’m holding you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> Where do you go when there’s no road to follow? <eos> Faces look hollow, only strangers to you now <eos> Where do you turn when this living starts to burn <eos> Through layers that you learned to wrap around your heart somehow? <eos> I turn to you <eos> I always do <eos> I turn to you <eos> I know you’re scared, can’t see the light <eos> Got to believe it’s gonna be alright <eos> Lean on me and I’ll lean on you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We’ll make it through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> 
Yo te di todo mi amor y más <eos> Y tu no reconoces ni lo que es amar <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Yo se que un día tu volverás <eos> Y tu de todo te arrepentirás <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos>

Dicen que hay peligro cuando salgo <eos> Que no le temo a lo malo (A veces soy candela) <eos> No te confundas que no soy nada de buena <eos> En mis ojos ves maldad <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos> Tráeme alcohol pa' que se moje la garganta <eos> Una como yo a ti te hace falta <eos> Calladita pero a veces soy mala <eos> Empiezo y no quiero parar <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos> Tráeme alcohol pa' que se moje la garganta <eos> Una como yo a ti te hace falta <eos> Calladita pero a veces soy mala <eos> Empiezo y no quiero parar <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos> Muevo el boom-boom como un sismo <eos> Par de trago' y entro en erotismo <eos> No digo na' pero quiero lo mismo <eos> Y cuando yo bailo así <eos> Me agarra la cintura <eos> Me sube la calentura <eos> Veo su cuerpo cómo suda <eos> Y eso que todavía <eos> No me ha visto desnuda en su cama <eos> Estoy pa' perder la cabeza <eos> No me hablen de amor <eos> Eso a mí no me interesa <eos> Te gusta el juego, yo soy la que empieza <eos> Pero recuerda que <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos> Tráeme alcohol pa' que se moje la garganta <eos> Una como yo a ti te hace falta <eos> Calladita pero a veces soy mala <eos> Empiezo y no quiero parar <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos> Quiero un shot de tequila <eos> Rumba hasta el otro día <eos> Soltera, así me quería <eos> Que yo daba fuego decían <eos> Y que esto no pare <eos> Que a penas comienza <eos> Apaguen celulare' <eos> Estamo' pa' maldade' <eos> Y que esto no pare <eos> Que a penas comienza <eos> Apaguen celulare' <eos> Estamo' pa' maldade' <eos> Santa <eos> Tráeme alcohol pa' que se moje la garganta <eos> Una como yo a ti te hace falta <eos> Calladita pero a veces soy mala <eos> Empiezo y no quiero parar <eos> No soy ni mala ni santa <eos>

Whoa, yeah <eos> Since I was born they couldn't hold me down <eos> Another misfit kid, another burned out of town <eos> I never played by the rules I never really cared <eos> My nasty reputation takes me everywhere <eos> I look and see it's not only me <eos> So many others have stood where I stand <eos> We are the young, so raise your hands <eos> They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial <eos> We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild <eos> We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all <eos> The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild <eos> Boss screaming in my ear about who I'm supposed to be <eos> "Get a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me." <eos> I said "Hey man, there's something that you ought to know <eos> I tell you Park Avenue leads to Skid Row." <eos> I look and see it's not only me <eos> We're standin' tall ain't never a doubt <eos> We are the young, so shout it out <eos> They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial <eos> We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild <eos> We stand and we won't fall, we're the one and one for all <eos> The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild <eos> We are the youth gone wild <eos> Well let me hear you get wild <eos> They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial <eos> We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild <eos> We stand and we won't fall, we're the one and one for all <eos> The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild <eos> Whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, we are the youth gone wild <eos> Whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, we are the youth gone wild <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah, we are the youth gone wild <eos> Whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, we are the youth gone wild <eos> 
Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> At the Christmas party hop <eos> Mistletoe hung where you can see <eos> Every couple tries to stop <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Let the Christmas spirit ring <eos> Later we'll have some pumpkin pie <eos> And we'll do some caroling <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing, "Let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with boughs of holly!" <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone's dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashioned way <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing, "Let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with boughs of holly!" <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone's dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashioned way <eos> 
Feel the rain <eos> Feel the rain <eos> It's cold, cloudy, windy, and wet <eos> I see the sun, inside my head <eos> It's warm there, and I need the warmth <eos> More than I ever have <eos> Do my eyes deceive me? <eos> Totally alone and yet surrounded <eos> "What is the plan, and what can I do?" <eos> To stop the rain from coming? <eos> It touches everything I love <eos> The rain touches everything I love <eos> Until it's all washed away <eos> And when that mean old levee <eos> Finally cracks and breaks <eos> You better learn to walk on water <eos> Or fly with broken wings <eos> It's cold, cloudy, windy, and wet <eos> The storm just rages inside my head <eos> It knows no end <eos> It just keeps on raining <eos> Senses trigger the brutal stings <eos> Of every possibility and memory <eos> And it just keeps on raining <eos> Down, down, down <eos> It touches everything we love <eos> The rain touches everything we love <eos> Until it's all washed away <eos> And when that mean old levee <eos> Finally cracks and breaks <eos> You better learn to walk on water <eos> Or fly with broken wings <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> Before it washes us away <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> Before it washes us away <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> Before it washes us away <eos> It can only rain for so long <eos> The levee's gonna break before long <eos> And I can only swim for so long <eos> So maybe it's our time to drown <eos> 
Hey, where did we go? <eos> Days when the rains came <eos> Down in the hollow <eos> Playin' a new game <eos> Laughing and a running, hey, hey <eos> Skipping and a jumping <eos> In the misty morning fog with <eos> Our hearts a thumpin' and you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Whatever happened <eos> To Tuesday and so slow? <eos> Going down the old mine <eos> With a transistor radio <eos> Standing in the sunlight laughing <eos> Hiding behind a rainbow's wall <eos> Slipping and sliding <eos> All along the waterfall, with you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Do you remember when we used to sing <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da <eos> Just like that <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> So hard to find my way <eos> Now that I'm all on my own <eos> I saw you just the other day <eos> My, how you have grown <eos> Cast my memory back there, Lord <eos> Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout <eos> Making love in the green grass <eos> Behind the stadium with you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Do you remember when we used to sing <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> 
To be young and in love in New York City <eos> To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me <eos> To be drunk and in love in New York City <eos> Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I don't know what it is but I got that feeling <eos> Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling <eos> If we lay, let the day just pass us by <eos> I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Lay here with me, ooh <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Yes I do, yes I do, babe) <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Oooh noo) <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> (I like me, I like me) <eos> (Look who you made me, made me, oh noo) <eos> Better when <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> 
Strangers in the night exchanging glances <eos> Wondering in the night, what were the chances? <eos> We'd be sharing love before the night was through <eos> Something in your eyes was so inviting <eos> Something in your smile was so exciting <eos> Something in my heart told me I must have you <eos> Strangers in the night <eos> Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night <eos> Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know <eos> Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and <eos> Ever since that night we've been together <eos> Lovers at first sight, in love forever <eos> It turned out so right for strangers in the night <eos> Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away <eos> Ever since that night we've been together <eos> Lovers at first sight, in love forever <eos> It turned out so right for strangers in the night <eos> Dooby-doooby-doo and other scat to end <eos> 
Para contarte, canto <eos> Quiero que sepas cuánto <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Te quiero de mil modos <eos> Te quiero sobre todo <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Basta ver el reflejo de tus ojos en los míos <eos> Como se lleva el frío, para entender <eos> Que el corazón no miente <eos> Que afortunadamente <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Para contarte, canto <eos> Quiero que sepas cuánto <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Basta ver el reflejo de tus ojos en los míos <eos> Como se lleva el frío <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> Me haces bien, me haces bien <eos> 
The A, the B, the A, the B, the C the (x8) <eos> The capital A, and we’d like to say the homeboys from around the way <eos> With another dope beat to drop, hip hop from around the block <eos> A.B.C MCs, pulling Gs rhymes and beats to knock down trees <eos> Top of the line, all the time now we're done with our rhyme sing one time <eos> We might be young, it doesn’t really matter <eos> Our beats and rhymes, will make you speak and shatter <eos> And then you’ll hear, us throughout the nation <eos> The hip hop boys, Another Bad Creation <eos> Hitting hard bass hits like thunder <eos> The singing skills like Stevie Wonder <eos> Smoothed out like style and sticks? <eos> Harmony backgrounds like Tay shick? <eos> Hard like leveling? Shaq Daddy <eos> Rhymes that flow like Big Daddy Kane <eos> Put it all together as you can see Another Bad Creation, A.B.C <eos> Get down with them Mark what’s the next though, rap <eos> Did babies other crew? Oh still getting down <eos> When it comes to us they try to hit, they’ll miss <eos> Like Ice Cube baby, you can’t fade this <eos> I’d like to shoot a shout out there to Dr. Freeze, Rico, Hallowy Kid?, the whole A.B.C. crew <eos> Peace <eos> About two years ago, about two or three <eos> I never picked up, the M-I-C <eos> And then rap got big and I knew it would <eos> Now I started this year and I’m just as good <eos> As those other rappers, who get all the credit <eos> But now I gotta rhyme and it’s more than copacetic <eos> Cuz I’m on TV and the New York Times <eos> And Guinness Book of Records for the most def rhymes <eos> The A, the B, the A, the B, the C the (x16) <eos> 
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> 
Some people live for the fortune <eos> Some people live just for the fame <eos> Some people live for the power, yeah <eos> Some people live just to play the game <eos> Some people think <eos> That the physical things <eos> Define what's within <eos> And I've been there before <eos> That life's a bore <eos> So full of the superficial <eos> Some people want it all <eos> But I don't want nothing at all <eos> If it ain't you, baby <eos> If I ain't got you, baby <eos> Some people want diamond rings <eos> Some just want everything <eos> But everything means nothing <eos> If I ain't got you, yeah <eos> Some people search for a fountain <eos> Promises forever young <eos> Some people need three dozen roses <eos> And that's the only way to prove you love them <eos> Hand me the world on a silver platter <eos> And what good would it be <eos> With no one to share <eos> With no one who truly cares for me <eos> Some people want it all <eos> But I don't want nothing at all <eos> If it ain't you, baby <eos> If I ain't got you, baby <eos> Some people want diamond rings <eos> Some just want everything <eos> But everything means nothing <eos> If I ain't got you, you, you <eos> Some people want it all <eos> But I don't want nothing at all <eos> If it ain't you, baby <eos> If I ain't got you, baby <eos> Some people want diamond rings <eos> Some just want everything <eos> But everything means nothing <eos> If I ain't got you, yeah <eos> If I ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh <eos> Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing <eos> If I ain't got you with me, baby <eos> 
Thanks for the times that you've given me <eos> The memories are all in my mind <eos> And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow <eos> There's something I must say out loud <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> You shared my dreams <eos> My joys <eos> My pains <eos> You made my life worth living for <eos> And if I had to live my life over again, dear <eos> I'd spend each and every moment with you <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> When we are together <eos> The moments I cherish <eos> With every beat of my heart <eos> To touch you <eos> To hold you <eos> To feel you <eos> To need you <eos> There's nothing to keep us apart <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> 
I call you when I need you <eos> When your heart's on fire <eos> You come to me, come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> You come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> Give me a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> Speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> It can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong, baby <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I've ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> Hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> In your heart I see the start <eos> Of every night and every day <eos> And in your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I've ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> Hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> Each time you leave me I start losing control <eos> You're walking away with my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel you even when I'm alone <eos> Oh, baby <eos> Oh oh, yeah <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I've ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> Hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> Oh, you're the best <eos> 
I looked to my arms <eos> And my legs <eos> And my head <eos> And my chest <eos> And I said that I'm okay <eos> No more thoughts of regret <eos> They're purely electrical signals <eos> So I might've flicked a switch <eos> Oh <eos> It's time to relax <eos> Have a snack and <eos> Walk to the river <eos> Noticed how it is bigger than all of this <eos> You were someone <eos> I met on the internet <eos> Not tonight <eos> You are real <eos> What a rush <eos> What a feel <eos> Take you out on a date <eos> And pretend that were making a ten point <eos> Series about our mistakes <eos> Time to relax <eos> Oh we're both kinda lightweight so <eos> We went for dinner <eos> Hanging with you is different to everything <eos> Wow <eos>

Christmas night, another fight <eos> Tears, we cried a flood <eos> Got all kinds of poison in <eos> Of poison in my blood <eos> I took my feet <eos> To Oxford Street <eos> Trying to right a wrong <eos> Just walk away <eos> Those windows say <eos> But I can't believe she's gone <eos> When you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Up above candles on air flicker <eos> Oh, they flicker and they float <eos> But I'm up here holding on <eos> To all those chandeliers of hope <eos> Like some drunken Elvis singing <eos> I go singing out of tune <eos> Saying how I always loved you darling <eos> And I always will <eos> Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Down where the sea and city meet <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Maybe they'll bring her back to me <eos> Then all my troubles will be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Oh, Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Light up the fireworks in me <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Those Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> 
Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> You came into my heart <eos> So tenderly <eos> With a burning love <eos> That stings like a bee <eos> Now that I surrender <eos> So helplessly <eos> You now wanna leave <eos> Ooh, you wanna leave me <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> Ooh, don't you want me? <eos> Don't you want me no more? <eos> Ooh, baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go <eos> And all your promises <eos> Of a love forever more <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> Before you won my heart <eos> You were a perfect guy <eos> But now that you got me <eos> You wanna leave me behind <eos> (Baby, baby) ooh baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> 
So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos>

Espérame <eos> Espérame cuando nadie me espera <eos> Regálame las flores que prefieras <eos> Que igual las voy aceptar <eos> No dudes que siento tu presencia <eos> Estando lejos <eos> Parece extraño pero <eos> Yo te tengo aquí muy adentro <eos> Y no importa cuando sale el sol <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> Reconocí cuando te vi <eos> Esa forma de dudar <eos> Sabiendo que no te gusta nadar <eos> Igual quiero saltar <eos> Un mar que se extiende <eos> Posibilidad <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> Un mar que se extiende <eos> Posibilidad <eos> Razones me sobran <eos> Si tu vas a estar <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos>

The first time the devil looked into my eyes <eos> I knew that he was out to get me <eos> There was no disguise <eos> He's always hiding behind <eos> Nunca me quedo en un solo sitio <eos> Te amaré pero solo visito, ah <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> The first time I heard the galaxy speak <eos> It was between you and me <eos> Now we both have to flee <eos> I can't ever stay in only one place <eos> But in the city of nightmares we both embrace <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> I'm in love with the universe <eos> Oh no, no, no, no, no <eos> Na na na na na na no <eos> Na na na na no <eos> I don't belong to anyone else <eos> 
Vuoto che lasci, voto che abbracci <eos> Vedrò l'ignoto che viene a cercarci <eos> Lobi del cuore divisi coi calci <eos> Noia repressa in un Arci <eos> Gente vegetale messa negli angoli <eos> In cattedrale la messa dei diavoli <eos> I più tristi, i più soli tracciano pentacoli <eos> Povere bestie marchiate nei pascoli <eos> Il monte si pettina di neve bianca <eos> Di neve bianca <eos> Torna ogni anno col freddo che avanza <eos> La merla canta <eos> Il decoro di merda non era abbastanza <eos> L'appariscenza è un'usanza <eos> Col polso facevo riparo <eos> Cadendo dall'albero di Sicomoro <eos> A forza di testate imparo <eos> A forza di grandi troie m'innamoro <eos> Con tutto che mi fidavo <eos> Ora so quel che ricavo da un lago <eos> Di pesci che han messo all'ingrasso <eos> E li peschi pure senza l'amo <eos> E sanno di farmaco <eos> Di quelli potenti che sedano un narvalo <eos> Atena <eos> Incurva la mia schiena <eos> Dona <eos> Alla mia stazza una fattezza anziana <eos> Battezzami <eos> Spirito, l'importante è porci tenaci <eos> Contro quei porci dei Proci <eos> Evito approcci feroci <eos> Penelope <eos> Temevo che fossi tradito <eos> Dai fili mossi dal dito <eos> Dei figli tuoi e di tuo marito: <eos> Ardito <eos> Avere fede in un'assenza <eos> La luna intona lode alla Pazienza <eos>

Hey <eos> This is a story I hate <eos> And tellin' it might make me break <eos> But I'll tell it anyway <eos> This chapter's about <eos> How you said there was nobody else <eos> Then you got up and went to her house <eos> You guys always left me out <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart? <eos> You check in and out <eos> Of my heart like a hotel <eos> And she must be perfect, oh well <eos> I hope you both go to hell <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart?

You see that mountain over there? Yeah? <eos> Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn <eos> Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man <eos> Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend <eos> Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats <eos> Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats <eos> Play some back-home, come-on music <eos> That comes from the heart <eos> Play something with lots of feeling <eos> Because that's where music has to start <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos>

Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!) <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> That's the way every day goes <eos> Every time we've no control <eos> If the sky is pink and white <eos> If the ground is black and yellow <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Nod my head, don't close my eyes <eos> Halfway on a slow move <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> If you could fly, then you'd feel south <eos> Up north's getting cold soon <eos> The way it is, we're on land <eos> Still I'm someone to hold true <eos> Keep you cool when it's still alive <eos> Won't let you down when it's all ruin <eos> Just the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> In the wake of a hurricane <eos> Dark skin of a summer shade <eos> Nosedive into flood lines <eos> Tall tower of milk crates <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Cannonball off the porch side <eos> Older kids trying off the roof <eos> Just the same way you showed me (You showed) <eos> If you could die and come back to life <eos> Up for air from the swimming pool <eos> You'd kneel down to the dry land <eos> Kiss the Earth that birthed you <eos> Gave you tools just to stay alive <eos> And make it out when the sun is ruined <eos> That's the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> Remember life, remember how it was <eos> Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here <eos> Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob <eos> Say what up to Danny <eos> Say what up to life immortality <eos> Bending up my Nikes <eos> Running out the melpomene, nicotine <eos> Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy) <eos> Gimme something sweet <eos> Bitch, I might like immortality <eos> This is life, life immortality <eos> 
Tell me something, give me hope for the night <eos> We don't know how we feel <eos> We're just praying that we're doing this right <eos> Though that's not the way it seems <eos> Summer gone, now winter's on its way <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> Oh, I'll miss the days we had <eos> Loving, leaving, it's too late for this now <eos> Such esteem for each has gone <eos> Has time driven our season away? <eos> Cause that's the way it seems <eos> In the world of the speech that is new <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> 
Letra de «Acá con Vos» <eos> Cada cuento detallado <eos> Despacio y de colores <eos> Como pinceladas <eos> Cada abrazo es una excusa <eos> Quedamos en un puente <eos> Como suspendidos <eos> De nuevo, aunque pase el tiempo <eos> Vuelvo a enamorarme de este viaje entre los dos <eos> A veces, puede parecerte <eos> Que ando en otro lado <eos> Pero estoy acá con vos <eos> Se destiñen los rojizos <eos> Pero reinventados <eos> Tienen nuevo brillo <eos> Y la voz quedó distinta <eos> De a poco atravesada <eos> Por el recorrido <eos> Van llegando nuevas estaciones <eos> Van creciendo tantas ilusiones <eos> Acá con vos <eos> 
I wanna steal every breath of fire <eos> From every star in the Southern sky <eos> I wanna lay down in the dark <eos> And take a match right to your heart <eos> I wanna hide with you in the rain <eos> In the eye of a hurricane <eos> I wanna call it for what it is <eos> And give you everything I've got to give <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Keep me locked up in your eyes <eos> Before the sun pushes out the night <eos> Before we're whispers in the air <eos> Come on and take me without a care <eos> I wanna know what it feels like <eos> To disappear into you and <eos> Never have to say goodbye <eos> I wanna call love what it is <eos> And give you everything I've got to give <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Don't wanna go yet, Romeo + Juliet <eos> Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset <eos> Ooh baby, drivin' me crazy <eos> Windows up, prayin' God don't save me <eos> Don't wanna go yet, Romeo + Juliet <eos> Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset <eos> Ooh baby drivin' me crazy <eos> Windows up, prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos>

In this room I'm sitting by your side <eos> 'Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook <eos> Standing on the edge <eos> Casting lots to set me up before you knock me down <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> You let it go and then you fold <eos> So we stay on the open road <eos> We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all <eos> Driving in your car, miss the stop sign, fall in love, just to get knocked out <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes <eos> Pulled like a punch and burnt like a cigarette? <eos> Forever <eos>

¿Qué está pasando? Se escucha en los radios <eos> Nos vienen siguiendo, parece que son contrarios <eos> Son varias trocas pero le atoramos <eos> Venimos mi compa y yo pero traemos buen callo <eos> Le puse al cuerno un cargador alargado <eos> Me eché un padre nuestro y casi me suspiré un gramo <eos> Por el espejo miré que se acercaron <eos> Tiraron varias balas, pero ninguna pegaron <eos> En ese momento, la neta, hasta me dio risa <eos> Ya sabían que no era ensayo <eos> Por el quemacocos salí tirando vergazos <eos> Traqueteaba el cuerno y en el vidrio les pegaron <eos> Ya mate a una, nada más me faltan cuatro <eos> Pisamos tierrita y ahí fue donde le fallamos <eos> Mi compa, bien loco, no controló bien el carro <eos> Y en una zanjita, fue donde nos estrellamos <eos> Traspasaban balas, se me borró la sonrisa <eos> Y hasta se me fue la vida <eos> Seguí echando guerra pero se me adelantaron <eos> Traía la pechera pero me la atravesaron <eos> Cuando abrí la puerta para bajarme del carro <eos> Mi sangre entre plomo y aún así le seguí dando <eos> Ahora sí en el cielo pido perdón por mis actos <eos> Me voy de esta vida pero no se irán intactos <eos> Tanta adrenalina, ya no sentía los putazos <eos> Bien Tony Montana por el pase que me ha dado <eos> Cuando menos pensé, no me respondían los brazos <eos> Caí al piso débil, la neta, estaba llorando <eos> Descansa mi cuerpo ya tirado <eos> Pa'l infierno a donde vamos <eos> Streetmob <eos> Rancho Humilde <eos> Lumbre Music <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos>

I took my love, I took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain <eos> And I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart <eos> Rise above? <eos> Can I sail through <eos> The changing ocean tides <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Oooooooh Ooooooooh <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder <eos> Even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makеs you bolder <eos> Even children gеt older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> So take my love, take it down <eos> Climbed a mountain <eos> And turned around <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> The landslide will bring you down <eos> 
Ô la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Hum la belle vie <eos> On est seul <eos> On est libre <eos> Et l'on s'aime <eos> On s'amuse à passer avec tous ses copains <eos> Des nuits blanches <eos> Qui se penchent <eos> Sur les petits matins <eos> Mais la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Oui la belle vie <eos> On s'enlace <eos> On est triste <eos> Et l'on traîne <eos> Alors pense que moi je t'aime <eos> Et quand tu auras compris <eos> Réveille-toi <eos> Je serai là <eos> Pour toi <eos>

I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire <eos> You come to me, come to me, wild and wild <eos> When you come to me, give me everything I need <eos> Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams <eos> Speak the language of love like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong, baby <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone, anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart? No, no! <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> In your heart I see the start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone, anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart?

Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> 
Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos> 
City of stars <eos> Are you shining just for me? <eos> City of stars <eos> There's so much that I can't see <eos> Who knows? <eos> I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you <eos> That now our dreams <eos> They've finally come true <eos> City of stars <eos> Just one thing everybody wants <eos> There in the bars <eos> And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants <eos> It's love <eos> Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else <eos> A rush <eos> A glance <eos> A touch <eos> A dance <eos> A look in somebody's eyes <eos> To light up the skies <eos> To open the world and send me reeling <eos> A look that says, I'll be here <eos> And you'll be alright <eos> 'Cause I don't care if I know <eos> Just where I will go <eos> 'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling <eos> A rat-tat-tat in my heart <eos> I Think I want it to stay <eos> City of stars <eos> Are you shining just for me? <eos> City of stars <eos> You never shined so brightly <eos> 
You and me <eos> We come from different worlds <eos> You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls <eos> Sometimes you're crazy <eos> And you wonder why <eos> I'm such a baby 'cause the Dolphins make me cry <eos> Well there's nothing I can do <eos> I've been looking for a girl like you <eos> You look at me <eos> You've got nothing left to say <eos> I'll only pout at you until I get my way <eos> I won't dance <eos> You won't sing <eos> I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring <eos> Well there's nothing I can do <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> You can call me your fool <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> Put on a little Dylan <eos> Sitting on a fence <eos> I say that line is great <eos> You ask me what it meant by <eos> Said I shot a man named Gray <eos> Took his wife to Italy <eos> She inherited a million bucks <eos> And when she died it came to me <eos> I can't help it if I'm lucky <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> Ain't Bobby so cool <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> Yeah I'm tangled up in blue <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> You can call me your fool <eos> Only wanna be with you <eos> Sometimes I wonder if it will ever end <eos> You get so mad at me <eos> When I go out with my friends <eos> Sometimes you're crazy <eos> And you wonder why <eos> I'm such a baby, yeah <eos> The Dolphins make me cry <eos> Well there's nothing I can do <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> You can call me your fool <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> Yeah I'm tangled up in blue <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos> I only wanna be with you <eos>

We get some rules to follow <eos> That and this, these and those <eos> No one knows <eos> We get these pills to swallow <eos> How they stick in your throat <eos> Tastes like gold <eos> Oh, what you do to me <eos> No one knows <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> I journey through the desert <eos> Of the mind with no hope <eos> I follow <eos> I drift along the ocean <eos> Dead lifeboat in the sun <eos> End come undone <eos> Pleasantly caving in <eos> I come undone <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> Heaven smiles above me <eos> What a gift here below <eos> But no one knows <eos> A gift that you give to me <eos> No one knows <eos> Ustedes que son padres de familia... <eos> …Buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el <eos> "DJ Héctor Bonifacio Echevarría Cervantes de la Cruz Arroyo Rojas" <eos> Esta es la radio Quetzalcoatl <eos> Estación donde el rock vive y no muere <eos> Vamos a escuchar un par de temas de Queens of the Stone Age <eos> Primero vamos a escuchar "First It Giveth..." <eos> ...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… <eos>

Hold myself to a chord <eos> Waiting for the day that you come back to me <eos> You know that I don’t give a fuck about appearances <eos> Been hearing things about you <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> Move in step across the floor <eos> Waiting here to say that you can’t handle me <eos> You know I never understood why you would say these things <eos> I don’t feel the same without you <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> 
There's a land that I have heard about <eos> So far across the sea (repeat) <eos> To have you all, my dreamland <eos> Would be like heaven to me (repeat) <eos> We'll get our breakfast from the tree <eos> We'll get our honey from the bees <eos> We'll take a ride on the waterfalls <eos> And all the glories, we'll have them all <eos> And we'll live together on that dreamland <eos> And have so much fun (repeat) <eos> Oh, what a time that will be <eos> Oh yes, we'll wait, wait, wait and see <eos> We'll count the stars up in the sky... <eos> ...And surely we'll never die <eos> 
I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight <eos> And all that you mean to me <eos> I used to think I would never fall in love again <eos> I guess I was wrong <eos> When your heart is broken <eos> When your wounded pride is laid to rest, baby <eos> You'll never open your heart to anyone else you say <eos> But you lie, I know you're lyin', baby <eos> You see your mind might be made up, mmm <eos> But your heart has got it's own plans <eos> There's no one to blame for false pride, tellin' lies <eos> Tryin' to hide from feelin' the pain <eos> I know you don't wanna feel it <eos> There's nowhere to hide <eos> When the love is callin' your name in from the dark <eos> Nowhere to hide, baby, yeah <eos> There's nowhere to hide <eos> So let love have it's way, with your heart <eos> When love calls, love calls, love calls your name <eos> It's on my lips <eos> And I wish that you were still here <eos> To take me away with your kiss <eos> And take me away from all this crazy, crazy <eos> 'Cause too many words have been spoken, mmm <eos> Too many lies have been told, baby <eos> You'll never do it again you tell  yourself <eos> Over, and over, and over <eos> You're wrong, dead wrong, babe, yeah <eos> There's nowhere to hide, mmm <eos> When love is callin' your name in from the dark, baby <eos> Nowhere to run, girl <eos> There's nowhere to hide, yeah <eos> So let love have its way, girl, with your heart, babe <eos> Love calls, love calls <eos> There's nowhere to hide, yeah <eos> When love is calls your name you fall apart, baby <eos> Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run when love is <eos> On its way, girl, to your heart, baby <eos> When love calls, love calls your name, babe <eos> Love's callin' your name, hey, hey <eos> It's callin' out for you, callin' out for me, baby <eos> Love's on its way, baby, ay-ee, ay, ay, ay <eos> Now, I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you <eos> I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight <eos> And how you make me feel <eos> The sweetness of your touch <eos> The softness of your voice, mmm <eos> You make me wanna be a better man, baby <eos> And I wanna thank you for calling me into your life <eos> Into your arms, into your love <eos> 
You said that I drank too much <eos> The tattoos on my skin are not your style <eos> You didn't like cigarettes on my kiss <eos> Well I hope that's something you miss <eos> Cause I'm not slowing down for awhile <eos> I've been desperate to fix what we've been <eos> Somethings need to stay broken <eos> Realize you're not worth me trying to hide <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> Want you so bad that I couldn't see <eos> The truth was sitting there in front of me <eos> It's never love, it was never real <eos> You wanted something to fix not something to feel <eos> But I am not your accessory <eos> I am not a Marie Annette for your passenger seat <eos> A lesson learned and now I'm free <eos> Well your green eyes look like shit to me <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> So won't you go on and marry that lady <eos> Wears Louis Vuitton, drives around in her Mercedes <eos> Says, "Downtown Dallas is the place to be" <eos> Daddy gave her everything that she's got for free <eos> She looks real good with her head down low <eos> Always minds her business in your shadow <eos> Kisses your ass like you wanted me to <eos> Well good luck honey he's all for you <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos>

Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding <eos> Do you even care, if I die bleeding? <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplatin' suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> I never realized I was spread too thin <eos> 'Til it was too late and I was empty within <eos> Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin <eos> Downward spiral, where do I begin? <eos> It all started when I lost my mother <eos> No love for myself and no love for another <eos> Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level <eos> Findin' nothin' but questions and devils <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplating suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Can't go on living this way <eos> Nothing's alright <eos> 
I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> 
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye <eos> I saw a pretty little thing approaching me <eos> She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone <eos> Oh, could you use a little company? <eos> If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice <eos> And you can go and send me on my way." <eos> I said, "You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?" <eos> She looked at me and this is what she said: <eos> "Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back <eos> Though you know, I wish I could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good" <eos> Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street <eos> When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight <eos> And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head <eos> He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight <eos> He said, "Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life <eos> But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice." <eos> I told him, "You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask <eos> What made you want to live this kind of life?" <eos> He said, "There ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back <eos> Though you know, I wish I could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good" <eos> Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house <eos> The day was winding down and coming to an end <eos> And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news <eos> And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend <eos> I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church <eos> He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills <eos> But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same <eos> Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills <eos> You know there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back <eos> Though you know we wish we could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good <eos> 
'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony that's life <eos> Trying to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die <eos> I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down <eos> You know the one that takes you to the places <eos> Where all the veins meet, yeah <eos> No change, I can change <eos> I can change, I can change <eos> But I'm here in my mould <eos> I am here in my mould <eos> But I'm a million different people from one day to the next <eos> I can't change my mould <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> (Have you ever been down?) <eos> Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah <eos> I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah <eos> I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now <eos> But the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing to me now <eos> No change, I can change <eos> I can change, I can change <eos> But I'm here in my mould <eos> I am here in my mould <eos> And I'm a million different people from one day to the next <eos> I can't change my mould <eos> No, no, no, no, no <eos> Have you ever been down? <eos> I can't change it you know, I can't change it <eos> 'Cause it's a bitter sweet symphony, that's life <eos> Trying to make ends meet <eos> Trying to find somebody, then you die <eos> I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down <eos> You know the one that takes you to the places <eos> Where all the veins meet, yeah <eos> You know I can change, I can change <eos> I can change, I can change <eos> But I'm here in my mould <eos> I am here in my mould <eos> And I'm a million different people from one day to the next <eos> I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no <eos> I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no <eos> I can't change my mould, no, no, no, no, no <eos> You've gotta change my mould, no, no, no <eos> (It's just sex and violence, melody and silence) <eos> (Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence) <eos> (Gotta can't change my violence, melody and silence) <eos> (I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down) <eos> (Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence) <eos> (I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down) <eos> (Gotta, can't change my violence, melody and silence) <eos> Been down <eos> Ever been down <eos> (Can't change my violence, melody and silence) <eos> Ever been down <eos> Ever been down <eos> Ever been down <eos> Have you ever been down? <eos> Have you ever been down? <eos> Have you ever been down? <eos>
