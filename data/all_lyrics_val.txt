I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own bedsheets <eos> I've been waking up alone, I haven't thought of her for days <eos> I'll be honest, it's better off this way <eos> But every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been tryin' but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remembеr you're gone, baby, it's just the song on thе radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own white tee <eos> I've been waking up alone <eos> I haven't thought of him for days <eos> I'll be honest <eos> It's better off this way <eos> Every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> And I've been trying but I just can't fight it (Ooh) <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling (Ooh) <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> 
I don't love her <eos> I tried to tell myself <eos> But you can see it in my eyes <eos> So don't deny <eos> I can't fool no one else <eos> The truth is in the tears I cry <eos> 'Cause... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> I told her I'd never fall in love <eos> But now I know better <eos> How does it feel <eos> I can't describe this feeling <eos> That came when I saw her last night <eos> She got to me <eos> I'll let you know the reason <eos> I saw her with another guy <eos> So... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> And if it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Maybe she'll take me back <eos> (Hey, girl, he's begging) <eos> I made a big mistake <eos> (Won't you forgive him, girl) <eos> Now I can feel it <eos> (He's never felt before) <eos> I really love her <eos> (You love her?!?! What?!?!) <eos> It took my heart <eos> To shatter in a thousand pieces <eos> Before I'd ever drop my pride <eos> (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <eos> Losing love worrying about my image <eos> Really helped me realize <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (On my mind all the time) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (She stays on my mind, mind, mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't, I can't describe this feeling that I feel for her) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (Stay on my mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos>

Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea <eos> To the open arms of the sea <eos> Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me <eos> I'll be coming home, wait for me" <eos> Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered, hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> 
How many days did I spend thinking <eos> 'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong? <eos> Lived in the shade you were throwing <eos> 'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone <eos> And I couldn't get away from ya <eos> In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah <eos> Your name on my lips, tongue-tied <eos> Free rent, living in my mind <eos> But then something happened one magical night <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> I forgot that you <eos> Got out some popcorn <eos> As soon as my rep started going down, down, down <eos> Laughed on the school yard <eos> As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground <eos> And I would've stuck around for ya <eos> Would've fought the whole town, so yeah <eos> Would've been right there, front row <eos> Even if nobody came to your show <eos> But you showed who you are, then one magical night <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> I forgot that you <eos> Sent me a clear message <eos> Taught me some hard lessons <eos> I just forget what they were <eos> It's all just a blur <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> I did, I did, I did <eos> It isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> So, yeah <eos> 
Some folks are born made to wave the flag <eos> Ooh, they're red, white and blue <eos> And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief" <eos> Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no senator's son, son <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Some folks are born silver spoon in hand <eos> Lord, don't they help themselves, no <eos> But when the taxman come' to the door <eos> Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no millionaire's son, no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes <eos> Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord <eos> And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?" <eos> Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!" <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no military son, son, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, one <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate son, no no no <eos> 
No puede haber <eos> Dónde la encontraría <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> No puede haber, desgracia semejante <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> Con iguales emociones, con las expresiones <eos> Que en otra sonrisa no vería yo <eos> Con esa mirada atenta a mi indiferencia <eos> Cuando me salía de la situación <eos> Con la misma fantasía, la capacidad <eos> De aguantar el ritmo despiadado oh oh <eos> De mi mal humor, oh oh oh oh <eos> Y me faltan cada noche todas tus manías <eos> Aunque más enormes, eran así las mías <eos> Y me faltan tus miradas porque sé que están allí <eos> Donde yo las puse apasionadas, oh, oh <eos> Justo sobre tí oh oh oh oh <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que, aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más evidente <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más preocupante <eos>

It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Stuck here <eos> Stuck here in these waters <eos> So sick to my stomach <eos> Is anybody there? <eos> Red lights <eos> Red lights in the darkness <eos> Everyone's so heartless <eos> Does anybody care? <eos> It's so hard to explain <eos> With your heart in a cage <eos> Only whisper but you wanna shout <eos> 'Cause the second you wake <eos> Too much pressure to take <eos> Every part of you wants to cry out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> Mirror <eos> Mirror on the wall <eos> I don't see beautiful <eos> Staring back at me <eos> Watching <eos> Watching my heart bleed out <eos> Trying not to freak out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for all of us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> They don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> They don't know <eos> 
Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby left this town <eos> Sunshining all day long <eos> But the rain keep coming down <eos> She's my life I need her so <eos> Why she left I just don't know <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since I set right down and cried <eos> Keep raining all the time <eos> But the river is running dry <eos> Lord help me it just isn't right <eos> I love that girl with all-a my might <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby broke my heart <eos> Searching for her in a while <eos> Like a blind man in the dark <eos> Love can make a poor man rich <eos> Or break his heart I don't know which <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Like a ship out on the sea <eos> Praying for her each night <eos> That she would come back-a home to me <eos> Life is love and love is right <eos> I hope she come back home tonight <eos> 
There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos>

All the time I’ve had to grow <eos> From the valleys, left alone <eos> Said I had to let you go <eos> To read the writing on the wall <eos> Born and raised in <eos> California <eos> Skies were blue <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> Lost in every place I go <eos> But leaving footprints on the road <eos> Won’t be long before you know <eos> Nothing matters anymore <eos> Born and raisеd in <eos> California <eos> Skies were bluе <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos>

A clown will hide his mask… in the closet till the next trick to come <eos> As a sea of  lust… burning deep inside <eos> Red lights and broken glass <eos> In the corner of a dead end street <eos> The cars, they pass me by <eos> As the people stare in silence on the screen <eos> So hold it, until its light <eos> Too much salt will kill every organ alive <eos> Until nothing lives here, "healthy sadness" as a must <eos> A new wave  of hope, carry me… blind my eyes <eos> Three they were laid upon me, through thеir eyes I see the loss <eos> Onе, lion heart, embraced my weakness with force <eos> The second was too weak to answer, he stared at me and cried <eos> He took my hand behind my back, and waved goodbye <eos> Still hold it… until the light, let the wind blow on my face <eos> Nowhere to hide <eos> Till the light will take me <eos> As years gone by <eos> No daylight in these dead end streets <eos> Those streets of mine <eos> Third, came into my head, whispered my soul those dead lines <eos> "bonded are we" he whispered in my ear, I was too weak even to cry <eos> As "third" marked his name upon me, close to take his stand <eos> "one" took off the fight     illuminate the night <eos> And kicked "Third" off me to death <eos> Why, tell me why, I know the storm is here and the desert will not stay dry <eos> (with tears I) cry, tell me why, I know the storm is here and the desert will not stay dry <eos> Red lights and broken glass <eos> In the corner of a dead end street <eos> The cars, they pass me by <eos> As the people staring silent <eos>

I hear the calling from beyond <eos> I feel the circle closing <eos> I taste the blood of human <eos> I give your life a reason <eos> The snake that coils your soul <eos> Burned we stand, ground covered with ashes <eos> Crematory dust <eos> Clouds fill the sky <eos> No birds sing tonight <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – calls you in <eos> Burned I stand, covered in blood <eos> Clouds darken my soul <eos> Drowning in blood <eos> Deafening howls, the sky is red tonight <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos> I hear the calling from beyond <eos> I feel the circle closing <eos> I taste the blood of human <eos> I give your life a reason <eos> The snake that coils your soul <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – calls you in <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – into twilight sleep <eos> They shall bring death <eos> Glory unto them <eos> Feast on ash and blood <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos> 
Where I come from isn't all that great <eos> My automobile is a piece of crap <eos> My fashion sense is a little whack <eos> And my friends are just as screwed as me <eos> I didn't go to boarding schools <eos> Preppy girls never looked at me <eos> Why should they? I ain't nobody <eos> Got nothing in my pocket <eos> Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> Look at all those movie stars <eos> They're all so beautiful and clean <eos> When the housemaids scrub the floors <eos> They get the spaces in between <eos> I wanna live a life like that <eos> I wanna be just like a king <eos> Take my picture by the pool <eos> Cause I'm the next big thing <eos> Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> The truth is <eos> I don't stand a chance <eos> It's something that you're born into <eos> And I just don't belong <eos> No I don't, I'm just a no class, beat down fool <eos> And I will always be that way <eos> I might as well enjoy my life <eos> And watch the stars play <eos> Beverly Hills, that's where I want to be <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills, rollin' like a celebrity <eos> (Gimme gimme, gimme gimme) <eos> Livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills <eos> Beverly Hills, livin' in Beverly Hills <eos> 
Now and then I think of when we were together <eos> Like when you said you felt so happy you could die <eos> I told myself that you were right for me <eos> But felt so lonely in your company <eos> But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember <eos> You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness <eos> Like resignation to the end, always the end <eos> So when we found that we could not make sense <eos> Well, you said that we would still be friends <eos> But I'll admit that I was glad it was over <eos> But you didn't have to cut me off <eos> Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing <eos> And I don't even need your love <eos> But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough <eos> No, you didn't have to stoop so low <eos> Have your friends collect your records and then change your number <eos> I guess that I don't need that though <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over <eos> But had me believing it was always something that I'd done <eos> But I don't wanna live that way <eos> Reading into every word you say <eos> You said that you could let it go <eos> And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know <eos> But you didn't have to cut me off <eos> Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh) <eos> And I don't even need your love (Oooh) <eos> But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh) <eos> No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh) <eos> Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh) <eos> I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh) <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Somebody (I used to know) <eos> Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) <eos> Somebody (I used to know) <eos> Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) <eos> (I used to know) <eos> (That I used to know) <eos> (I used to know) <eos> Somebody <eos> 
You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos> 
Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep <eos> And showed me how this town can shatter dreams <eos> Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon <eos> And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet <eos> Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> Ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives <eos> Painful scars are all that's left of me <eos> Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel <eos> If I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave <eos> And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> 
I don't wanna seem the way I do <eos> But I'm confident when I'm with you <eos> Lately, all I feel is bad and bruised <eos> Tired of tripping on my shoes <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like I'm floating when he calls me pretty <eos> I feel like somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> When I start to tumble from the sky <eos> You remind me how to fly <eos> Lately I've been feeling not alive <eos> But you bring me back to life <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like somebody whеn he calls me pretty <eos> I feel lifе somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like somebody when he calls me pretty <eos> I feel like somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> 
No hace falta que me quites la mirada <eos> Para que entienda que ya no queda nada <eos> Aquella luna que antes nos bailaba <eos> Se ha cansado y ahora nos da la espalda <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> Tengo contados todos los besos que nos damos <eos> Y tú fugitiva, andas perdida en otro lado <eos> Yo no quiero caricias de otros labios <eos> No quiero tus manos en otras manos <eos> Porque yo quiero que volvamos a intentarlo <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> (Donde esta el amor) <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> 
Hallé una flor un día en el camino <eos> Que apareció marchita y deshojada <eos> Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro <eos> Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla <eos> Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos <eos> A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma <eos> Recuperó el color que había perdido <eos> Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que nadie le robe el color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas <eos> Nació el amor que un día se había perdido <eos> Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra <eos> Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que siempre este cerca de mí <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Le fui brindando cariño, un poquito de amor <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Y en el invierno llenó mi jardín de color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Ay, cuando la vi, me enamoré y me la llevé, me la llevé <eos> ¡Avemaría! <eos> ¡Puerto Rico! <eos> Jajaja <eos> ¡Ataca, Sergio <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> ¡Esto sigue! <eos> 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner <eos> Sometimes I feel like my only friend <eos> Is the city I live in, The City of Angels <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion <eos> I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am <eos> She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy <eos> Well, I never worry, now that is a lie <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love, take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there <eos> It's hard to believe that I'm all alone <eos> At least I have her love <eos> The city, she loves me <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah <eos> Love me, I say, yeah yeah <eos> One time <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Is where I drew some blood <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I could not get enough <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Forgot about my love <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I gave my life away, yeah <eos> Yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah <eos> Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah <eos> Here I stay <eos> 
Whoo um, yeah <eos> Life is like a road that you travel on <eos> When there is one day here and the next day gone <eos> Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand <eos> Sometimes you turn your back to the wind <eos> There is a world outside every darkened door <eos> Where blues will not haunt you anymore <eos> Where brave are free and lovers soar <eos> Come ride with me to the distant shore <eos> We won't hesitate <eos> To break down the garden gate <eos> There's not much time left today, yeah <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you are going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> Through all these cities and all these towns <eos> It's in my blood and it is all around <eos> I love you now like I loved you then <eos> This is the road and these are the hands <eos> From Mozambique to those Memphis nights <eos> The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights <eos> Knock me down get back up again <eos> You are in my blood <eos> I am not a lonely man <eos> There is no load I cannot hold <eos> Road so rough this I know <eos> I will be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell them we are survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long, ooh! <eos> If you are going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (All night long) <eos> A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long, mmm yeah <eos> If you are going my way (You are going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long (All night long) <eos> There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I) <eos> A misunderstanding once <eos> But now we look it in the eyes <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> There ain't no load that I can't hold <eos> The roads are rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell them we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (All night long, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah) <eos> Life is a highway (Life is a highway) <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Wooh, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way (Going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long (Ooh, yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, I want to ride it all night long, babe) <eos> If you're going my way (You going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> 
I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos> 
Someday at Christmas <eos> Men won't be boys <eos> Playing with balms like kids play with toys <eos> One warm December <eos> Our hearts will see <eos> A world where men are free <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no wars <eos> When we have learned <eos> What Christmas is for <eos> When we have found <eos> What life's really worth <eos> They'll be peace on Earth <eos> Someday all are dreams will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> We'll see a land <eos> With no hungry children <eos> And no empty hands <eos> One happy morning <eos> Where people will share <eos> A world where people care <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no tears <eos> All men are equal <eos> And no men have no fears <eos> One shinning moment <eos> One prayer away from our world today <eos> Well someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Oh someday at Christmas <eos> Men will not fail <eos> Hate will be gone and love will prevail <eos> Someday a new world we can start <eos> With hope in every heart <eos> Someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where all men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time oh <eos> But someday oh at Christmas time woo <eos> 
Que podre decirte <eos> En el corto tiempo <eos> En que se vive una ilusion <eos> Que podre dejarte <eos> Tan pegado al alma <eos> Que se quede ahi en tu corazon <eos> Yo no pretendo enseñarte <eos> Lo que es el mundo me falta tambien <eos> Pero vale la pena disfrutar cada dia <eos> Porque me has regalado el privilegio de amarte <eos> Di lo que sientas <eos> Has lo que piensas <eos> Da lo que tengas <eos> Y no te arrepientas <eos> Y si no llega lo que esperabas <eos> No te conformes jamas te detengas <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas nunca te olvides de Dios <eos> Seras del tamaño <eos> De tus pensamientos <eos> No te permitas fracasar <eos> Lo mas importante <eos> Son los sentimientos y lo que no puedes comprar <eos> Y cuando llegue el momento <eos> En que tu sola quisieras volar <eos> Aunque no estemos juntos <eos> Estaran los recuerdos que con solo quererlo <eos> Volveras a vivirlos <eos> Di lo que sientas has lo que piensas <eos> Da lo que tengas y no te arrepientas <eos> No te limites por lo que digan <eos> Se lo que quieras pero se tu misma <eos> Y si no llega lo que esperabas <eos> No te conformes jamas te detengas <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas nunca te olvides de dios <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas como te quiero: <eos> Mi amor... <eos>

Yeah <eos> I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze <eos> I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway <eos> Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase <eos> I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah <eos> I battle with depression, but the question still remains <eos> Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage? <eos> And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase <eos> Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day <eos> And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze <eos> Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace <eos> I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace <eos> How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case? <eos> Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste <eos> Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take <eos> But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage <eos> Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention <eos> I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing <eos> And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine <eos> Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave <eos> I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again <eos> Crashed my car just to feel again <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah <eos> Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh <eos> We're sick and tired of wondering <eos> Praying to a god that you don't believe <eos> You're searching for the truth in the lost and found <eos> So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now? <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos>

Y una bolsita para dar el levantón <eos> Y un botecito que me quema con frío <eos> Tres, cuatro barbies bien preciosas pa' bailar <eos> El solecito a lo lejos veo pasar <eos> Me pasa mi compa un tabaco pa' enbaisar <eos> El corazón siento me empieza a palpitar <eos> Llevaba tiempo sin eso experimentar <eos> No sé que es eso creo dicen mariposas <eos> Llevo un buen rato y no la dejo de mirar <eos> Labios hermosos su rostro espectacular <eos> Me acerco y la neta no sé si saludar <eos> Pero no es malo mejor me voy a aventar <eos> Que hermosa niña créanme que fue la verdad <eos> Toqué su hombro y al instante me mira <eos> Su mano pega y me lleva junto a bailar <eos> Me tenía loco la forma de su mirar <eos> Y al paso en que ella se me pega y me pone a bailar <eos> Su cuerpo pegadito al mío me hace ya vibrar <eos> Tengo yo miedo y no me quiero enamorar <eos> Pero ya es tarde y créanme que esto me gusta <eos> Dos, tres canciones y no para de bailar <eos> No me interesa mientras este junto a ella <eos> Tres, cuatro tragos y la fiesta mejora <eos> Nos conocimos mientras la rola suena <eos> Ya ni les cuento ya saben lo que pasó <eos> Rodó en mi cama y justo cuando el Sol salió <eos> Dormimos juntos me tenía bien loco <eos> Y aquí termina la historia de este cuento <eos> Aquí sigo en el antro fumando un gallo <eos> Siempre observando por si es que me la topo <eos> Pasan los días y no la he vuelto a mirar <eos> A Dios le rezo pa' que la haga ya llegar <eos> Cierro los ojos y me acuerdo de su carita <eos> Como bailaba sonreía y de ese mirar <eos> Luna dile tú que a ella la puedes mirar <eos> Dile que vuelva y aquí la voy a esperar <eos>

I drank a liter of tequila in my bedroom <eos> It's takin' every ounce of power not to text you <eos> Your body frozen in my mind like a statue <eos> Wish I could scratch off all the letters of our tattoo <eos> I'm a believer, but I keep learnin' the hard way <eos> That ya love's only gonna make my heart break <eos> While I was crying, you were flying at a party <eos> Baby, you play me, like Atari at an arcade <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't dеserve me <eos> I caught you lying with thе Bible in your right hand <eos> Thought you could rule me like I wasn't gonna bite back <eos> I'm sick of manipulative venomous spending all of my time <eos> Second-guessing my mind, keep on taking the high road <eos> But I'm ready to go low, so <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> I was buried alive <eos> But I learned to hold my breath <eos> No, you won't fool me twice <eos> You can't have this back <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> 
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee <eos> We don't take no trips on LSD; <eos> We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street <eos> But, We love living right, and being free <eos> We don't make a party out of loving <eos> But we like holding hands and pitching woo; <eos> We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy <eos> Like the hippies out in San Francisco do <eos> And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee <eos> A place where even squares can have a ball; <eos> We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse <eos> White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear <eos> Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen; <eos> A football's still the roughest thing on campus <eos> And the kids here still respect the college dean <eos> And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee <eos> A place where even squares can have a ball; <eos> We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse <eos> White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> (In Muskogee Oklahoma USA) <eos> 
Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair <eos> With the roses so red and the lilies so fair <eos> And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew <eos> The pale amanita and eyes look like blue <eos> I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay <eos> I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway <eos> When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay <eos> All portion of love had all flown away <eos> Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love <eos> And to cherish me over all others above <eos> How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell <eos> He's left me no warning, no words of farewell <eos> Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower <eos> That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour <eos> Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour <eos> He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower <eos> 
Pulled into your driveway <eos> An hour ago <eos> Sit in front of my place <eos> Saying I don’t wanna be alone <eos> I really think I like you <eos> But I don’t understand <eos> Most of the things that I do <eos> I’m so sorry man <eos> I need Dramamine when I’m with you <eos> Cause you move faster than my trust issues <eos> Now I’ll bite my tongue <eos> And I’m scared that <eos> I’ll say something dumb <eos> I can’t take back <eos> What is it about me <eos> That makes me so mean <eos> But tell me why I miss you <eos> Whenever I’m with you <eos> Every night I can’t sleep <eos> Unless you’re next to me <eos> There’s just something about you <eos> That makes me doubt you <eos> Took you to meet my parents <eos> I said here’s my friеnd <eos> When we talk I’m oversharing <eos> Plеase cut me off again <eos> I don’t want life to pass me by <eos> I’m just trying to understand <eos> I think I’m done overthinking it <eos> I’m so sorry man <eos> I need Dramamine when I’m with you <eos> Cause you move faster than my trust issues <eos> Now I’ll bite my tongue <eos> And I’m scared that <eos> I’ll say something dumb <eos> I can’t take back <eos> What is it about me <eos> That makes me so mean <eos> But tell me why I miss you <eos> Whenever I’m with you <eos> Every night I can’t sleep <eos> Unless you’re next to me <eos> There’s just something about you <eos> That makes me doubt you <eos> 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And never brought to mind? <eos> Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And days auld lang syne? <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll drink a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> Where we, too, have run about the braes <eos> And pulled the gowans fine <eos> But we've wandered many a weary foot <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We, too, have pedaled in the burn <eos> From morning sun 'till dine <eos> But seas between us braid have roared <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> And there's a hand, my trusty fiere <eos> And he's a hand o' thine <eos> And we'll take a right gude-willy waught <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang- one more time! <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For <eos> (Auld lang) <eos> Lang syne <eos> 
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you <eos> Or tell you that <eos> But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it <eos> Where's the sense in that? <eos> I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder <eos> Or return to where we were <eos> But I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrender <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> I know I left too much mess and <eos> Destruction to come back again <eos> And I caused nothing but trouble <eos> I understand if you can't talk to me again <eos> And if you live by the rules of "it's over" <eos> Then I'm surе that that makes sense <eos> But I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrеnder <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> And when we meet <eos> Which I'm sure we will <eos> All that was there <eos> Will be there still <eos> I'll let it pass <eos> And hold my tongue <eos> And you will think <eos> That I've moved on <eos> I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrender <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> 
You've heard it all, I’ve whispered to my mother next to you <eos> Wanting to be folded in grey and blue <eos> I'll eat the East River before it eats me <eos> But it'll take me before I get the chance to, dig in my teeth <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> You've heard it all I've whispered to my mother next to you <eos> I hate the Hudson River, I'm loyal to you <eos> I’ll eat the scuba divers if they eat me <eos> But they’ll take me before I get the chance to, swallow them whole <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> ’Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not around here, I'm just so sore <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> 
Oh, my man <eos> I hope your heart <eos> Won't pretend <eos> You ain't that hard <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> No, I never did <eos> Oh, my man <eos> I hoped your heart <eos> Won't pretend <eos> You ain't that far <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore, anymore <eos> Oh, my friend <eos> I hope you're here <eos> Oh, pretend <eos> You ain't that near <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> And, oh (Oh) , I don't love you <eos> Anymore (Oh) <eos> You and me <eos> We fail to see <eos> (And, oh) <eos> Deep in my eyes <eos> We fail to fly <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides were beautiful <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides, were beautiful <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides, that's what's beautiful <eos> Insides were beautiful <eos> Insides, that's what's beautiful <eos> We're inside, it's beautiful <eos> 
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do <eos> Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed <eos> Watching you spin in that dress <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> I keep checking you for halos <eos> Swear you're an angel in disguise <eos> You poke my mind from every angle, and I <eos> I can see Heaven in your eyes <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for <eos> And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful <eos> Oh, baby <eos> 'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees) <eos> Whoa, you make me believe <eos> Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos>

Te mando flores que recojo en el camino <eos> Yo te las mando entre mis sueños <eos> Porque no puedo hablar contigo <eos> Y te mando besos en mis canciones <eos> Y por las noches cuando duermo <eos> Se juntan nuestros corazones <eos> Te vuelves aire <eos> Si de noche hay Luna llena <eos> Si siento frío en la mañana <eos> Tu recuerdo me calienta <eos> Y tu sonrisa cuando despiertas <eos> Mi niña linda, yo te juro <eos> Que cada día te veo más cerca <eos> Y entre mis sueños dormido <eos> Trato yo de hablar contigo y sentirte cerca de mí <eos> Quiero tenerte en mis brazos <eos> Poder salir y abrazarte y nunca más dejarte ir <eos> Quiero encontrarte en mis sueños <eos> Que me levantes a besos <eos> Ningún lugar está lejos para encontrarnos los dos <eos> Déjame darte la mano para tenerte a mi lado <eos> Mi niña, yo te prometo que seré siempre tu amor <eos> No te vayas por favor <eos> Te mando flores que recojo en el camino <eos> Yo te las mando entre mis sueños <eos> Porque no puedo hablar contigo <eos> Y voy preparando diez mil palabras <eos> Pa' convencerte que a mi lado <eos> Todo será como soñamos <eos> Y entre mis sueños dormido <eos> Trato yo de hablar contigo y sentirte cerca de mí <eos> Quiero tenerte en mis brazos <eos> Poder salir y abrazarte y nunca más dejarte ir <eos> Quiero encontrarte en mis sueños <eos> Que me levantes a besos <eos> Ningún lugar está lejos para encontrarnos los dos <eos> Déjame darte la mano para tenerte a mi lado <eos> Mi niña, yo te prometo que seré siempre tu amor <eos> No te vayas por favor <eos> (Dale Cali) <eos> Te mando flores pa' que adornes tu casa <eos> Que las más rojas estén siempre a la entrada <eos> Cada mañana que no les falte agua <eos> Bien tempranito levántate a regarlas <eos> A cada una puedes ponerle un nombre <eos> Para que atiendan siempre tu llamada <eos> Cosita linda puede ser la más gorda <eos> La margarita que se llame Mariana <eos> Te mando flores pa' que adornes tu casa <eos> Que las más rojas estén siempre a la entrada <eos> Cada mañana que no les falte agua <eos> Bien tempranito levántate a regarlas <eos> A cada una puedes ponerle un nombre <eos> Para que atiendan siempre tu llamada <eos> Cosita linda puede ser la más gorda <eos> La margarita que se llame Mariana <eos> Te mando flores pa' que adornes tu casa <eos> Que las más rojas estén siempre a la entrada <eos> Cada mañana que no les falte agua <eos> Bien tempranito levántate a regarlas <eos> A cada una puedes ponerle un nombre <eos> Para que atiendan siempre tu llamada <eos> Cosita linda puede ser la más gorda <eos> Y la margarita que se llame Mariana <eos> 
Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago <eos> Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator. Tommy the cat had many a story to tell, but it was a rare occasion such as this that he did <eos> She came a'sliding on down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot Biscuit. The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days. The sight was beyond belief. Many a head snapped for double even triple, takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbys were known to hang out. They hung out in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place... and that was O'malley's Alley. <eos> The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended) But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was looking for that stud bull. She was looking for that He-cat. And that was me. Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee: <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby! <eos> Say baby! <eos> 
You and me, we used to be together <eos> Every day together, always <eos> I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend <eos> I can't believe this could be the end <eos> It looks as though you're lettin' go <eos> And if it's real, well, I don't want to know <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Our memories, well, they can be inviting <eos> But some are altogether mighty frightening <eos> As we die, both you and I <eos> With my head in my hands, I sit and cry <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (No, no, no) <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> It's all ending <eos> We gotta stop pretending who we are <eos> You and me <eos> I can see us dyin', aren't we? <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> I know what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak, no <eos> I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> I know you're good, I know you're good <eos> I know you're real good, oh <eos> La, la, la, la, la, la <eos> Don't, don't, ooh, ooh <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Oh, hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Now if there's a smile on my face <eos> It's only there tryin’ to fool the public <eos> But when it comes down to foolin’ you <eos> Now, honey, that's quite a different subject <eos> But don't let my glad expression <eos> Give you the wrong impression <eos> Really I'm sad (Sad, sad, sad, sad) <eos> Oh sadder than sad (I'm hurt so bad) <eos> You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad (I pretend to be glad) <eos> Like a clown, I pretend to be glad (Sad, sad, sad, sad) <eos> Now there's some sad things known to man <eos> But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah, baby <eos> Now if I appear to be carefree <eos> It's only to camouflage my sadness <eos> In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried <eos> To cover this hurt with a show of gladness <eos> But don't let my show convince you <eos> That I've been happy since you <eos> Decided to go (Why did you go?) <eos> Oh I need you so (I need you so) <eos> I'm hurt and I want you to know (Want you to know) <eos> But for others I put on a show (It's just a show) <eos> Ooh oh <eos> There's some sad things known to man <eos> But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender) <eos> I try to keep my sadness hid <eos> Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender) <eos> But in my lonely room I cry the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah, baby <eos> Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown) <eos> Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown) <eos> Give you the wrong impression <eos> Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown) <eos> Make you think that I don't care <eos> When really I'm sad (Tears of a clown) <eos> Hurtin’ so bad <eos> Cryin’... <eos> 
De nada sirve el porque <eos> De nada sirve el valor <eos> De nada sirve volver <eos> De nada sirve el adiós <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Yo me pregunte hasta cuando <eos> Te querré como hasta hoy <eos> Vos me enseñaste llorando <eos> Que de nada sirve el adiós <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Me gusta lo que no tengo y quiero lo que no doy <eos> No me compren no a mi mismo <eos> No se entregarte la vida tampoco vivir sin vos <eos> Yo se que de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Mi jardín ya no te espera porque ya corte la flor <eos> Y todo lo que me queda es cantarte con el alma si te regale la voz <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Mi amor <eos> Mi amor seguro de nada sirve <eos> Porque ya corte la flor <eos> Mi amor seguro de nada sirve <eos> 
Botella tras botella ando tomando pa' olvidarme de ella (Pa' olvidarme de ella) <eos> De ella, de ella nomás hablo en todas mis pedas (En todas mis pedas) <eos> A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (Jajai) <eos> Me dicen: "Güey, ya la tienes que superar" <eos> Pero yo no puedo (Yo no puedo) <eos> Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero <eos> Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo <eos> Los tragos me saben mejor así <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte, yo te miro por todas partes <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos, puede que lo olvidemos <eos> Dos tragos y vuelvo a pensarte <eos> Me aferro, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Sentimientos ajenos, los celos no son buenos <eos> Y si me llamas contesto, aunque nunca va a pasar eso <eos> (Aunque nunca va a pasar eso) <eos> Ya mejor ni te molesto, porque sé que vuelvo a joderlo <eos> (Ahuevo que vuelvo a joderlo) <eos> Y ahora que ando tomando bebida me siento triste, ya va a amanecer <eos> A vece' borracho las penas se olvidan, pero nunca te dejé de querer <eos> Fui mal partido, querida, todas mis pedas marcándote al cel <eos> Le puse sal a la herida, cómo quisiera volver al ayer <eos> Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti <eos> (Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti) <eos> Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD <eos> (Y hasta te escribí un CD) <eos> Botella tras botella vo'a tomarme pa' acordarme de ella (Pa' acordarme de ella) <eos> De ella, de ella estoy hablando como siempre en mis pedas (Como siempre en mis pedas) <eos> A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (Jajai) <eos> Me dicen: "Güey, ya la tienes que superar" <eos> Pero yo no puedo (Yo no puedo) <eos> Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero <eos> Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo <eos> Los tragos me saben mejor así <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte yo <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte yo <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos <eos> Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti <eos> (Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti) <eos> Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD <eos> (Y hasta te escribí un CD) <eos> Y si amas a alguien, no la dejes ir <eos> Para que no tengas que dedicarle una canción como esta <eos> Paz <eos>

I guess this time you're really leavin' <eos> I heard your suitcase say goodbye <eos> Well as my broken heart lies bleedin' <eos> You say true love is suicide <eos> You say you've cried a thousand rivers <eos> And now you're swimmin' for the shore <eos> You left me drownin' in my tears <eos> And you won't save me anymore <eos> I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl <eos> I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you <eos> When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you <eos> I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you <eos> Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you <eos> I know you know we've had some good times <eos> Now they have their own hidin' place <eos> Well, I can promise you tomorrow <eos> But I can't buy back yesterday <eos> And, baby, you know my hands are dirty <eos> (But I wanted to be your valentine) <eos> But I wanted to be your valentine <eos> I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby <eos> When you get drunk, I'll be the wine <eos> I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you <eos> When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you <eos> I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you <eos> Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you <eos> And I wasn't there when you were happy <eos> (And I wasn't there to make you happy) <eos> I wasn't there when you were down <eos> I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby <eos> I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out <eos> I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you <eos> When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you <eos> I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you <eos> Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for <eos> I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you <eos> When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you <eos> I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you <eos> Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you <eos> Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah <eos> Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah <eos> Woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah, oh, oh, woah <eos> 
I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I remember the times when we used to <eos> Sit in the park holding hands together <eos> I never should have gone away and left you like I did <eos> I thought you'd take me back, but I was just a little <eos> Bit late <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl <eos> On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you <eos> Tight <eos> Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way <eos> It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl <eos> On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you <eos> Tight <eos> Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way <eos> It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> 
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone <eos> Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you <eos> I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song <eos> I just can't remember who to send it to <eos> I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Won't you look down upon me, Jesus <eos> You've got to help me make a stand <eos> You've just got to see me through another day <eos> My body's aching and my time is at hand <eos> And I won't make it any other way <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun <eos> Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around <eos> Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come <eos> Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now <eos> Thought I'd see you one more time again <eos> There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now <eos> Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now <eos> 
I get lost in your eyes <eos> And I feel my spirits rise <eos> And soar like the wind <eos> Is it love that I am in? <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> And now I know <eos> 'Cause when I'm lost <eos> I can let go <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I just fell <eos> Don't know why <eos> Something's there we can't deny <eos> And when I first knew <eos> Was when I first looked at you <eos> And if I can't find my way <eos> If salvation is worlds away <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> Oh it's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos> 
Not a cloud showed out in the sky <eos> That very night in Pitch Black City <eos> I was so damned scared, it was dark <eos> It was so dim, it was a shame <eos> Just then a man walked up to me and said <eos> Didn't I see you here before <eos> The lights were low and the party was so dull <eos> Just not good enough <eos> Holiday (Ey, hey, hey, hey, hey) <eos> Holiday (Holiday, what you say) <eos> Holiday <eos> Celebrate (Ah yeah) <eos> Holiday <eos> Holiday (Alright) <eos> Holiday <eos> Celebrate <eos> Then we both held hands in each other's <eos> For a chance to start it moving <eos> He reached deep inside of his vest <eos> And in his hand he held a ring <eos> Let's have lunch, picnic or a brunch in the wintertime <eos> Let's disco down in a rollerskating ring in Alaska town <eos> Holiday (Holiday) <eos> Holiday (Come on, come on celebrate) <eos> Holiday (Woo, woo, woo, woo) <eos> Celebrate <eos> Holiday (Got the feeling, come on, keep ahead) <eos> Holiday (Reelin' holiday, yea, yea) <eos> Holiday <eos> Celebrate <eos> Not a cloud showed out in the sky <eos> That very night in Pitch Black City <eos> I was so damned scared, it was dark <eos> It was so dim, it was a shame <eos> Just then a man walked up to me and said <eos> Didn't I see you here before <eos> The lights were low and the party was so dull <eos> Just not good enough <eos> Holiday <eos> Holiday <eos> Holiday <eos> Celebrate <eos> (Repeat) <eos>

Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que nada de ayer hoy te hace llorar <eos> Tú con él <eos> El tiempo corre, yo te espero, pero tú con él <eos> Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Estás tranquila, lo mereces, siempre fuiste bien <eos> Tú con él <eos> No me sorprende, sospechaba terminar así <eos> Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Que tú podías, si querías vivir sin su amor <eos> Perdóname <eos> No me di cuenta de ese juego y me enamoré <eos> Después fue tarde, no podía ya volver atrás <eos> Y te quería cada día más y más <eos> Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que puedes hacer lo que quieras tú <eos> Tú con él <eos> Ya me han contado que estás linda, mucho más que ayer <eos> Que no me odias y preguntas siempre algo de mí <eos> Al fin y al cabo un poquito yo me hice querer <eos> Disculpame <eos> Aquellos celos tan intensos que senti por ti <eos> Estaba loco, casi loco, por aquel amor <eos> Y al poco tiempo para siempre lo perdí <eos> Tú con él Aún recuerdo el romance que viviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Yo sé que jugaste con mis sentimientos <eos> Tú con él Todo fue un juego que tuviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Pero en ese juego yo me enamoré <eos> Tú con él Yo no me di cuenta, escucha mujer <eos> Tú con él Pero te lo juro, mamita, desperté <eos> Tú con él Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Tú con él Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Tú con él Que tú podías, si te querías vivir sin él <eos> Tú con él En el juego del amor, unos vienen y otros van <eos>

Have you got colour in your cheeks? <eos> Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type <eos> That sticks around like summat in your teeth? <eos> Are there some aces up your sleeve? <eos> Have you no idea that you're in deep? <eos> I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week <eos> How many secrets can you keep? <eos> 'Cause there's this tune I found <eos> That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat <eos> Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee <eos> (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways? <eos> (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay <eos> (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made <eos> For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <eos> Crawlin' back to you <eos> Ever thought of callin' when <eos> You've had a few? <eos> 'Cause I always do <eos> Maybe I'm too <eos> Busy bein' yours <eos> To fall for somebody new <eos> Now, I've thought it through <eos> Crawlin' back to you <eos> So have you got the guts? <eos> Been wonderin' if your heart's still open <eos> And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts <eos> Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt <eos> It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you <eos> I don't know if you feel the same as I do <eos> But we could be together if you wanted to <eos> (Do I wanna know?)

Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Life just got in the way, don't know what to say <eos> She's heard it all before, lying on her bedroom floor <eos> Thinking my life has to be worth more <eos> She dreams of going to New York City <eos> Her heart's already there but her head's fighting a war <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking for a star but it's just too dark <eos> When streams get a little bit wider <eos> And it's hard to swim across the water <eos> And the scars get a little bit deeper <eos> And a flame turns into a fire <eos> Tonight whеn you need a way home <eos> Someone to lеan on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> Old man trying to make it on his own <eos> Looking at the space where his wife once was <eos> Wants to find just something to believe in <eos> He hears a knock at the door this evening <eos> She says I'm going to New York City to follow my dreams <eos> Would you come with me? <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking at the stars in her granddad's eyes <eos> And the streams get a little bit wider <eos> But together they cross the river <eos> And the scars get a little bit lighter <eos> And the sky looks a little brighter <eos> Tonight when you need a way home <eos> Someone to lean on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos>

He intentado casi todo para convencerte, uh <eos> Mientras el mundo se derrumba todo, aquí a mis pies, yeah <eos> Mientras aprendo de esta soledad que desconozco, woah <eos> Me vuelvo a preguntar quizás si sobreviviré <eos> Porque sin ti me queda la conciencia helada y vacía <eos> Porque sin ti me he dado cuenta amor que no renaceré, yeah <eos> Porque he ido más allá del límite de la desolación <eos> Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Ay, yo te juro que <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida (No) <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Qué no dejaría <eos> Y duelen más la' cosa' buena' cuando estás ausente <eos> Yo sé que e' demasiado tarde para remediar <eos> No me queda bien valerme de diez mil excusas <eos> Cuando definitivamente sé que ahora te vas <eos> Y aunque no lo pueda cambiar, yo seguiré esperándote <eos> Por si algún día tú me quiere' ver bien <eos> Aunque te vuelva a repetir que estoy muriendo día a día <eos> Aunque también estés muriendo, tú no me perdonarás <eos> Aunque sin ti haya llegado al límite de la desolación <eos> Y mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Yo sigo muriéndome <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión (Mi religión) <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos (Yeah) <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe, oh <eos> CNCO <eos>

Barefoot in the sand <eos> Wishing God would lend a hand <eos> Wave after wave comes crashing down <eos> Washing away a little more ground <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Walking along with the ocean at my heels <eos> Loving the way the water feels <eos> Up in the sky something catches my eye <eos> As bright as a star in the northern sky <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want to touch you <eos> 
Blue jeans, white shirt <eos> Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn <eos> It was like James Dean for sure <eos> You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer <eos> You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop <eos> But you fit me better than my favorite sweater <eos> And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh) <eos> But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos> Big dreams, gangsta <eos> Said you had to leave to start your life over <eos> I was like, "No, please—stay here <eos> We don't need no money, we could make it all work" <eos> But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday <eos> I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing <eos> But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh) <eos> Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos> You went out every night, and baby, that's alright <eos> I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side <eos> 'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly <eos> Well, shit, at least you tried <eos> But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died <eos> Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind <eos> I just want it like before, we were dancing all night <eos> Then they took you away, stole you out of my life <eos> You just need to remember <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos>

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening <eos> In the lane snow is glistening <eos> A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Gone away is the bluebird <eos> Here to stay is a new bird <eos> He sings a love song as we go along <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> Then pretend that he is Parson Brown <eos> He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man" <eos> But you can do the job when you're in town <eos> Later on we'll conspire <eos> As we dream by the fire <eos> To face unafraid, the plans that we've made <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Over the ground lies the mantle of light <eos> A heaven of diamond in the lovely night <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown <eos> He'll say, "Are you married?" And then we'll say, "No man" <eos> But now you can do the job whenever you're in town <eos> Later on we'll conspire <eos> As we dream sittin' by the fire <eos> To face unafraid all the plans that we've made <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Sleigh bells ring, are you listening <eos> In the lane snow is glistening <eos> A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Walking, walking in a winter wonderland <eos>

You never act aloud the way you appear <eos> My every breath awakes alarms in your ears <eos> I'm not confused, it's just you're making me think <eos> Of all our conversations missing their link <eos> I wanna know all the dreams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I plan to take <eos> And I hope you won't care <eos> But all your makeup's running <eos> And I'm walking you home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> I see you more at night then you do the day <eos> I'm more concerned for what you'll leave if you stay <eos> I'm not confused, it's just I don't wanna talk <eos> It seems the key was not to peek through the locks <eos> So I wanna hear all the screams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I never take <eos> And I know you don't care <eos> But all those pretty people are still going home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> Like this, like this, like this <eos>

(Tenement slum <eos> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah) <eos> You think that I don't feel love <eos> But what I feel for you is real love <eos> In those eyes, I see reflected <eos> A hurt, scorned, rejected <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, born in poverty <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, take a look at me <eos> Started my life in an old, cold, rundown <eos> Tenement slum (Tenement slum) <eos> My father left, he never even married Mom <eos> I shared the guilt my mama knew <eos> So afraid that others knew I had no name <eos> Ah, this love we're contemplating <eos> Is worth the pain of waiting <eos> We'll only end up hating <eos> The child we may be creating <eos> Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child (Scorned by) society <eos> Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, different from the rest <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out) <eos> I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt <eos> To be without the simple things <eos> So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me <eos> Ah, don't think that I don't need you <eos> Don't think I don't wanna please you <eos> But no child of mine will be bearing <eos> The name of shame I've been wearing <eos> Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> You (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos>

Well, I heard you crying loud <eos> All the way across town <eos> You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl <eos> As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself <eos> Well, don't get lonely now <eos> And dry your whining eyes <eos> I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get <eos> So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> Oh, I heard it all before <eos> So don't knock down my door <eos> I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser <eos> To try and slag me down because I know you're right <eos> So go do what you like <eos> Make sure you do it wise <eos> You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there <eos> You can't go forcing something if it's just not right <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos>

Looking in your eyes <eos> I see a memory <eos> Of how it used to be <eos> Before our world came tumbling down <eos> I try <eos> I did nothing else <eos> But try to keep our love alive <eos> Oh, how I loved you so <eos> And you just made me cry <eos> Did you deceive me? <eos> Did you do me wrong? <eos> Boy, I can`t take it <eos> Can`t take it anymore <eos> I feel so helpless <eos> Not knowing what to do <eos> Do I keep on crying? <eos> Or do I leave you? <eos> Boy, I`ve been told <eos> Leaving you is the thing to do <eos> It would be easy <eos> If I didn`t want to start anew <eos> Boy, I`ve been told <eos> Leaving you is the thing to do <eos> It won`t be easy <eos> Cause breaking up is hard to do <eos> Touch this lonely heart <eos> As I try to say to you <eos> About the things you do <eos> Now I`m alone <eos> Dissatisfied <eos> Did you deceive me? <eos> Did you do me wrong? <eos> Boy, I can`t take it <eos> Can`t take it anymore <eos> I feel so helpless <eos> Not knowing what to do <eos> Do I keep on crying? <eos> Or do I leave you? <eos> Just like my friend said <eos> You were never good for me <eos> So just go about your way <eos> Don`t worry about me <eos> And just forget we ever happened <eos> The time has come to say goodbye <eos> Don`t ask why <eos> Just let it all go <eos> I`ve made it through <eos> There`s someone new <eos> 
You know that it would be untrue <eos> You know that I would be a liar <eos> If I was to say to you <eos> Girl, we couldn't get much higher <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> The time to hesitate is through <eos> No time to wallow in the mire <eos> Try, now we can only lose <eos> And our love become a funeral pyre <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> Yeah... <eos> The time to hesitate is through <eos> No time to wallow in the mire <eos> Try, now we can only lose <eos> And our love become a funeral pyre <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> Yeah! <eos> You know that it would be untrue <eos> You know that I would be a liar <eos> If I was to say to you <eos> Girl, we couldn't get much higher <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Come on, baby, light my fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos> Try to set the night on fire <eos>

I got good at holdin' back, never gettin' too attached <eos> I got good at knowin' that I'd be alone on Frdiday <eos> I got good at tellin' me my Romeo was make-believe <eos> He's gotta be 'cause, honestly, why else would I be lonely? <eos> Who wants to keep on pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> Yeah, just to let somebody break it more <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> You said I got it all wrong, you could turn my heart back on <eos> And that you'll always love me like that classic Dolly Parton song <eos> You had no problem pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> I can't believe what I believed before <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> Nobody's kissed me in the pourin' rain <eos> No one could ever get this stubborn girl to change <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> Now I turn up every love song <eos> And I'm the first one to admit <eos> Never thought I'd wanna say "I do" <eos> Just look at what you did <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> You did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> 
I'm in, I'm in too deep <eos> Can't keep my head above water <eos> It's hard to breathe <eos> Drownin', fallin' beneath <eos> I think I need a minute <eos> Or I'll run out of speed <eos> Every night, I'm searchin' for something new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour, ah <eos> It's happy hour <eos> It's happy hour <eos> Hold me, hold me tonight <eos> It's the last thing I remember <eos> It's slowly dyin' <eos> You make me feel alive <eos> Every second spent togеther <eos> Was satisfyin' <eos> Every night, I'm searchin' for somеthing new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> Searchin' for something new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour, ah <eos> It's happy hour <eos> It's happy hour <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos>

Some kids have and some don't <eos> And some of us are wondering why <eos> Mom won't watch the news at night <eos> There's too much stuff that's making her cry <eos> We need some help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> A house, a yard <eos> A neighbourhood <eos> Where you can ride your new bike to school <eos> A kind of world where Mom and Dad <eos> Still believe in the golden rule <eos> Life's not that simple <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice, one simple word <eos> Hearts know what to say <eos> One dream can change the world <eos> Keep believing <eos> Till you find a way <eos> Yesterday, while walking home <eos> I saw a kid on Newberry Road <eos> He pulled a pistol from his bag <eos> And tossed it in the river below <eos> Thanks for the help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> 
This town was built on miles of hope <eos> And I dare you to give me one reason to stay <eos> And maybe I won't go away <eos> So far you've only dared me once <eos> And I think we know that's not even close enough <eos> Not enough for me to stay <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Well I'm getting tired of standing around <eos> Just sitting here and waiting to be found <eos> Same old shit just a different day <eos> Well I'll wait around for one more day <eos> But I know that's what I will always say <eos> Will this ever be O.K.? <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> 
Late at night <eos> When you're out doing your thing do I cross your mind <eos> Am I still someone you need when you close your eyes <eos> Is it only me you see 'cause you and I that's my favourite memory <eos> All the right moves but I can't go home <eos> All the right feels, I'm not ready to show <eos> Crowded room but I feel so alone <eos> You should be here, you should be here <eos> All these new faces, I gotta know <eos> All these new places, I wanna go <eos> Life is so strange gettin' out on my own <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you were herе <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you werе here <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you were here <eos> Now and then <eos> I have dreams about the future that you're starring in <eos> Don't think I'll ever be used to being just a friend <eos> Underestimated what it takes to start again, to start a-gain <eos> All the right moves but I can't go home <eos> All the right feels, I'm not ready to show <eos> Crowded room but I feel so alone <eos> You should be here, you should be here <eos> All these new faces, I gotta know <eos> All these new places, I wanna go <eos> Life is so strange gettin' out on my own <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you were here <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you were here <eos> And I'm still here wishin' you were here <eos> 
One day, we'll meet trouble halfway <eos> And we'll say; "Oh why'd you gotta be that way?" <eos> Trouble look around you <eos> Everything is beautiful <eos> Yeah, look around you <eos> What'd you go and do that for? <eos> One day we'll meet trouble halfway <eos> And she'll say; <eos> "Just a taste and I'll be on my way." <eos> Oh, you think I want to hang around here? <eos> No, I'll never again darken your door <eos> You stepped to her with no fear <eos> Said; "These aren't the droids you're looking for." <eos> 'Cus baby one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Even without trying to <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> One day, we'll meet trouble half way <eos> And we'll take the window <eos> In a diner off the highway <eos> Saying; "Trouble, let's work this thing out." <eos> On the table I'm squeezing your hand <eos> And give me the steel <eos> To say; "Now this is how it's gonna be" <eos> 'Cus baby, one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Even without trying to <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Baby, one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Even without trying to <eos> You got me on the upswing <eos> Yeah, you got me on the upswing <eos> Yeah, you got me on the upswing <eos> Yeah, you got me on the upswing <eos> Baby, one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Baby, one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Even without trying to <eos> You got me on the upswing <eos> Just when I thought I was through <eos> You got me on the upswing <eos> (We can both try) <eos> Baby one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> (Yes, it's none of our business) <eos> Baby one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> Baby one little push from you <eos> Got me on the upswing <eos> 
I've spent way too much time moving on <eos> Tried a couple of therapists <eos> Even got rid of some stuff <eos> It's like my mind got a mind of its own <eos> 'Cause I've been busy getting over <eos> Getting over someone <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like my skin isn't longing <eos> After the weight of your touch <eos> It's what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Someone left me with a broken heart <eos> That I passed on to someone <eos> And broke a new one apart <eos> Things can be good enough <eos> Still not enough <eos> And that's why I'm terrified <eos> Having you by my side <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like it ain't a habit <eos> Thinking 'bout "what if" too much <eos> Like what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> 
Preparé el café como siempre <eos> El mismo desayuno de los viernes <eos> Y no estabas, tú no estabas <eos> Sé que prometí ser paciente <eos> ¿Pero qué le hago si me duele? <eos> La distancia nos tiene en pausa <eos> Solo sé bailar si tú bailas conmigo <eos> Todo está tan mal si yo no estoy contigo, contigo <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> De amor de amor <eos> Porque yo te extraño desde la' 9 a las 5 <eos> Yo te extraño viernes, sábado y domingo <eos> Dime cuándo llega' (Dime cuándo llega') <eos> Pa' recogerte con cartel y con globito (Hmm-mm) <eos> Yo ya no quiero dormir solito <eos> ¿De qué me sirven los 5 sentidos si no te tengo conmigo? <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (Avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor (Me muero de amor) <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor <eos> Me pregunto cuánto falta <eos> Entiende cuánto me haces falta <eos> Ya no quiero la distancia <eos> Ya devuélveme la calma <eos> Un, dos, tres de la mañana <eos> Y la cama que te extraña <eos> Me pregunta cuánto falta <eos> Para ver tu cara <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (El primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves, no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer, el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Que yo te extraño) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor (Me estoy muriendo lento, lento, lento) <eos> To' los días que no puedo vivir sin ti (Ay, lento, lento, lento) <eos> Me haces falta (Tanta falta) <eos> Ay, móntante en el avión y ven <eos> 
Dreams, that's where I have to go <eos> To see your beautiful face anymore <eos> I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio <eos> Hope, hope there's a conversation <eos> We both admit, we had it good <eos> But until then it's alienation, I know <eos> That much is understood <eos> And I realise <eos> If you asked me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> (Not over you) <eos> Damn, damn girl, you do it well <eos> And I thought you were innocent <eos> You took this heart and put it through hell <eos> But still you're magnificent <eos> And I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me <eos> I turn around and I'm back in the game <eos> Even better than the old me <eos> But I'm not even close without you <eos> If you ask me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> And if I had the chance to renew <eos> You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do <eos> I could get back on the right track <eos> But only if you'd be convinced <eos> So until then <eos> If you ask me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> Not over you, not over you, not over you <eos> 
You broke me first <eos> Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a while, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first (You broke me first) <eos> You broke me first, ooh oh <eos> 
In the bleak midwinter, frost winds made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow <eos> In the bleak midwinter, long ago <eos> Angels and archangels may have gathered there <eos> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air <eos> But his mother only, in her maiden bliss <eos> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss <eos> Hm <eos> Oh, what can I give him, poor as I am? <eos> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb <eos> If I were a wise man, I would do my part <eos> Yet what I can I give him <eos> I will give my heart <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> 
Uti vår hage där växa blå bär <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Vill du mig något så träffas vi där <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Kom rosor och saliveja <eos> Kom ljuva krusmynta <eos> Kom hjärtans kär <eos> Fagra små blommor där bjuda till dans <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Vill du så binder jag åt dig en krans <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Kransen sätter jag sen i ditt hår <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Solen den dalar men hoppet upp går <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Uti vår hage finns blommor och bär <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Men utav alla mej kärast du är <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> 
When I'm alone <eos> I talk to myself <eos> Like I'm talking to you <eos> Talking to you <eos> I lie on the couch <eos> And hum a little tune <eos> Hmm-mm <eos> I'm singing to you <eos> And I know it'll take a little more time to get through <eos> 'Cause I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> You know I can't control it <eos> I'm acting like such a fool <eos> And I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> Here still wishing and hoping and waiting to hear it from you <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> If I fall asleep <eos> And find you in a dream <eos> Lying next to me <eos> Next to me <eos> I'm holding my breath <eos> We're tangled in sheets <eos> And I wanna believe <eos> I wanna believe <eos> But in the morning I'm still waiting for this dream <eos> To come true <eos> 'Cause I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> You know I can't control it <eos> I'm acting like such a fool <eos> And I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> Here still wishing and hoping and waiting to hear it from you <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> 
Where has it gone, that fire <eos> That from the darkn ess kept us <eos> Where all the righteous souls <eos> With flames in their eyes <eos> Yet in the end <eos> The gilded tongues <eos> Yes, in the end <eos> They burrowed in spines <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Step forward, lost seeker <eos> Read the signs of silence <eos> Come close, turn the last stone <eos> Truth lies in violence <eos> See the limbs of chilling mist <eos> Creeping these desolate halls <eos> Searching, it seems for solace <eos> For some haven <eos> From this terrible cold <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Yes, in the end, the gilded ones <eos> They were serpentine <eos> 
You wanna know if I know why? <eos> I can't say that I do <eos> Don't understand the evil eye <eos> Or how one becomes two <eos> And I just can't recall what started it all <eos> Or how to begin in the end <eos> I ain't here to break it <eos> Just see how far it will bend <eos> Again and again, again and again <eos> I wanna make it <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> (Anytime, anywhere) <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> Sometimes the same is different <eos> But mostly it's the same <eos> These mysteries of life <eos> That jus' ain't my thing <eos> If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon <eos> I'd be untrue <eos> The only thing I know for sure <eos> Is what I wanna do <eos> Anytime, anywhere, and I say babe <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> (Anytime, anywhere) <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Anytime, anywhere) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> (Yeah) <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Whooo) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Anytime, anywhere) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again) <eos> I wanna make it wit chu <eos> I wanna make it <eos> (Again and again and again and again and again) <eos> 
No matter where you are <eos> I can still hear you when you drown <eos> You've traveled very far <eos> Just to see you I'll come around <eos> When I'm down <eos> All of those yesterdays <eos> Coming down <eos> No matter where you are <eos> I can still hear you when you dream <eos> You traveled very far <eos> You traveled far, like a star <eos> And you are <eos> All of those yesterdays <eos> Coming down <eos> Is it something someone said? <eos> Was it something someone said? <eos> Yesterday the sky was you <eos> And I still feel the same <eos> Nothing left for me to do <eos> And I still feel the same <eos> I wish, I wish I could fly <eos> I wish, I wish I could lie <eos> I will, I will try <eos> I will, I will <eos> Goodbye <eos> 
Honey, you <eos> You can get on a train <eos> Take it to another town <eos> Leave your friends behind <eos> And you <eos> You could even change your clothes <eos> Throw away your blue jeans <eos> Trade em for a suit and tie <eos> But after all this time <eos> I'm still getting used to having you around <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> It's alright <eos> If you wanna start again <eos> Own a little piece of land <eos> Watch the way things grow <eos> And I, I could even follow you there <eos> I could keep the fire lit <eos> Forget what I used to know <eos> I might like the way your face turns brown in the summer <eos> When we're living out in the sun <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> After all this time <eos> I think I'm getting used to having you around <eos> So please <eos> So please <eos> Please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things that you don't need, you don't need <eos> 
Together again, my tears have stopped falling <eos> The long lonely nights are now at an end <eos> The key to my heart you hold in your hand <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos> Together again, the gray skies are gone <eos> You're back in my arms now, where you belong <eos> The love that I knew is living again <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos>

En el pasado y me pone a imaginar <eos> Si mañana te quedas o mañana tú te vas <eos> Yo te amaba mucho, eso no voy a negar <eos> ¿Cómo iba saber que conmigo no sentías igual? <eos> Tu falsedad lo único que me supistes a dar <eos> Mientras yo aquí entregándote lo que tú me pidas <eos> Me lo hiciste mal, eso no se va perdonar <eos> Por tu culpa es imposible pa' volver a amar <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedan bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Todo por tu culpa, chiquitita <eos> Puro Porte Diferente <eos> Mi corazón no tiene sentido, es una piedra <eos> Se acabó el cariño que adentro yo tenía <eos> No tengo motivación para yo continuar <eos> Mi vida se ha acabado desde que tú ya no estás <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedo bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Y puro Rancho Humilde <eos>

Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> And tell me, have you found a new man? <eos> Tell me, have you moved on? <eos> 'Cause me, I'm gettin' tired <eos> And this road, it's gettin' hard <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> And it's a fucked up situation I put us in <eos> When the woman I left you for left me for another man <eos> And I guess I should apologize <eos> But I never could lay down my pride <eos> 'Cause it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> Oh <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back <eos> Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> 
Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> I'm trying to make a brand new friend <eos> And everybody trying to fight <eos> It ain't easy, it ain't fair <eos> Is the world so messed up <eos> Am I the only one to care? <eos> So much love that I'm willing to share, alright, yeah <eos> I've got it right here <eos> So many things that I'm trying to do right <eos> Trying to make friends <eos> But everyone wanna fight <eos> Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> Working from early in the morning <eos> Up until the edge of night <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> I've been so many places <eos> City from town to town <eos> Looking for a real good woman <eos> They all seem to turn me down <eos> I'm looking for a Louisiana girl <eos> To put into my placе <eos> So when I wake up in the morning <eos> Thеre'd be a smile on her face <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Ooh, belong <eos> And I'll tell you one more thing <eos> I'm used to dealing with doubt <eos> Should I be in the big city? <eos> You know my money's running out <eos> Cost too much for a hamburger <eos> And they want too much for fries <eos> You better not talk to the big leg woman <eos> 'Cause they want too much for the thigh <eos> I guess I'll go back home, yeah, go back home <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Oh, going home, take it home now <eos> 
Could've been the way <eos> The moonlight hit the dashboard <eos> Passenger window rolled down <eos> That got me thinking <eos> There's something we should talk about <eos> It's not worth waiting out <eos> I can give you space if you need it <eos> You can walk away, I'm not leaving <eos> There's pride in my mouth, I got used to the taste <eos> But I'll swallow it now and I'll be first to say <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos> We could both play the pretender <eos> Circling round this parking lot <eos> While one of us still remembers <eos> We're lucky to have what we've got <eos> We're taking the room for breathing <eos> You can walk away, I'm not leaving <eos> There's pride in your mouth, you got used to the taste <eos> Can you swallow it now when you hear me say <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos>

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> When that sun is high in that Texas sky <eos> I'll be bucking at the county fair <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there <eos> They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe <eos> Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way <eos> Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate <eos> And I hope that judge ain't blind <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind <eos> Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine <eos> I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> 
I looked to my arms <eos> And my legs <eos> And my head <eos> And my chest <eos> And I said that I'm okay <eos> No more thoughts of regret <eos> They're purely electrical signals <eos> So I might've flicked a switch <eos> Oh <eos> It's time to relax <eos> Have a snack and <eos> Walk to the river <eos> Noticed how it is bigger than all of this <eos> You were someone <eos> I met on the internet <eos> Not tonight <eos> You are real <eos> What a rush <eos> What a feel <eos> Take you out on a date <eos> And pretend that were making a ten point <eos> Series about our mistakes <eos> Time to relax <eos> Oh we're both kinda lightweight so <eos> We went for dinner <eos> Hanging with you is different to everything <eos> Wow <eos> 
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me <eos> You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy <eos> There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you <eos> You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you <eos> I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you <eos> How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you <eos> You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in <eos> That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much <eos> Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started <eos> I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted <eos> Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding <eos> Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing <eos> Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar <eos> I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler <eos> Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning <eos> We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> And I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos>

Ah, aha <eos> Ooh, ohh <eos> Ohh <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Once bitten and twice shy <eos> I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye <eos> Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? <eos> Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me <eos> "Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it <eos> With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it <eos> Now I know what a fool I've been <eos> But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh) <eos> Oh, oh, baby <eos> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes <eos> I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice <eos> My God, I thought you were someone to rely on <eos> Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on <eos> A face of a lover with a fire in his heart <eos> A man under cover but you tore me apart <eos> Ooh-hoo <eos> Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart) <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears (Ohh) <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> A face of a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart) <eos> A man under cover but you tore him apart <eos> Maybe next year <eos> I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special <eos> Special... <eos> Someone... <eos>

August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> I wish I could make it easy <eos> Easy to love me, love me <eos> But still I reach, to find a way <eos> I'm stuck here in between <eos> I'm looking for the right words to say <eos> I'm slowly drifting, drifting away <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave <eos> 
(Do you believe?) Walk on water <eos> Can you even see what you're fighting for? <eos> Blood lust and a holy war <eos> Listen up, hear the patriot shout: <eos> "Times are changing" <eos> In the end, the choice was clear <eos> Take a shot in the face of fear <eos> Fist up in the firing line <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> (Do you believe?) <eos> Look at the sky, see a dying star <eos> White lies, it's a man on fire <eos> Making love with the devil hurts <eos> Times are changing <eos> A thin line, the whole truth <eos> The far right, the left view <eos> Breaking all those promises made <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe?

I don't need you to love me, I can't be broken twice <eos> Just tell me I'm beautiful as we lie down, that will suffice <eos> Don't look so guilty as though you've done me wrong <eos> I'm not your victim to be pitied <eos> I'm not yours at all for long <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Ahh Ahhh <eos> But you kissed me too softly and then I felt used <eos> You told me I was there, your call to arms your muse <eos> Don't act so bewitched as though you tried to stay true <eos> Did I enchant you with my voice, was it my hair that maddened you? <eos> Such excuses are heard only in songs <eos> From a time before you and I <eos> There is no great romance here, no <eos> Just a lust you tried to glorify <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> Oooh ooh ooh <eos> I'll never let you hurt me, I'll never let you in <eos> A fool was I to indulge in such sordid dealings <eos> I won't let this bruise me, the choice is my own <eos> Not to let another use me and learn to be alone <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> 
Se le respeta, del señor de Culiacán carga la camiseta <eos> Los radios sonando, siempre se ponen alerta <eos> Rugen los motores y también las metralletas <eos> Todos sus muchachos firmes, fieles a la empresa <eos> Ya saben que lo que se usa aquí es la cabeza <eos> No me espanto del gobierno ni de la pobreza <eos> Y los que la deben no se acercan, nomás rezan <eos> Y lloran en el panteón <eos> Al tiro por 'onde anda, pues él es el que manda <eos> Nadie lo baja del puesto y para ser honesto <eos> Se ganó el respeto, oh-oh <eos> Y conserva su puesto, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> En el carro va contando <eos> Pacas de las verdes es la' que va duplicando <eos> Y el que juega a traición él se lo lleva de encargo <eos> Y en la lista negra su nombre voy agregando <eos> Llenas las cuentas <eos> Conectados con los grandes mandando libretas <eos> Se les nota el porte que el muchacho representa <eos> Y el jale es calidad, por eso aumentan las ventas <eos> Si es porque él así lo decidió <eos> Compa Dan <eos> Y puros corridos tumbados, viejones <eos> Así nomás, mi compa Nata <eos> Ya sabe cómo es el rollo <eos> Su compa Oscar Maydon <eos> Representando la bandera <eos> Y puro Morales viejo, ¡eah! <eos> En camionetas blindadas, las rápidas se vieron por la sierra <eos> .50 montados, equipados pa' dar guerra <eos> Hombres listos que prefieren quedar bajo tierra <eos> Antes de fallar una misión <eos> Bien al cien con la plebada, pues no pasa nada <eos> Mandando kilos de la verde y también de lavada <eos> Todos bien activos para cualquier situación <eos> Con los radios en las manos para entrar en acción <eos> Todo está al cien con los viejos <eos> Aquí nada corre chueco, todo camina derecho <eos> Y una santa que lo cuida y esa la cuelga en el pecho <eos> La confianza me he ganado y eso lo hicieron mis hechos <eos> Ya con esta me despido <eos> Y ando cuidando el terreno y ese nunca lo descuido <eos> Culiacán, esta es mi casa, mi Sinaloa tan querido <eos> Donde tengo buen respaldo de mis más grandes amigos <eos>

Goin' down like a sunset <eos> Burnin' out like a cigarette <eos> Blowin' through the cash, through the past <eos> Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left <eos> I could go on and on <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> I could drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> Trying to ride out the midnight <eos> Trying to fight through the daylight <eos> Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that <eos> I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> 
We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But I'm always looking forward for an open door <eos> I found an outlet for all my feelings <eos> They're trying to cut the cord <eos> I'm thinking we've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But there's always a place for you here in my wild heart <eos> I dream of you on a highway under a thousand stars <eos> We can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> We can have it all <eos> I can make it on my own <eos> We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> And you can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> 
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining <eos> It's the night of our dear Savior's birth <eos> Long lay the world in sin and error pining <eos> 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth <eos> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <eos> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn <eos> Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices! <eos> O night divine, O night when Christ was born <eos> O night divine, O night divine! <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> 
I wish we could cut all ties with the morning light <eos> Because our secret’s in the dark <eos> And though I don’t take it to heart <eos> I just need more time <eos> To appreciate what we’ll leave behind <eos> Like the feeling when you’re holding me still with your eyes <eos> It’s as real as the stars that freckle the sky <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> And all of the light we’re missing <eos> Thanks to the sun’s indifference <eos> Oh limited time is hard to survive <eos> With no sacrifice <eos> But conversation’s flowing <eos> Further than every ocean <eos> Oh please tell me why <eos> Please tell me why <eos> This feels so right <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Lets just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine, we’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> 
Sitting in a park in Paris, France <eos> Reading the news and it sure looks bad <eos> They won't give peace a chance <eos> That was just a dream some of us had <eos> Still a lot of lands to see <eos> But I wouldn't wanna stay here <eos> It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here <eos> Oh, but California <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> I'm going to see the folks I dig <eos> I'll even kiss a Sunset pig <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> I met a redneck on a Grecian isle <eos> Who did the goat dance very well <eos> He gave me back my smile <eos> But he kept my camera to sell <eos> Oh, the rogue, the red red rogue <eos> He cooked good omelets and stews <eos> And I might have stayed on with him there <eos> But my heart cried out for you, California <eos> Oh, California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band <eos> I'm your biggest fan <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, it gets so lonely <eos> When you're walking <eos> And the streets are full of strangers <eos> All the news of home you read <eos> Just gives you the blues <eos> Just gives you the blues <eos> So I bought me a ticket <eos> I got on a plane to Spain <eos> Went to a party down a red dirt road <eos> There were lots of pretty people there <eos> Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue <eos> They said, "How long can you hang around?" <eos> I said a week, maybe two <eos> Just until my skin turns brown <eos> Then I'm going home to California <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, will you take me as I am <eos> Strung out on another man <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, it gets so lonely <eos> When you're walking <eos> And the streets are full of strangers <eos> All the news of home you read <eos> More about the war <eos> And the bloody changes <eos> Oh, will you take me as I am? <eos> Will you take me as I am? <eos> Will you? <eos> Will you take me as I am? <eos> Hmmm mmmmm <eos> Take me as I am <eos>

It's a mystery to me <eos> We have a greed, with which we have agreed <eos> You think you have to want more than you need <eos> Until you have it all, you won't be free <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> When you want more than you have, you think you need <eos> And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed <eos> I think I need to find a bigger place <eos> 'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> There's those thinking more or less less is more <eos> But if less is more how you keeping score? <eos> Means for every point you make your level drops <eos> Kinda like you're starting from the top <eos> And you can't do that <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, have mercy on me <eos> I hope you're not angry if I disagree <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely, without me <eos> 
When I was fourteen I was fallin' fast <eos> For a blue-eyed girl in my homeroom class <eos> Tryin to find the courage to ask her out <eos> Was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout <eos> What she would've said, I can't say <eos> I never did ask then she moved away <eos> I learned something from my blue-eyed girl <eos> Sink or swim, you gotta give it a whirl <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> The longer I live the more I believe <eos> You do have to give if you wanna receive <eos> There's a time to listen, a time to talk <eos> And you might have to crawl even after you walk <eos> Had sure things blow up in my face <eos> Seen the long-shot win the race <eos> Been knocked down by the slammin' door <eos> Picked myself up and came back for more <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Take a chance on love <eos> Life's a dance <eos> You learn as you go <eos>

The First Noel, the angels did say <eos> Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay <eos> In fields where they lay keeping their sheep <eos> On a cold winter's night that was so deep <eos> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel <eos> Born is the King of Israel <eos> They looked above and saw a star <eos> Shining in the east beyond them far <eos> And to the earth it gave great light <eos> And so it continued both day and night <eos> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel <eos> Born is the King of Israel <eos> 
You and I, baby <eos> Maybe we can ride away, baby <eos> And I just wanna get inside, baby <eos> But I don't wanna wait forever <eos> Scared that I can't treat you better than her <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don’t overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it's just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah <eos> I wanna know <eos> I wanna know how to feel, what to feel, what's right <eos> I never know <eos> 'Cause when it gets real, I just run away and hide from you <eos> From you <eos> From you, ooh, ooh <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don't overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it’s just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?

Tanto tiempo disfrutamos <eos> Este amor <eos> Nuestras almas se acercaron <eos> Tanto así <eos> Que yo guardo tu sabor <eos> Pero tú llevas también <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Si negaras mi presencia en tu vivir <eos> Bastaría con abrazarme y conversar <eos> Tanta vida yo te dí <eos> Que por fuerza llevas ya <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> No pretendo ser tu dueño <eos> No soy nada <eos> Yo no tengo vanidad <eos> De mi vida doy lo bueno <eos> Soy tan pobre que otra cosa puedo dar <eos> Pasarán más de mil años <eos> Muchos más <eos> Puedo hacer que tenga amor la inmensidad <eos> Pero allá tal como aquí <eos> En la boca llevarás <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> No pretendo ser tu dueño <eos> No soy nada <eos> Yo no tengo vanidad <eos> De mi vida doy lo bueno <eos> Soy tan pobre que otra cosa puedo dar <eos> Pasarán más de mil años <eos> Muchos más <eos> Puedo hacer que tenga amor la inmensidad <eos> Pero allá tal como aquí <eos> En la boca llevarás <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> 
Like Elvis, like everyone <eos> We all die, we all live on in photos <eos> And paperbacks, if we're lucky <eos> We're coming back <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos> We notice <eos> We understand <eos> We throw out all we can <eos> We're on the market, we're up on racks <eos> If we're really lucky we're coming back <eos> I would never decide <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos>

Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos> 
I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz <eos> When an old friend I happened to see <eos> I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing <eos> My friend stole my sweetheart from me <eos> I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz <eos> Only you know how much I have lost <eos> Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing <eos> That beautiful Tennessee Waltz <eos> I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz <eos> When an old friend I happened to see <eos> I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing <eos> My friend stole my sweetheart from me <eos> I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz <eos> Only you know how much I have lost <eos> Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing <eos> That beautiful Tennessee Waltz <eos> 
There was a time <eos> When I was so broken hearted <eos> Love wasn't much of a friend of mine <eos> The tables have turned, yeah <eos> 'Cause me and them ways have parted <eos> That kind of love was the killin' kind <eos> Now listen <eos> All I want is someone I can't resist <eos> I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm trying to forget you <eos> Love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dying 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do down on me <eos> Now there's not even breathing room <eos> Between pleasure and pain <eos> Yeah, you cry when we're making love <eos> Must be one and the same <eos> It's down on me <eos> Yeah I got to tell you one thing <eos> It's been on my mind <eos> Girl, I gotta say <eos> We're partners in crime <eos> You got that certain something <eos> What you give to me <eos> Takes my breath away <eos> Now the word out on the street <eos> Is the devil's in your kiss <eos> If our love goes up in flames <eos> It's a fire I can't resist <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm trying to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dying 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do to me <eos> 'Cause what you got inside <eos> Ain't where your love should stay <eos> Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love <eos> 'Til you give your heart away <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm tryin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dyin' to let you <eos> Do what you do what you do down to me <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm tryin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm dyin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos>

As I undressed in my apartment, empty-hearted <eos> Did you remember how we made it without a sound? <eos> And with all the vapor that you brought in <eos> And you never even let me hit the ground <eos> You still never make a sound in the air <eos> But you never made a downpour in the sky <eos> And the window clears as my tears pouring down <eos> We could never rain as one on empty houses <eos> It would downpour back to town with deafening sound <eos> It would clean the insides inside-out <eos> You never made a cloud float in the air <eos> But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile <eos> The time you put has made a wound <eos> It's just a wound it leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos>

I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I see a line of cars and they're all painted black <eos> With flowers and my love, both never to come back <eos> I see people turn their heads and quickly look away <eos> Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day <eos> I look inside myself and see my heart is black <eos> I see my red door, I must have it painted black <eos> Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts <eos> It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black <eos> No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue <eos> I could not foresee this thing happening to you <eos> If I look hard enough into the setting sun <eos> My love will laugh with me before the morning comes <eos> I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted black <eos> Black as night, black as coal <eos> I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black <eos> Yeah <eos> 
Heart beats fast <eos> Colors and promises <eos> How to be brave <eos> How can I love when I'm afraid to fall? <eos> But watching you stand alone <eos> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> Time stands still <eos> Beauty in all she is <eos> I will be brave <eos> I will not let anything take away <eos> What's standing in front of me <eos> Every breath <eos> Every hour has come to this <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> One step closer <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos>

L'amour, l'amour, l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> À l'amour, c'est un printemps craintif <eos> Une lumière attendrie, ou souvent une ruine <eos> L'amour, l'amour, c'est le poivre du temps <eos> Une rafale de vent, une feuillée de lune <eos> L'amour, l'amour, à l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> L'amour, mais la nuit a un bonnet <eos> Et le jour porte un masque <eos> Qui veulent que l'on grimace <eos> L'amour, l'amour <eos> C'est parfois même aussi, que le visage d'un autre <eos> Qui n'est ni lui ni l'autre <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour, à l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour c'est plus d'une fois <eos> Un panier vide aux bras l'arc-en-ciel sur deux coeurs <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour <eos> À l'amour c'est quand je t'aime <eos> À l'amour c'est quand tu m'aimes <eos> Sans me le dire <eos> Sans te le dire <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour <eos> L'amour c'est quand tu m'aimes <eos> L'amour c'est quand je t'aime <eos> Sans te le dire <eos> Sans me le dire <eos>

Joy has dawned upon the world <eos> Promised from creation— <eos> God’s salvation now unfurled <eos> Hope for ev’ry nation <eos> Not with fanfares from above <eos> Not with scenes of glory <eos> But a humble gift of love— <eos> Jesus born of Mary <eos> Sounds of wonder fill the sky <eos> With the songs of angels <eos> As the mighty Prince of Life <eos> Shelters in a stable <eos> Hands that set each star in place <eos> Shaped the earth in darkness <eos> Cling now to a mother’s breast <eos> Vuln’rable and helpless <eos> Shepherds bow before the Lamb <eos> Gazing at the glory; <eos> Gifts of men from distant lands <eos> Prophesy the story <eos> Gold—a King is born today <eos> Incense—God is with us <eos> Myrrh—His death will make a way <eos> And by His blood He’ll win us <eos> Son of Adam, Son of heaven <eos> Given as a ransom; <eos> Reconciling God and man <eos> Christ, our mighty champion! <eos> What a Savior! What a Friend! <eos> What a glorious myst’ry! <eos> Once a babe in Bethlehem <eos> Now the Lord of hist’ry <eos> 

Two young people without a thing <eos> Say some vows and spread their wings <eos> And settle down with just what they need <eos> Livin' on love <eos> She don't care 'bout what's in style <eos> She just likes the way he smiles <eos> It takes more than marble and tile <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Two old people without a thing <eos> Children gone but still they sing <eos> Side by side in that front porch swing <eos> Livin' on love <eos> He can't see anymore <eos> She can barely sweep the floor <eos> Hand in hand they'll walk through that door <eos> Just livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> But, it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> No it doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> 
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance <eos> They're looking for a little romance <eos> Given half a chance <eos> And I have never seen that dress you're wearing <eos> Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes <eos> I have been blind <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> But I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> You were amazing <eos> I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side <eos> And when you turned to me and smiled <eos> It took my breath away <eos> And I have never had such a feeling <eos> Such a feeling of complete and utter love <eos> As I do tonight <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> Well, I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I never will forget the way you look tonight <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> My lady in red <eos> I love you <eos> 
Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> At the Christmas party hop <eos> Mistletoe hung where you can see <eos> Everybody tries to stop <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Let the Christmas spirit ring <eos> Later we'll have some pumpkin pie <eos> And we'll do some caroling <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with bows of holly <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashion way <eos> (This song shares with Jingle Bell Rock so…) <eos> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring <eos> Snowing and blowing, have bushels of fun <eos> That's the jingle bell rock, rock, rock <eos> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <eos> Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square <eos> In the frosty air <eos> What a bright time, it's the right time <eos> To rock the night away <eos> Jingle bell time is a swell time <eos> To go gliding in a one horse sleigh <eos> Giddiup jingle horse, pick up your feet <eos> Jingle around the clock <eos> Mix and mingle in the jingling beat <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> Mix and mingle in the jingling beat <eos> That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> 
They said I needed something in my life <eos> Said I was doing dumb shit all the time <eos> 'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all <eos> I heard it was the wrong things I get right <eos> I blame it on the monsters in my mind <eos> With stories from outside these prison walls <eos> 'Cause even if we're hopeless <eos> And we know that this will hurt <eos> Tomorrow is just a word <eos> And they can't control <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Believers <eos> So incomplete, yet all we need <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> I said I wouldn't run but I'm terrified <eos> Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights <eos> So you and me go falling through the dark <eos> You told me be someone that I like <eos> Instead of being someone in their eyes <eos> Your battle scars make you look like a star <eos> 'Cause even if we're hopeless <eos> And we know that this will hurt <eos> Tomorrow is just a word <eos> And they can't control <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Believers <eos> So incomplete, yet all we need <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> No they can’t control <eos> 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me <eos> I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream) <eos> Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why <eos> Without you, it's hard to survive <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky <eos> They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry) <eos> The good and the bad times, we've been through them all <eos> You make me rise when I fall <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style <eos> In the air there's a feeling of Christmas <eos> Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile <eos> And on every street corner you hear <eos> Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells) <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> (Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green) <eos> As the shoppers rush home with their treasures <eos> (Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene) <eos> And above all this bustle you hear <eos> (Silver bells) Silver bells, (Silver bells) silver bells <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> Silver bells, silver bells, silver, silver bells <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos> 
El vino es mejor en tu boca <eos> Te amo es más tierno en tu voz <eos> La noche en tu cuerpo es más corta <eos> Me estoy enfermando de amor... <eos> Quisiera caminar en tu pelo <eos> Quisiera ser noche en tu piel <eos> Pensar que fue todo un sueño <eos> Después descubrirte otra vez... <eos> Y amarte como yo lo haría <eos> Como un hombre a una mujer <eos> Tenerte como cosa mía <eos> Y no podérmelo creer... <eos> Tan mía, mía, mía, mía <eos> Que eres parte de mi piel <eos> Conocerte fue mi suerte <eos> Amarte es un placer, mujer... <eos> Quisiera beber de tu pecho <eos> La miel del amanecer <eos> Mis dedos buscando senderos <eos> Llegar al final de tu ser <eos> Bailar el vals de las olas <eos> Cuerpo a cuerpo tu y yo <eos> Fundirme contigo en las sombras <eos> Y hacerte un poema de amor... <eos> Y amarte como yo lo haría <eos> Como un hombre a una mujer <eos> Tenerte como cosa mía <eos> Y no podérmelo creer... <eos> Tan mía, mía, mía, mía <eos> Que eres parte de mi piel <eos> Conocerte fue mi suerte <eos> Amarte es un placer, mujer... <eos> 
I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own bedsheets <eos> I've been waking up alone, I haven't thought of her for days <eos> I'll be honest, it's better off this way <eos> But every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been tryin' but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remembеr you're gone, baby, it's just the song on thе radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own white tee <eos> I've been waking up alone <eos> I haven't thought of him for days <eos> I'll be honest <eos> It's better off this way <eos> Every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> And I've been trying but I just can't fight it (Ooh) <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling (Ooh) <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> 
Le gusta salir y amanecer <eos> Beber y enloquecerse <eos> Y cuando el día termine <eos> No sé si la vuelvo a ver <eos> Yo que no traje bloqueador pa' tanto calor que quema <eos> Y ese cuerpito que tú tiene', el traje 'e baño chiquitito te queda <eos> Esa blanquita coge sol y de una ya se pone morena <eos> Un trago en mano, bien borracha, todos saben que su vida es extrema <eos> Dice que no, pero sé que mi flow le corre por las vena' <eos> Y ese cuerpito que tú tiene', el traje 'e baño chiquitito te queda <eos> Esa blanquita coge sol y de una ya se pone morena <eos> Un trago en mano, bien borracha, todos saben que su vida es extrema <eos> Dice que no, pero sé que mi flow le corre por las vena' <eos> Leggo <eos> Mami, sacúdete la arena <eos> Con ese booty me duele que seas ajena, ey (Ajena) <eos> Se puso una de mis cadena' <eos> Nunca le baja, siempre con la copa llena (Wuh) <eos> Ella entró, saludó y en el bote se montó <eos> Dos cachas y tosió cuando Sky se lo pasó (Yah) <eos> Me pegué, lo meneó, nunca me dijo que no <eos> Se lució, abusó, y eso que ni se esforzó (Ey) <eos> Yo que no traje bloqueador pa' tanto calor que quema <eos> Y ese cuerpito que tú tiene', el traje 'e baño chiquitito te queda (Woh) <eos> Esa blanquita coge sol y de una ya se pone morena (Ah) <eos> Un trago en mano, bien borracha, todos saben que su vida es extrema <eos> Dice que no, pero sé que mi flow le corre por las vena' (Ah-ah) <eos> Con tu cuerpo sube la marea (Marea) <eos> En traje 'e baño, bobo me deja (Uff) <eos> A lo Yankee, estás dura (Yeah) <eos> Como Maluma, pa' que suba la temperatura (Yah) <eos> Hace calor (Calor, calor), hace calor (Eh) <eos> Por tu cuerpo baja tu sudor (Wuh) <eos> Toma aguardiente y lo pasa con ron (Ron) <eos> Si no es bikini, ropa interior (Wuh) <eos> Cuando la vi yo le dije cómo fue (Cómo fue) <eos> Abajo 'el yate fue que la pillé (La pillé) <eos> Está loca y de todo prueba <eos> Y ese cuerpito que tú tiene', el traje 'e baño chiquitito te queda (Woh) <eos> Esa blanquita coge sol y de una ya se pone morena (Ah) <eos> Un trago en mano, bien borracha, todos saben que su vida es extrema <eos> Dice que no, pero sé que mi flow le corre por las vena' (Ah-ah) <eos> Y ese cuerpito que tú tiene', el traje 'e baño chiquitito te queda (Ey, ey) <eos> Esa blanquita coge sol y de una ya se pone morena (Ey, ey) <eos> Un trago en mano, bien borracha, todos saben que su vida es extrema <eos> Dice que no, pero sé que mi flow le corre por las vena' <eos> Yeah-yeah <eos> Yeah-yeah <eos> 
One night to be confused <eos> One night to speed up truth <eos> We had a promise made <eos> Four hands and then away <eos> Both under influence <eos> We had divine sense <eos> To know what to say <eos> Mind is a razor blade <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> One night of magic rush <eos> The start a simple touch <eos> One night to push and scream <eos> And then relief <eos> Ten days of perfect hues <eos> The colors red and blue <eos> We had a promise made <eos> We were in love <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> And you, you knew the hand of the devil <eos> And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth <eos> Sharing different heartbeats <eos> In one night <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> 
Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie <eos> Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre supe aceptarme <eos> De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores <eos> Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí <eos> Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel <eos> Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte <eos> Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me alejé y en cambio quise <eos> Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas <eos> Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia; <eos> Y siempre me estoy imaginando <eos> Las veces que él te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos <eos> Me muero de envidia <eos> Envidia, queriendo ser luna en la noche <eos> Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche <eos> Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre <eos> Y amarte hasta que se te olvide... su nombre <eos> Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad <eos> El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena <eos> Que será mi condena... que me va a matar <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Ay me muero de envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia y te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> No sé lo que me pasa, esta maldita envidia <eos> Que va a acabar conmigo yo lo sé, si no te hago mía <eos> Va contra mis principios mi moral, querer amar a una mujer que es ajena <eos> Vivir así no puedo más, en esta agonía <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> Te digo no puedo más <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> No puedo, no puedo más <eos> 
Me muero por robarte un beso <eos> Y porque pierda la razón <eos> Tal vez asi me atrevería <eos> Y pierda miedo el corazón <eos> Me muero por amar despacio <eos> La prisa no nos debe apurar <eos> Ya sabes que la vida es un viaje <eos> Y yo lo quiero disfrutar <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Me muero por cruzar el tiempo <eos> Si el alma no se puede ver <eos> Qué pasa si se va la vida <eos> O tal vez solo un recuerdo es <eos> Por eso si el recuerdo queda <eos> Que quede la memoria llena <eos> La quiero saturar por contemplar <eos> Tus ojos y una luna llena <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti, por ti <eos> Me muero por vivir contigo <eos> Lo que me queda por andar <eos> Pedirle a dios que cambie el tiempo <eos> Y que lo vuelta eternidad <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si yo me muero <eos> Muero de amor, por ti <eos> 
I was born long ago <eos> I am the chosen I'm the one <eos> I have come to save the day <eos> And I won't leave until I'm done <eos> So that's why you've got to try <eos> You got to breathe and have some fun <eos> Though I'm not paid I play this game <eos> And I won't stop until I'm done <eos> But what I really want to know is <eos> Are you going to go my way ? <eos> And I got to, got to know <eos> I don't know why we always cry <eos> This we must leave and get undone <eos> We must engage and rearrange <eos> And turn this planet back to one <eos> So tell me why we got to die <eos> And kill each other one by one <eos> We've got to hug and rub-a-dub <eos> We've got to dance and be in love <eos> But what I really want to know is <eos> Are you going to go my way ? <eos> And I got to, got to know <eos> Are you going to go my way? <eos> Because baby I got to know, yeah <eos> 
Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos> Sun dress on the front steps <eos> Sun up by the lake <eos> Blanket down in the backyard <eos> Lying wide awake <eos> That's a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Moonlight on the back seat <eos> A breeze through the wires <eos> Springsteen on the speakers <eos> Girl, I'm on fire <eos> That's stuff I don't think about <eos> 'Cause it still kills me now <eos> I still can't dance around <eos> That memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> It's good running into you like this <eos> But, girl, I'm close as I can get <eos> To a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos>

Trying to find a new home <eos> Trying to write a new song <eos> Trying to find a rhythm, that’ll help me <eos> Ooh, wanna get through it <eos> Hmm, keep singing the blues <eos> Everybody’s saying: <eos> “You gotta get a way in! <eos> Go deal with the real stuff” <eos> And I-I-I, it’s gotta be true enough <eos> Yeah, keep singing the blues <eos> Well, you know?!

And with the early dawn moving right along <eos> I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep <eos> And in the aching night under satellites <eos> I was not received <eos> Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart <eos> Someone get me a priest <eos> To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head <eos> Is this a cure or is this a disease? <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in the after birth on the quiet earth <eos> Let the stains remind you <eos> You thought you made a man, you better think again <eos> Before my role defines you <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in your waiting hands, I will land <eos> And roll out of my skin <eos> And in your final hours, I will stand <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos>

Clone, <eos> caught hold of your flood lung, <eos> harbour your ‘someone’, <eos> prevent me. <eos> Shown, <eos> you swoon in your lace run, <eos> brooding, a quilt tongue, <eos> pining me. <eos> Calm, <eos> clot, cold, and bleed <eos> Bone, <eos> pull over your midriff, <eos> labour your inches, <eos> widow me. <eos> Hone, <eos> all crimson and hinges, <eos> tarot and itches, <eos> corner me. <eos> Faux <eos> shot, sold and bleed <eos> cower all your cinders, fake us <eos> bower in your shivers, shake us. <eos>

Think about it, there must be higher love <eos> Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above <eos> Without it, life is wasted time <eos> Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on <eos> Facing our fear and standing out there alone <eos> A yearning and it's real to me <eos> There must be someone who's feeling for me <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> A good kind of love, want a higher love <eos> I will wait for it <eos> I'm not too late for it <eos> Until then, I'll sing my song <eos> To cheer the night along <eos> Bring it, oh <eos> I could light the night up with my soul on fire <eos> I could make the sun shine from pure desire <eos> Let me feel that love come over me <eos> Let me feel how strong it could be <eos> Oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh I said bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> 
Don't go tonight <eos> Stay here one more time <eos> Remind me what it's like <eos> And let's fall in love one more time <eos> I need you now by my side <eos> It tears me up when you turn me down <eos> I'm begging please, just stick around <eos> I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me <eos> I know that your love is gone <eos> I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy <eos> Don't tell me that your love is gone <eos> That your love is gone <eos> Don't tell me that your love is gone <eos> That your love is gone <eos> I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me <eos> I know that your love is gone <eos> I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy <eos> Don't tell me that your love is gone <eos> That your love is gone <eos> That your love is gone, hmm <eos> I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy <eos> Don't tell me that your love is gone <eos> That your love is gone <eos> 
Oh, what a night <eos> Late December, back in '63 <eos> What a very special time for me <eos> As I remember, what a night <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> You know, I didn't even know her name <eos> But I was never gonna be the same <eos> What a lady, what a night <eos> Oh, I <eos> I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room <eos> And I <eos> As I recall, it ended much too soon <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me <eos> She was everything I dreamed she'd be <eos> Sweet surrender, what a night <eos> And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder <eos> Spinning my head around <eos> And takin' my body under <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Oh, I <eos> I got a funny feeling <eos> When she walked in the room <eos> And I <eos> As I recall, it ended much too soon <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Why'd it take so long to see the light? <eos> Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right <eos> What a lady, what a night <eos> Oh <eos> And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder <eos> Spinning my head around <eos> And takin' my body under <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> 
Je ne rêve plus, je ne fume plus, je n'ai même plus d'histoire <eos> Je suis sale sans toi, je suis laid sans toi <eos> Je suis comme un orphelin dans un dortoir <eos> Je n'ai plus envie de vivre ma vie, ma vie cesse quand tu pars <eos> Je n'ai plus de vie et même mon lit <eos> Se transforme en quai de gare quand tu t'en vas <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> T'arrives on ne sait jamais quand, tu r'pars on ne sait jamais où <eos> Et ça va faire bientôt deux ans que tu t'en fous <eos> Comme à un rocher, comme à un péché, je suis accroché à toi <eos> Je suis fatigué, je suis épuisé <eos> De faire semblant d'être heureux quand ils sont là <eos> Je bois toutes les nuits mais tous les whiskys, pour moi, ont le même goût <eos> Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau <eos> Je ne sais plus où aller, tu es partout <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Je verse mon sang dans ton corps <eos> Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi, tu dors <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Pourtant, moi, j'avais du talent avant ta peau <eos> Cet amour me tue, si ça continue, je crèverai seul avec moi <eos> Près de ma radio, comme un gosse idiot <eos> Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, c'est ça, je suis malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Et j'ai le cœur complètement malade <eos> Cerné de barricades, t'entends ? Je suis malade ! <eos> 
We're waiting for collapse <eos> In the cold and lonely mirror <eos> Reflections all you see <eos> Of the world you made on your own with no mercy <eos> And they call you a liar <eos> But you won't surrender <eos> And they can choose to run <eos> With hypocrisy <eos> It happens every day <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> The revolution lives <eos> In the beat of our hearts and the burning sound of the flames we started in <eos> Can you hear it now? Can you feel the hurt? <eos> This silent hate <eos> And they worship a liar <eos> But we won't surrender <eos> And we won't ever run <eos> From the pain you see <eos> Because now we're free <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> 
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit <eos> Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it <eos> But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life <eos> Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Oh, no, no, no <eos> All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound <eos> One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you <eos> And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain <eos> And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no <eos> Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no <eos> Can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me <eos> Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over <eos> (There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no <eos>

Hallé una flor un día en el camino <eos> Que apareció marchita y deshojada <eos> Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro <eos> Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla <eos> Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos <eos> A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma <eos> Recuperó el color que había perdido <eos> Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que nadie le robe el color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas <eos> Nació el amor que un día se había perdido <eos> Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra <eos> Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que siempre este cerca de mí <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Le fui brindando cariño, un poquito de amor <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Y en el invierno llenó mi jardín de color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Ay, cuando la vi, me enamoré y me la llevé, me la llevé <eos> ¡Avemaría! <eos> ¡Puerto Rico! <eos> Jajaja <eos> ¡Ataca, Sergio <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> ¡Esto sigue! <eos> 
Who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> And who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> Who can say why your heart sighs <eos> As your love flies? Only time <eos> And who can say why your heart cries <eos> When your love lies? Only time <eos> Who can say when the roads meet? <eos> That love might be in your heart? <eos> And who can say when the day sleeps <eos> If the night keeps all your heart? <eos> Night keeps all your heart <eos> Who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> And who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos>

Oh this perfume, must be something sacred <eos> To linger after you, like it do <eos> This scent's been buried where I rest my head <eos> Pretend to forget but it still feels like you <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Sleep much longer than I did before <eos> Though haunted are dreams evermore <eos> Bless these angels hanging over my head <eos> Still as a tomb though, I'm scared instead <eos> ('Cause) <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Oh you left so much behind <eos> I must be losing my mind, Oh <eos> 
We've been to both Carolinas <eos> Seen a big Montana sky <eos> Driven up and down a coast a few times <eos> London, Paris, paradise <eos> But ain't got much memory of the scenes <eos> Come to think, I miss them all <eos> And damn, babe, it's all your fault <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach? <eos> You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea <eos> And the night rolled in <eos> And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall <eos> But God, I saw all I needed to <eos> Might as well have stayed in the room <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Don't you remember Times Square? <eos> And people counting down everywhere <eos> 2000-whatever, no, I didn't care <eos> 'Cause baby you were there <eos> And once again, couldn't help but stare <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> Halfway around the world <eos> Or the local corner booth <eos> Yeah, you guessed it, girl <eos> You know I got my eyes on you <eos> We could be on any street <eos> Any party, any room <eos> I'll be there all night with my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> 
Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos>

Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree; <eos> And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud <eos> I can' t understand <eos> I get misty, just holding your hand <eos> Walk my way <eos> And a thousand violins begin to play <eos> Or it might be the sound of your hello <eos> That music I hear <eos> I get misty, the moment you're near <eos> You can say that you're leading me on <eos> But it's just what I want you to do <eos> Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost <eos> That's why I'm following you <eos> On my own <eos> Would I wander through this wonderland alone <eos> Never knowing my right foot from my left <eos> My hat from my glove <eos> I'm too misty, and too much in love <eos> I'm just too misty <eos> And too much <eos> In love..... <eos> 
It's a love thing, it's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing, thing) <eos> The look in your eyes is more than enough <eos> To make my poor heart burst into flames <eos> Before the moment we met <eos> That there was no doubt <eos> That my life would never be the same <eos> And I could never hide this feelin' <eos> That comes over me <eos> When you're near me <eos> I know that's how it's supposed to be <eos> My heart is tellin' me <eos> It's a love thing, yeah <eos> And the talkin' in my sleep <eos> About the love we made <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> Love thing <eos> (Thing) <eos> Such a feeling I get whenever we touch <eos> Girl, like no other I felt before <eos> It's still so new and yet I need you so much <eos> Got to make you mine forever more <eos> You're the kinda woman <eos> That can turn my world around <eos> 'Cause you showed me what <eos> Unselfish love is all about <eos> Without a doubt <eos> It's a love thing, yeah <eos> I feel that pounding in my heart <eos> When you call my name <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> Love thing <eos> (Thing) <eos> It's a love thing <eos> Every time that you're near <eos> It becomes so clear <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> Love thing <eos> (Thing) <eos> Yeah, it's a love thing <eos> I feel that pounding in my heart <eos> When you call my name <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> It's a love thing <eos> I could never hide this feeling <eos> That comes over me <eos> When you're near me <eos> I know that's how it's supposed to be <eos> My heart is tellin' me <eos> It's a love thing, yeah <eos> Got me talkin' in my sleep <eos> About the love we made <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> Ooh, it's a love thing <eos> (Thing) <eos> It's a love thing, yeah <eos> I feel that pounding in my heart <eos> Every time you call my name, yeah <eos> It's a love thing <eos> (It's a love thing) <eos> Love thing <eos> (Thing) <eos> Love thing <eos> It's a love thing <eos> It's a love thing <eos> It's a love thing <eos>

I hear the drums echoing tonight <eos> But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation <eos> She's coming in, 12:30 flight <eos> Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation <eos> I stopped an old man along the way <eos> Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies <eos> He turned to me as if to say <eos> "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> The wild dogs cry out in the night <eos> As they grow restless longing for some solitary company <eos> I know that I must do what's right <eos> As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti <eos> I seek to cure what's deep inside <eos> Frightened of this thing that I've become <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> 
Ooh, ooh, ah <eos> Oh woah <eos> Hmm, hmm <eos> Tell me how <eos> Are we supposed to still be talkin' every day <eos> When everything between us just completely changed? <eos> Oh, why? <eos> And tell me how <eos> Am I supposed to go ahead and just erase <eos> Every feeling, every memory we share? <eos> Oh, why? <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> So tell me how <eos> How could you tell me that you love me by mistake? <eos> Intoxicated, via texts, ain't you ashamed? <eos> That's so wild <eos> So how can I <eos> Believe or trust in anything that you say <eos> When you so easily regret it next day? <eos> See, that ain't right <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Ooh woah, ooh woah <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Ooh woah, ooh woah <eos> I know nobody's perfect <eos> And we are the way we are <eos> But you know I don't deserve this <eos> And I've waited way too long <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love <eos> Yeah I've been dying for your love, your love <eos> 
Mirandote a los ojos juraria <eos> Que tienes algo nuevo que contarme <eos> Empieza ya mujer no tengas miedo <eos> Quizá para mañana sea tarde <eos> Quizá para mañana sea tarde <eos> Y como es él <eos> En que lugar se enamoró de ti <eos> De donde es A qué dedica el tiempo libre <eos> Preguntale <eos> Por que ha robado un trozo de mi vida <eos> Es un ladrón Que me ha robado todo <eos> Arréglate mujer que se hace tarde <eos> Y llévate el paraguas por si llueve <eos> El estará esperando para amarte <eos> Y yo estaré celoso de perderte <eos> Y abrígate te sienta bien ese vestido gris <eos> Sonríete que no sospeche que has llorado <eos> Y dejame que vaya preparando tu equipaje <eos> Discúlpame Si te hago otra pregunta <eos>

Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos> 
Es diferente <eos> Esto no es normal, no está ni en mi mente <eos> Si tú me mientes <eos> Cuando tú me miras luego se siente <eos> Si quieres vete <eos> No te voy a parar cuando te alejes <eos> Simplemente tal vez yo no fui <eos> Al final yo perdí <eos> Traté de ser alguien que no fui <eos> Y es diferente, chiquita <eos> Puro Porte Diferente <eos> Dime qué sientes <eos> Si sientes algo igual, dilo de frente <eos> Ya no te pareces <eos> Estás cambiando y creo pa' siempre <eos> Ya muero por verte <eos> Ya no puedo aguantar de ser más fuerte <eos> Simplemente tal vez yo no fui <eos> Al final yo perdí <eos> Traté de ser alguien que no fui <eos>

Karma police, arrest this man <eos> He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge <eos> He's like a detuned radio <eos> Karma police, arrest this girl <eos> Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill <eos> And we have crashed her party <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> Karma police, I've given all I can <eos> It's not enough, I've given all I can <eos> But we're still on the payroll <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> 
I'm lost in the light <eos> I pray for the night <eos> To take me, to take you too <eos> After so many words <eos> Still nothing's heard <eos> Don't know what we should do <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> 'twas my greatest thrill <eos> When we just stood still <eos> You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill <eos> Even counting sheep <eos> Don't help me sleep <eos> I just toss and turn right there beside ya <eos> So if someone could help me now <eos> They'd help you too <eos> They'd help you too <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> And I held my own <eos> Still I rattled your bones <eos> I said some awful things and I take them back <eos> If we would try again <eos> Just remember when <eos> Before we were lovers I swear we were friends <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> Let them see you <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> 
Hooray it's Christmas time <eos> But there's one lousy tradition <eos> There's a certain show that you will see <eos> That is all and many would agree <eos> It is time to find another show to substitute <eos> For the Nutcracker <eos> I'm watching the game <eos> But something's wrong <eos> Staring is my wife <eos> Her face looks long <eos> I know that look, it must be me <eos> It's not our anniversary <eos> I shrug, no clue <eos> What did I do <eos> She stands in disbelief (What?) <eos> This holiday scene brings no laughter <eos> Forced going to see The Nutcracker <eos> I try to block it from my mind <eos> Think fast, what reason can I find? <eos> Got work to do, I'll fake the flu <eos> No chance, I'm done, I'm screwed (No!) <eos> I've seen the Nutcracker twenty times <eos> Sure it is fun if you are four (bum) <eos> Don't call me a Scrooge 'cause it's a bore <eos> The story's dated and that Mouse King thing <eos> Freaks me out (Ahh!) <eos> Well, guess I'm a guy, what can I say <eos> I'd rather watch football than ballet <eos> I try my hardest not to groan <eos> And pull the score up on my phone <eos> As I complain, "It's not the same" <eos> We're rushing out the door (Go!) <eos> All holiday shoppers on the road <eos> My holiday spirit might explode <eos> Of course, there is no place to park <eos> We're late, the theatre's in the dark <eos> In no small feat, we find a seat <eos> The show's about to start (Shh) <eos> Here's that song from Tetris <eos> And I know it's the part <eos> When I fight not to fall asleep <eos> March the wooden soldiers <eos> Bunch of mice start a fight <eos> Land of sweets, man this stuff's trippy <eos> By the way, this story makes no sense <eos> Still don't know what it means <eos> After all these years <eos> So confusing, feel like snoozing <eos> Eyes are heavy, as I start to dream <eos> Woah, I'm awake, must have fallen asleep <eos> Guess I didn't snore or make a peep <eos> 'Cause my wife had no clue I'd been out cold <eos> Is the finale coming up <eos> 'Cause there is no beer left in my cup <eos> To make it through, I'll need another drink <eos> Snuck out to the lobby <eos> Oh, look, I found a TV <eos> I forgot the game was happening <eos> It's down to the wire <eos> Time will soon expire <eos> Down by one, this kick would win it <eos> (Hut, hut) The ball snapped <eos> (Oh, no) The kick's bad <eos> (Wide right) No <eos> (We lost) No <eos> How could this night get any worse? <eos> Now I'm feeling all depressed <eos> But I still have to act impressed <eos> A pirouette, oh wow, that's great <eos> A six-year-old could do that, too <eos> Saw my team lose at the bar <eos> Now dancing dudes in leotards <eos> Last Nutcracker hopefully <eos> But my wife's thinking differently <eos> She leans in closely, whispers softly <eos> "Can't wait for you to take me next year." <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos> 
Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie <eos> Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre supe aceptarme <eos> De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores <eos> Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí <eos> Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel <eos> Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte <eos> Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me alejé y en cambio quise <eos> Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas <eos> Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia; <eos> Y siempre me estoy imaginando <eos> Las veces que él te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos <eos> Me muero de envidia <eos> Envidia, queriendo ser luna en la noche <eos> Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche <eos> Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre <eos> Y amarte hasta que se te olvide... su nombre <eos> Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad <eos> El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena <eos> Que será mi condena... que me va a matar <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Ay me muero de envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia y te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> No sé lo que me pasa, esta maldita envidia <eos> Que va a acabar conmigo yo lo sé, si no te hago mía <eos> Va contra mis principios mi moral, querer amar a una mujer que es ajena <eos> Vivir así no puedo más, en esta agonía <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> Te digo no puedo más <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> No puedo, no puedo más <eos> 
Tal vez te olvides de mi <eos> Tal vez me olvide de ti <eos> Pero esta vez aprendi <eos> Que no se debe mentir <eos> De una promesa vivi <eos> Hoy ya no puedo seguir <eos> Creyendo en ti <eos> Cada momento voy tropenzando <eos> En desamor <eos> Es que no queda nada entre tu y yo <eos> Si estoy llorando <eos> Y no es que te extrañe el corazon <eos> Es que a tu lado aprendi el dolor <eos> CORO <eos> No podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> Estare en tu piel <eos> Cada momento en donde estes <eos> Siempre habra un lugar <eos> Cada recuerdo que sera <eos> Un eterno suspirar <eos> Si estoy llorando <eos> No es que te extrañe el corazon <eos> Es que a tu lado aprendi el dolor <eos> No podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> Estare en tu piel <eos> Cada momento en donde estes <eos> Siempre habra un lugar <eos> Cada recuerdo que sera <eos> Un eterno suspirar <eos> No Podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> 
She played tambourine with a silver jingle <eos> And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes <eos> But the one most requested by the man she knew as cowboy <eos> Was the late night benediction at the y'all come back saloon <eos> In a voice soft and trembling <eos> She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled round her raven hair <eos> And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders <eos> Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo <eos> He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love <eos> Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song <eos> He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> 
I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way <eos> Seems like yesterday <eos> I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away <eos> I've never been the same <eos> I felt the strangest feeling <eos> Like a raging fire it burned <eos> She left, I cried for weeks <eos> And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away <eos> Had to earn my pay <eos> Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say <eos> It only ended up the same way <eos> And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone? <eos> Oh, girl, you answered my question <eos> This time it's working, you've given me new hope <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you <eos> It's got a power of its own <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> (Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho <eos> (Love changes) Let's make love <eos> (Love changes everything) Oh <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl (Love changes) <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> 
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through <eos> I just can't say I don't love you <eos> 'Cause I love you, yeah <eos> It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold <eos> But tonight I'm gon' let you know <eos> Let me tell the truth <eos> Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah <eos> You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes <eos> You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry <eos> You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night <eos> I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time <eos> I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love <eos> I try to find a reason to pull us apart <eos> It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect <eos> And I know that you're worth it <eos> I can't walk away, oh! <eos> Even though we're going through it and it makes you feel alone <eos> Just know that I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah <eos> The distance and the time between us <eos> It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby <eos> I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah <eos> I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through <eos> But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you <eos> Just don't blame me, too, yeah <eos> 'Cause I can't take this pain forever <eos> And you won't find no one that's better <eos> 'Cause I'm right for you, babe <eos> I think I'm right for you, babe <eos> You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes <eos> You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry <eos> It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect <eos> And I know that you're worth it <eos> I can't walk away, oh! <eos> Even though we're going through it <eos> And it makes you feel alone <eos> Just know that I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah <eos> The distance and the time between us <eos> It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby <eos> I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah <eos> I would die for you, I would lie for you <eos> Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby <eos> I'm just sayin', yeah <eos> I would die for you, I would lie for you <eos> Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby <eos> Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na <eos> Even though we're going through it <eos> And it makes you feel alone <eos> Just know that I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah <eos> The distance and the time between us <eos> It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby <eos> I would die for you <eos> Baby, I would die for you, yeah babe <eos> (Die for you) <eos>

Are you leaving? <eos> It's kinda shifted, I feel the difference <eos> Don't want attachment to you, no <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> Just yet, mm <eos>

Loro non sanno di che parlo <eos> Vestiti sporchi, fra', di fango <eos> Giallo di siga' fra le dita <eos> Io con la siga' camminando <eos> Scusami, ma ci credo tanto <eos> Che posso fare questo salto <eos> E anche se la strada è in salita <eos> Per questo ora mi sto allenando <eos> E buonasera, signore e signori <eos> Fuori gli attori <eos> Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni <eos> Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni <eos> Qui la gente è strana tipo spacciatori <eos> Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori <eos> Mo li prendo a calci 'sti portoni <eos> Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori <eos> Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Io ho scritto pagine e pagine <eos> Ho visto sale, poi lacrime <eos> Questi uomini in macchina <eos> Non scalare le rapide <eos> Scritto sopra una lapide <eos> In casa mia non c'è Dio <eos> Ma se trovi il senso del tempo <eos> Risalirai dal tuo oblio <eos> E non c'è vento che fermi <eos> La naturale potenza <eos> Dal punto giusto di vista <eos> Del vento senti l'ebrezza <eos> Con ali in cera alla schiena <eos> Ricercherò quell'altezza <eos> Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta <eos> Prova a tagliarmi la testa <eos> Perché <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cazzo parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Noi siamo diversi da loro <eos>

Do you hear what I hear <eos> Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy <eos> "Do you hear what I hear?" <eos> Ringing through the night, shepherd boy <eos> "Do you hear what I hear?" <eos> A song, a song, high above the tree <eos> With a voice as a big as the sea <eos> With a voice as big as the sea <eos> Now said the shepherd boy to the mighty king <eos> "Do you know what I know?" <eos> "Do you know what I know?" <eos> In your palace, warm, mighty king (mighty king, do you know) <eos> "Do you know what I know?" <eos> A child, a child, shivers in the cold <eos> Let us bring him silver and gold <eos> Let us bring him silver and gold (silver and gold) <eos> Said the king (said the king), to the people everywhere (everywhere) <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Listen to what I say (listen to what I say) <eos> Pray for peace, people everywhere <eos> Listen to what I say (listen to what I say) <eos> A child, a child, sleeping in the night <eos> He will bring us goodness and light <eos> He will bring us goodness and light <eos>

Someday at Christmas <eos> Men won't be boys <eos> Playing with balms like kids play with toys <eos> One warm December <eos> Our hearts will see <eos> A world where men are free <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no wars <eos> When we have learned <eos> What Christmas is for <eos> When we have found <eos> What life's really worth <eos> They'll be peace on Earth <eos> Someday all are dreams will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> We'll see a land <eos> With no hungry children <eos> And no empty hands <eos> One happy morning <eos> Where people will share <eos> A world where people care <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no tears <eos> All men are equal <eos> And no men have no fears <eos> One shinning moment <eos> One prayer away from our world today <eos> Well someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Oh someday at Christmas <eos> Men will not fail <eos> Hate will be gone and love will prevail <eos> Someday a new world we can start <eos> With hope in every heart <eos> Someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where all men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time oh <eos> But someday oh at Christmas time woo <eos> 
Oh little town of Bethlehem <eos> How still we see thee lie <eos> Above thy deep and dreamless sleep <eos> The silent stars go by <eos> Yet in they dark streets shineth <eos> The everlasting light <eos> The hopes and fears of all the years <eos> Are met in thee tonight <eos> For Christ is born of Mary <eos> And gathered all above <eos> While mortals sleep, the angels keep <eos> Their watch of wondering love <eos> Oh morning stars together <eos> Proclaim the holy birth <eos> And praises sing to God the King <eos> And peace to men on Earth <eos> How silently, how silently <eos> The wondrous gift is given <eos> So God imparts to human hearts <eos> The blessings of His heaven <eos> No ear may hear His coming <eos> But in this world of sin <eos> Where meek souls will receive Him still <eos> The dear Christ enters in <eos> Oh holy child of Bethlehem <eos> Descend to us we pray <eos> Cast out our sin and enter in <eos> Be born in us today <eos> We hear the Christmas angels <eos> The great glad tidings tell <eos> Oh come to us, abide with us <eos> Our Lord Emanuel <eos> 
Lights on the trees under falling snow <eos> You get a bit closer when winter's cold <eos> Now I can't wait till you're by my side <eos> All of the best gifts, you just can't buy <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> I wish we were kissing under mistletoe <eos> The stars on the sky just can't match your glow <eos> Now I can't wait till you're by my side <eos> We'll be warm by the fire all night, oh <eos> I wanna hold you while the bells are all ringing <eos> Want you to be here while the angel's singing <eos> Days are perfect when I got you near <eos> My only wish is you here <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> Wherever you are, you brighten the moon <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you) <eos> We could be outside dancing under moonlight <eos> Watching the sky roll over our heads <eos> We could be inside trying to sing the lines right <eos> Laughing until we fall out of bed <eos> So when I wake up on Christmas Day <eos> I hope the first thing I see is your face <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> Wherever you are, you brighten the moon <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you) <eos> It won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> 
Mr. Big Stuff <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Now because you wear all those fancy clothes (oh yeah) <eos> And have a big fine car, oh yes you do now <eos> Do you think I can afford to give you my love (oh yeah) <eos> You think you're higher than every star above <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Now I know all the girls I've seen you with <eos> I know you broke their hearts one after another now, bit by bit <eos> You made 'em cry, many poor girls cry <eos> When they tried to keep you happy, they just tried to keep you satisfied <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me, tell me <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true (oh yeah) <eos> Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you <eos> 'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return (oh yeah) <eos> Now I know this is a lesson Mr. Big Stuff you haven't learned <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna break my heart <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna make me cry <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me <eos> Just who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna break my heart <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna make me cry <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me, tell me <eos> Just who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> 
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind <eos> People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time <eos> All day long, I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy <eos> Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify <eos> Can you help me occupy my brain? <eos> Whoa, yeah <eos> I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find <eos> I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind <eos> Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry <eos> Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal <eos> And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state <eos> I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late <eos> 
I saw Mommy kissin' Santa Claus <eos> Underneath the mistletoe last night <eos> She didn't see me creep <eos> Down the stairs to have a peep <eos> She thought that I was tucked up <eos> In my bedroom, fast asleep <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos>

Joy has dawned upon the world <eos> Promised from creation— <eos> God’s salvation now unfurled <eos> Hope for ev’ry nation <eos> Not with fanfares from above <eos> Not with scenes of glory <eos> But a humble gift of love— <eos> Jesus born of Mary <eos> Sounds of wonder fill the sky <eos> With the songs of angels <eos> As the mighty Prince of Life <eos> Shelters in a stable <eos> Hands that set each star in place <eos> Shaped the earth in darkness <eos> Cling now to a mother’s breast <eos> Vuln’rable and helpless <eos> Shepherds bow before the Lamb <eos> Gazing at the glory; <eos> Gifts of men from distant lands <eos> Prophesy the story <eos> Gold—a King is born today <eos> Incense—God is with us <eos> Myrrh—His death will make a way <eos> And by His blood He’ll win us <eos> Son of Adam, Son of heaven <eos> Given as a ransom; <eos> Reconciling God and man <eos> Christ, our mighty champion! <eos> What a Savior! What a Friend! <eos> What a glorious myst’ry! <eos> Once a babe in Bethlehem <eos> Now the Lord of hist’ry <eos> 
I know there’s a lotta <eos> Talk <eos> I know there’s a lot of talk between the three of us <eos> Your colours show, you say hello <eos> And all else fades into the wash of life <eos> You can put a little spell on me for all you like <eos> The truth is shone in better lights <eos> And all else fades into the depth of night <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that same old trick <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that cheap magic <eos> C-H-E-A-P <eos> M-A-G-I-C <eos> I see you <eos> With a little bit of push and shove the three of us <eos> We tell a lie to say goodbye <eos> And all else fades into the black and white <eos> You can put another blindfold on for all you like <eos> The hands they move without a sight <eos> And all else fades into the wrongest right, right <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that same old trick <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that cheap magic <eos> I wanna show you what you doing to us <eos> That same old trick you got that magical touch <eos> I wanna show you what you doing to us <eos> That same old trick you got that magical touch <eos> 
Well, someone told me yesterday <eos> That when you throw your love away <eos> You act as if you just don't care <eos> You look as if you’re going somewhere <eos> But I just can't convince myself <eos> I couldn't live with no one else <eos> And I can only play that part <eos> And sit and nurse my broken heart <eos> So lonely, lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> Now no one’s knocked upon my door <eos> For a thousand years or more <eos> All made up and nowhere to go <eos> Welcome to this one man show <eos> Just take a seat, they're always free <eos> No surprise, no mystery <eos> In this theatre that I call my soul <eos> I always play the starring role <eos> So lonely, lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> Lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lonely <eos> I feel lo-lo-lo– (Lo-lo-lo–) <eos> I feel lo-lo-lonely (I feel lo-lo-lonely) <eos> I feel lo– <eos> I feel lo– <eos> I feel lo– <eos> You know I feel so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> 
Daddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints <eos> What preachers were preaching You could take to the bank <eos> Kids played outside up until it turned dark <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Trucks took a beatin', the working man too <eos> You could turn on the six o' clock and get the whole truth <eos> A seat belt was a backup for Mama's right arm <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when thе world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Neighbors came by and talked on the porch <eos> We all said goodnight and never locked the front door <eos> Even downtown you could still see the stars <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could Smoke in a Bar <eos> A deal was a deal when you shook a man's hand <eos> When we saw the flag flying, We all gave a damn <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> 
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing <eos> The tune about the wild side of life <eos> As I listen to the words you are saying <eos> It brings memories when I was a trusting wife <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> It's a shame that all the blame is on us women <eos> It's not true that only you men feel the same <eos> From the start most every heart that's ever broken <eos> Was because there always was a man to blame <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> 
Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Mi querida <eos> Madre mía, yo recuerdo <eos> Madre mía, tu cabello como cataratas <eos> Madre mía, tus labios colorados de un rojo sangriento <eos> Madre mía, tus tacones se anunciaban <eos> Madre mía, martillazos se escuchaban por los pasillos <eos> Madre mía, enfrentemos a los hechos <eos> Madre mía, el cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Yo recuerdo amenazas a cuchillo, riñas animales <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Yo no supe qué hacer <eos> Ante tus poderes descomunales <eos> Madre mía, yo he heredado tu abismo <eos> Madre mía, te perdono <eos> Fuiste más que suficiente <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, mi querida <eos> Madre mía, no quedan palabras por decir <eos> Yo aprendí tu idioma <eos> Pero aún me rehuso a hablarlo <eos> Me duele en el alma <eos> Me duele todo de mí <eos> La distancia no fue sino mi única opción, mi única opción <eos> Yo me siento convertir en ti <eos> Madre mía, qué ironía <eos> Madre mía, qué alegría <eos> Yo he heredado tus abismos descomunales <eos> El cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Hasta que lo hice yo <eos> Madre mía, celestial <eos> Eres para siempre, para siempre <eos> Madre mía <eos> Mi origen y mi fin <eos>

My friends are so depressed <eos> I feel the question of your loneliness <eos> Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side <eos> You know I will, you know I will <eos> Ex-girlfriend called me up <eos> Alone and desperate on a prison phone <eos> They want to give her seven years <eos> For being sad <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> My friends are so distressed <eos> And standing on the brink of emptiness <eos> No words I know of to express <eos> This emptiness <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> Imagine me <eos> Taught by tragedy <eos> Release is peace <eos> I heard a little girl <eos> And what she said was something beautiful <eos> To give your love no matter what <eos> Was what she said <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> 
Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> It's like no other pain I've ever known <eos> To love someone so much, to have no control <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos> But I think I'm lost without you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> 'Cause I've been strong for so long <eos> I never thought how much I needed you <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> Strangers rushing past, just tryna get home <eos> You were the only safe haven that I've known <eos> Hits me at full speed, feel like I can't breathe <eos> And nobody knows this pain inside me <eos> My world is crumbling, I should never have let you go <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> I think I'm lost, lost, lost <eos> Ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh, ooh <eos> I think I'm lost without you, you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> And I've been strong for so long <eos> But I never thought how much I love you <eos> Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos>

One, two <eos> When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school <eos> His mind would turn unto the waters <eos> Always the focus of adolescent ridicule <eos> He has no time for farmer’s daughters <eos> Alienated from the clique society <eos> A lonely boy finds peace in fishing <eos> His mother says, "John this is not the way life's supposed to be <eos> Don't you see the life that you are missing?" <eos> And he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> Now years gone by, we find a man that rules the sea <eos> He sets out on a dark May morning <eos> To bring his catch back to this small community <eos> He doesn’t see the danger dawning <eos> Four hours up, oh, the ocean swelled and swelled <eos> The fog rolled in, it started raining <eos> The starboard bow, oh my god, we're going down <eos> They do not hear his frantic mayday <eos> As he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> I'll live and die a fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> We call him John the fisherman <eos>

Where has it gone, that fire <eos> That from the darkn ess kept us <eos> Where all the righteous souls <eos> With flames in their eyes <eos> Yet in the end <eos> The gilded tongues <eos> Yes, in the end <eos> They burrowed in spines <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Step forward, lost seeker <eos> Read the signs of silence <eos> Come close, turn the last stone <eos> Truth lies in violence <eos> See the limbs of chilling mist <eos> Creeping these desolate halls <eos> Searching, it seems for solace <eos> For some haven <eos> From this terrible cold <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Yes, in the end, the gilded ones <eos> They were serpentine <eos> 
You said we wouldn't even see the meteor <eos> At that speed just ask the dinosaurs how they liked it <eos> They didn't like it <eos> Or a tidal wave a hundred stories tall <eos> The point I'm trying to make <eos> Is the time that's upon us <eos> Is all that we're promised <eos> So I said, "Babe, if that's the case <eos> We don't have time to waste" <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> I'm tired of counting down streetlights till we kiss goodnight at your door anymore, it's <eos> The only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> I want to see your sleepy morning face <eos> Over coffee cups and scrambled eggs <eos> And I'Ll get the paper if you get the paper <eos> So we can read about the super genius scientists with laser beams <eos> Who totally saved us <eos> And blew that rock into space dust <eos> So I could be yours in the morning <eos> I'm tired of counting down streetlights till we kiss goodnight at your door anymore, it's <eos> The only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> In the afternoon, in the evening too, darling <eos> Could I be yours? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> It's only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Oh, could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Oh, could I be yours, darling? <eos> Oh, could I be yours? <eos> The point I'm trying to make <eos> Is the time that's upon us <eos> Is all that we're promised <eos> 
When I was your man and you were my girl <eos> We were technicolor in a black and white world <eos> Yeah, they say young love just don't last <eos> Well, it looks like they were right about that <eos> And oh, I hope one day you'll find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I'll put this heart of mine <eos> Somewhere good and safe <eos> In case you want it again someday <eos> Well, you moved on, and so did I <eos> But you danced around in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) <eos> Yeah, good for you, he seems like a good guy <eos> Well, you know me enough to know that's a lie <eos> And oh, I hope one day you'll find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I'll put this heart of mine <eos> Somewhеre good and safe <eos> In case you want it again somеday <eos> Oh, ah <eos> Oh, ooh <eos> You called me up, said you had a big fight <eos> I said don't cry, it's gonna be alright <eos> You say, come over, you just need a friend <eos> Well, I'm on my way, I'll be there in ten <eos> And oh, I knew someday you'd find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I kept this heart of mine <eos> Somewhere good and safe <eos> I knew you'd want it again someday <eos> I always hoped and prayed <eos> That you'd want it again someday <eos> 
Down around the corner <eos> Half a mile from here <eos> You see them long trains runnin' <eos> And you watch 'em disappear <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> You know I saw Miss Lucy <eos> Down along the tracks <eos> She lost her home and her family <eos> And she won't be coming back <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now-na-na-now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, pistons keep on churnin' <eos> And the wheels go 'round and 'round <eos> And the steel rails lie cold and hard <eos> On the mountains they go down <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Ooh, where would you be now? <eos> Mmm, got to get you, baby baby, won't you move it down? <eos> Won't you move it down? <eos> Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down? <eos> When the big train run <eos> When the train is movin' on <eos> I got to keep on movin' <eos> Keep on movin' <eos> Won't you keep on movin'? <eos> Gonna keep on movin' <eos> 
I don't need you to love me, I can't be broken twice <eos> Just tell me I'm beautiful as we lie down, that will suffice <eos> Don't look so guilty as though you've done me wrong <eos> I'm not your victim to be pitied <eos> I'm not yours at all for long <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Ahh Ahhh <eos> But you kissed me too softly and then I felt used <eos> You told me I was there, your call to arms your muse <eos> Don't act so bewitched as though you tried to stay true <eos> Did I enchant you with my voice, was it my hair that maddened you? <eos> Such excuses are heard only in songs <eos> From a time before you and I <eos> There is no great romance here, no <eos> Just a lust you tried to glorify <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> Oooh ooh ooh <eos> I'll never let you hurt me, I'll never let you in <eos> A fool was I to indulge in such sordid dealings <eos> I won't let this bruise me, the choice is my own <eos> Not to let another use me and learn to be alone <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> 
I heard the bells on Christmas day <eos> Their old familiar carols play <eos> And wild and sweet the words repeat <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> I thought how, as the day had come <eos> The belfries of all Christendom <eos> Had rolled along the unbroken song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> And in despair I bowed my head: <eos> “There is no peace on earth, ” I said <eos> “For hate is strong and mocks the song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos> Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: <eos> “God is not dead, nor does he sleep; <eos> The wrong shall fail, the right prevail <eos> With peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos>

Don't you know I'm no good for you? <eos> I've learned to lose you, can't afford to <eos> Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin' <eos> But nothin' ever stops you leavin' <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> Don't you know too much already? <eos> I'll only hurt you if you let me <eos> Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back) <eos> And I'll call you when the party's over <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> But nothin' is better sometimes <eos> Once we've both said our goodbyes <eos> Let's just let it go <eos> Let me let you go <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos>

Peace is not a silent state <eos> That comes upon us from within— <eos> Serene, detached, oblivious <eos> Peace is not a force like rain <eos> That comes, unbidden, from above— <eos> Gentle, enfolding, natural <eos> Peace is fire! Yes, peace is fire! <eos> And peace is passion! <eos> Peace requires a strength of will <eos> A certain courage, a heart of iron <eos> A force abiding to fulfill <eos> Peace is not a foregone fate; <eos> For peace, like war, must be waged— <eos> Mindfully, deliberately <eos> With arms ever ready <eos> And eyes wide open <eos>

See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own <eos> Business as I kick up the treble tone <eos> On my radio tape player box, right <eos> Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? <eos> Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin' <eos> Investigation maybe she was demonstratin' <eos> But nevertheless I was pleased <eos> My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease <eos> Until a group of brothers started buggin' out <eos> Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route <eos> Disrespectin' my black queen <eos> Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene <eos> At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type <eos> They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight <eos> And they see a young couple having a time that's good <eos> And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood <eos> So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do <eos> And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!) <eos> I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit <eos> And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it <eos> Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be <eos> But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy <eos> Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me? <eos> 'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> I told the niggas please let us pass, friend <eos> I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans <eos> But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube <eos> But I had to take the brother out for being rude <eos> And like I said before I was mad by then <eos> It took three or four cops to pull me off of him <eos> But that's the story y'all of a black man <eos> Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African <eos> You see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> The moral of the story is <eos> You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to <eos> 'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it <eos> Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite <eos> 
Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair <eos> First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair <eos> Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks <eos> Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats <eos> Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed <eos> I know every curve like the back of my hand <eos> Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry <eos> I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can <eos> The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt <eos> But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help <eos> Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man <eos> And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets <eos> Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed <eos> I know every curve like the back of my hand <eos> Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry <eos> I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can <eos> We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds <eos> Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers <eos> On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm <eos> Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile <eos> Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed <eos> I know every curve like the back of my hand <eos> Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry <eos> I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can <eos> I'ma take it slow <eos> Just as fast as I can (Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed) <eos> Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand) <eos> 
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do <eos> Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed <eos> Watching you spin in that dress <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> I keep checking you for halos <eos> Swear you're an angel in disguise <eos> You poke my mind from every angle, and I <eos> I can see Heaven in your eyes <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for <eos> And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful <eos> Oh, baby <eos> 'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees) <eos> Whoa, you make me believe <eos> Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> 
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style <eos> In the air there's a feeling of Christmas <eos> Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile <eos> And on every street corner you hear <eos> Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells) <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> (Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green) <eos> As the shoppers rush home with their treasures <eos> (Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene) <eos> And above all this bustle you hear <eos> (Silver bells) Silver bells, (Silver bells) silver bells <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> Silver bells, silver bells, silver, silver bells <eos> 
Pasa y siéntate, tranquilízate <eos> Al fin ya estás aquí, ¿qué más te da? <eos> Imagínate que yo no soy yo <eos> Que soy el otro hombre que esperabas ver <eos> Un desconocido que te ha escrito un verso <eos> Y te dibujó la Luna en un trozo de papel <eos> Un amante improvisado, misterioso, apasionado <eos> Que te dio una cita en este hotel <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Y es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero te dejo y me marcho, para siempre <eos> Imagínate, que yo no soy yo <eos> Que soy el otro hombre que esperabas ver <eos> Un desconocido que te ha escrito un verso <eos> Y te dibujó la Luna en un trozo de papel <eos> Un amante improvisado, misterioso, apasionado <eos> Que te dio una cita en este hotel <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Y es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero te dejo y me marcho, para siempre <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas y me hieres <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Fue sorpresa para ti hallarme en el cuarto en lugar de tu amante <eos> Palideciste y te pusiste muy nerviosa <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero me marcho para siempre (Para siempre) <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Imagina que soy tu mejor amante <eos> Hazme el amor y luego adiós <eos> 
I know the pieces fit <eos> 'Cause I watched them fall away <eos> Mildewed and smoldering <eos> Fundamental differing <eos> Pure intention juxtaposed <eos> Will set two lovers' souls in motion <eos> Disintegrating as it goes <eos> Testing our communication <eos> The light that fueled our fire then <eos> Has burned a hole between us so <eos> We cannot seem to reach an end <eos> Crippling our communication <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> 'Cause I watched them tumble down <eos> No fault, none to blame <eos> It doesn't mean I don't desire <eos> To point the finger, blame the other <eos> Watch the temple topple over <eos> To bring the pieces back together <eos> Rediscover communication <eos> The poetry that comes from the squaring off between <eos> And the circling is worth it <eos> Finding beauty in the dissonance <eos> There was a time that the pieces fit <eos> But I watched them fall away <eos> Mildewed and smoldering <eos> Strangled by our coveting <eos> I've done the math enough to know <eos> The dangers of our second guessing <eos> Doomed to crumble unless we grow <eos> And strengthen our communication <eos> Cold silence has a tendency to <eos> Atrophy any sense of compassion <eos> Between supposed lovers <eos> Between supposed lovers <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> 
La escuela nunca me gustó <eos> Aún recuerdo aquellos tiempos de la prepa <eos> Ya traía un billetón <eos> Desmadroso desde morro <eos> Ya ni modo, esta vida me tocó <eos> Y aquí andamos al millón <eos> Bien placoso y malandrón <eos> Tengo rayas en el cuerpo <eos> Que resaltan a dondequiera que voy <eos> El Sur Centro de Los Ángeles es mi casa <eos> Es de donde vengo yo <eos> Un saludo a mis homeboys <eos> Historias tengo de a montón <eos> Para no hacer largo el cuento <eos> Hoy ya no salgo sin la súper y el cuernón <eos> De atentados la he librado, dos tres veces <eos> Pero Dios no me dejó <eos> Y de frente la traición <eos> ¡Ea! <eos> Mi niño es mi bendición <eos> La razón por la cual no tiro la toalla <eos> No importa la situación <eos> Mi amuleto de la suerte es la familia <eos> Siempre han sido mi motor <eos> Los primos brincan en calor <eos> Noches de fiesta en Hollywood <eos> Cuando hay tiempo, nos perdemos con modelos <eos> Por allá en el W <eos> Hay billetes, no escatimo el presupuesto <eos> Puro Benjamín Azul <eos> Bien positivo es la actitud <eos> Para la chamba soy de acción <eos> Bien pendiente de todas las oficinas <eos> Todo está bajo control <eos> Quién diría que algún día <eos> El compa Jessie les iba a salir cabrón <eos> Aquí seguimos, no me voy <eos> 
The town lights beneath the mountain side seem so dim <eos> As you lay there with your pensive mind in search for a hymn <eos> Then you realize that all thats left is your sad song <eos> That you sing to yourself, cuz no ones gonna come along <eos> You’ve lost your head you have lost your mind <eos> You really lost everything for me this time <eos> You’re broken now, you were broken then <eos> You’ve broken everything you meant to mend <eos> And now you’re spent <eos> But I know what you meant <eos> By what you say <eos> As the town lights fade <eos> From the mountaintop you can see the world through my eyes <eos> I begin to find that you're fed up with all the villagers’ lies <eos> The inspiration you had had  made the journey long <eos> So you sang a song, so you sang a song <eos> 
Suban el telón, abran las cortinas <eos> Enciendan las turbinas con nitroglicerina <eos> El desorden es tu penicilina <eos> Brincando curas los dolores sin aspirina <eos> Vamos a provocar un cortocircuito <eos> Antes de que en el 2012 caiga un meteorito <eos> A portarnos mal, a cometer delitos <eos> A comernos a Caperucita con los tres cerditos <eos> Esto no se trata de rebeldía <eos> Esto se trata de ser indisciplinado por un día <eos> Los incomprendidos del nuevo testamento <eos> Tenemos nuestras reglas, nuestro propio mandamientos <eos> Como no comprenden nuestro comportamiento <eos> A todos los psicólogos les damos tratamiento <eos> Pa' romper con la rutina repetitiva <eos> Que el sol salga de noche y que llueva para arriba <eos> Nos quieren controlar, como a control remoto <eos> Pero la autoridad, no puede con nosotros <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Oye, hoy vinimos a portarnos mal (mal) <eos> Como un niño con su resortera (mal) <eos> Como novia en despedida de soltera <eos> Vamo' a portarnos (mal), pero con dignidad <eos> Vamo' a hacer que Susan Boyle pierda su virginidad <eos> Somos diferentes, nada de lo que se espera <eos> Como una naranja con sabor a pera <eos> No somos clones, no somos imitaciones <eos> Hoy vinimos a hacer lo que no se supone <eos> Contar un cuento sin narrativa <eos> Tirar el cielo patas pa' arriba <eos> Como los árabes que escriben al revés <eos> (caminan con las manos, saludan con los pies) <eos> Con el pie izquierdo empieza el día <eos> Levanta tu cerveza, a brindar por la anarquía <eos> Mama huevaso, vuela sin techo <eos> Defiende tu derecho de hacer lo que no haz hecho <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Como cuando te apuntan con una pistola <eos> La gente con las manos arriba que suban solas <eos> (Como si te apuntaran con una pistola) <eos> (¡Sube la mano!) <eos> (Como si te apuntaran con una pistola) <eos> (¡Sube la mano!) <eos> 
If you told me all about your sorrows <eos> I'd tell you about a cure <eos> If you told me you can't fight the battle <eos> There's a Baby Boy who won the war <eos> The war was won by a Baby Boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> Oh, before that silent night <eos> No Savior and no Jesus Christ <eos> The world cried out so desperately <eos> And the Baby Boy was the reply <eos> Yes, Heaven's reply was a baby boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> See, the King is coming down <eos> And He's here without a crown <eos> The Baby Boy without a bed <eos> Giving life back to the dead <eos> And hear the angels shout it out <eos> As the people come and bow <eos> Unexpected majesty <eos> Alleluia, what a King <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it! <eos> Alleluia, yeah, Heaven's ringing! <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos>

Brother I am air.space <eos> I use the internet every night to escape <eos> Escapades <eos> Oh my days those essays <eos> Chop up the venison steaks <eos> Get laced with these lewd tunes <eos> Introduce you to the most scrutinized Genre of Music <eos> Most of you just abuse it <eos> I tell the truth and pursue it <eos> Others refuting the movement <eos> I’m used to it now, I’m winning every time that I lose it <eos> So I give a fuck what you do <eos> Cause ain’t nothing new <eos> Shit imma do what I want to <eos> Hit em w. a 21|12 <eos> With enough insight to ignite this hellhole <eos> So it’s time to let the whole fuckin world know <eos> My new state of mind bro <eos> Might go, J. Cole <eos> That means kill the game and invite witnesses <eos> Society the drivers seat the first one to get killed? <eos> Well they better pull us over for driving under the influence <eos> Says the joker to the thief <eos> I’m poking holes in your hoody <eos> This emptiness that you seek <eos> Fake rapper tweets <eos> I’m meddling with their stories <eos> And you would have got away with it too if it wasn’t for me <eos> Balling on thin ice skating on my blades of glory <eos> You fuckers have the gall to say “have you got something for me” <eos> Ignoring all the hating, debating, anticipating <eos> You brothers should look me up like celestial navigation <eos> Why the fuck you think I spent months cultivating? <eos> Tryna shift the culture? <eos> Need to motivate a cruel summer <eos> Followed by a late registration <eos> Post graduation, mine for the taking <eos> AK-47’s at the gates of heaven <eos> Shooting down any demons even stepping to this reverence <eos> This testament, my evidence <eos> What it takes to stay true and stay relevant <eos> 
(Tenement slum <eos> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah) <eos> You think that I don't feel love <eos> But what I feel for you is real love <eos> In those eyes, I see reflected <eos> A hurt, scorned, rejected <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, born in poverty <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, take a look at me <eos> Started my life in an old, cold, rundown <eos> Tenement slum (Tenement slum) <eos> My father left, he never even married Mom <eos> I shared the guilt my mama knew <eos> So afraid that others knew I had no name <eos> Ah, this love we're contemplating <eos> Is worth the pain of waiting <eos> We'll only end up hating <eos> The child we may be creating <eos> Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child (Scorned by) society <eos> Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, different from the rest <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out) <eos> I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt <eos> To be without the simple things <eos> So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me <eos> Ah, don't think that I don't need you <eos> Don't think I don't wanna please you <eos> But no child of mine will be bearing <eos> The name of shame I've been wearing <eos> Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> You (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos>

I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on <eos> I have screamed until my veins collapsed <eos> I've waited as my time's elapsed <eos> Now all I do is live with so much fate <eos> I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <eos> I've left behind this little fact <eos> You cannot kill what you did not create <eos> I've gotta say what I've gotta say <eos> And then I swear I'll go away <eos> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <eos> I guess I'll save the best for last <eos> My future seems like one big past <eos> You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <eos> Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone <eos> Tell me the reality is better than the dream <eos> But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos>

No existe amor perfecto <eos> Y empiezo a pensar que esto del amor es una fantasía <eos> Y no me la creo, que tú ya no te acuerdes <eos> De todas las veces que te hice mía <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Tе hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchastе cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de rogarte <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchaste cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de <eos> De rogarte <eos> 
Drink up, baby, stay up all night <eos> With the things you could do, you won't but you might <eos> The potential you'll be, that you'll never see <eos> The promises you'll only make <eos> Drink up with me now and forget all about <eos> The pressure of days, do what I say <eos> And I'll make you okay and drive them away <eos> The images stuck in your head <eos> People you've been before that you <eos> Don't want around anymore <eos> That push and shove and won't bend to your will <eos> I'll keep them still <eos> Drink up, baby, look at the stars <eos> I'll kiss you again, between the bars <eos> Where I'm seeing you there, with your hands in the air <eos> Waiting to finally be caught <eos> Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine <eos> Keep you apart, deep in my heart <eos> Separate from the rest, where I like you the best <eos> And keep the things you forgot <eos> People you've been before that you <eos> Don't want around anymore <eos> That push and shove and won't bend to your will <eos> I'll keep them still <eos>

Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Viendo el Guadalquivir <eos> Las gitanas lavan, los ninõs en la orilla <eos> Veindo los barcos pasar <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> En el Guadalquivir, mi gitana lavaba <eos> Pañuelo de blanco y oro <eos> Que yo te daba, que yo te daba <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> Tú me quieres dejar <eos> Yo no quiero sufrir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos> 
Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cruzaste la frontera de otro cuerpo <eos> Por qué saltaste hacia el abismo de otros besos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Cada mañana en el reflejo de mis sueños <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cambiaste nuestro amor por un antojo <eos> Y desnudaste tu pudor ante otros ojos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué perdiste el equilibrio y te alejaste de mi vida... <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo en aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Muy buena suerte <eos> Yo te deseo un paraíso de mentiras <eos> Un universo con estrellas que no brillan <eos> Yo te quería <eos> Y me obligaste renunciar a la mitad de mi alegría <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías... <eos> Un día entenderás que fue un error <eos> Cambiar la realidad por fantasía <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos>

Better get busy. Better get busy <eos> Days get shorter, air gets colder <eos> Tune on in to the N.O.A.A. radio <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake <eos> They shook you on down <eos> When the rain start falling, boatman calling <eos> Shake ‘em on down <eos> While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake <eos> They shook you on down <eos> When the rain start falling, boatman calling <eos> Shake ‘em on down <eos> The flood receding, the mountain appears <eos> Send out the black bird, send out the dove <eos> 
Contemplating what's gonna be <eos> Wondering which way to turn <eos> Lotta things left to be learned <eos> Complicating silly old me <eos> The things I hold on to <eos> Just let it go & see what it do <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we want to see <eos> Just what we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> Fantasizing having myself a ball <eos> Staring up at the big screen <eos> Problem is I'm the only one <eos> Who's seen it <eos> Realizing it's not like that at all <eos> Time to come down to Earth <eos> & feel what it's really worth <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we wanna see <eos> Just want we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> 
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
We might kiss when we are alone <eos> When nobody's watching <eos> We might take it home <eos> We might make out when nobody's there <eos> It's not that we're scared <eos> It's just that it's delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> We might live like never before <eos> There's nothing to give <eos> Well, how can we ask for more? <eos> We might make love in some sacred place <eos> The look on your face is delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> Why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place that you've known? <eos> Why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos>

Eyes, look beyond the beauty <eos> That lies before you <eos> And lips, say goodbye to her <eos> Though she adores you <eos> And legs, if you know what's good for you <eos> You'll stand up and walk away <eos> And heart, you'll stop loving her today <eos> If you stop loving her today <eos> You'll save yourself a lot of pain <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> You know the only way <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Today <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> You know the only way <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Today <eos> Ears, don't even listen <eos> To her tears as they fall <eos> Even though they make the loudest <eos> Saddest sound of all <eos> And arms, if you know what's best for you <eos> You'll let go right away <eos> And heart, you'll stop loving her today <eos> Today, yeah <eos> If you stop loving her today <eos> You'll save yourself a lot of pain <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> If you don't wanna break <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Just walk away, away <eos> Walk away <eos>

All aboard! Hahahahahahaaaa! <eos> Ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) <eos> Crazy, but that's how it goes <eos> Millions of people living as foes <eos> Maybe it's not too late <eos> To learn how to love and forget how to hate <eos> Mental wounds not healing <eos> Life's a bitter shame <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> (Let's go!) <eos> I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools <eos> I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules <eos> One person conditioned to rule and control <eos> The media sells it and you live the role <eos> Mental wounds still screaming <eos> Driving me insane <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I know that things are going wrong for me <eos> You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah! <eos> Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become <eos> Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb <eos> Crazy, I just cannot bear <eos> I'm living with something that just isn't fair <eos> Mental wounds not healing <eos> Who and what's to blame? <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> (Hahahahahahahaha!) <eos> (Crazy!) <eos> (Gibberish) <eos>

I mouth your name a thousand times <eos> But never could prepare <eos> To know exactly what you are <eos> The blissful unaware <eos> And every chosen memory <eos> Carves into my skin <eos> It slips with every fading smile <eos> Sinking further in <eos> And as I reach into the night <eos> Grasping for your connection in some way <eos> To find myself again <eos> There is more of this to come <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos> And as the red punches through the night <eos> Feasting on ambition <eos> Open to a multitude of light <eos> Pulling me down to the deepest core <eos> And as I reach into the night <eos> I'm grasping for you <eos> Aching for that imagined perpetuity <eos> Feeding me <eos> Feeding love, feeding rage <eos> I'm beginning to see me through <eos> My conscience, my existance, my all <eos> Flickers of feathers and swords in the new thrive <eos> I've been waiting for signals from you all along to dive <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos>

So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> 
You and me, we used to be together <eos> Every day together, always <eos> I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend <eos> I can't believe this could be the end <eos> It looks as though you're lettin' go <eos> And if it's real, well, I don't want to know <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Our memories, well, they can be inviting <eos> But some are altogether mighty frightening <eos> As we die, both you and I <eos> With my head in my hands, I sit and cry <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (No, no, no) <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> It's all ending <eos> We gotta stop pretending who we are <eos> You and me <eos> I can see us dyin', aren't we? <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> I know what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak, no <eos> I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> I know you're good, I know you're good <eos> I know you're real good, oh <eos> La, la, la, la, la, la <eos> Don't, don't, ooh, ooh <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Oh, hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos>

Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, I feel so down <eos> Oh, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, baby, don't care no more <eos> I know this for sure <eos> I'm walking out that door <eos> Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now <eos> And baby, I feel so down <eos> And I don't know why <eos> I keep walking for miles <eos> And say, people, they don't understand <eos> No, girlfriends, they can't understand <eos> Your grandsons, they won't understand <eos> On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand <eos> Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, don't feel so down <eos> Oh, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, baby, gonna be alright <eos> It was a great big lie <eos> 'Cause I left that night, yeah <eos> Oh, people, they don't understand <eos> No, girlfriends, they don't understand <eos> In spaceships, they won't understand <eos> And me, I ain't ever gonna understand <eos> Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, I feel so down <eos> See, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, little girl, I don't care no more <eos> I know this for sure <eos> I'm walking out that door, yeah <eos> 
You don't need to pretend, know you don't want to be friends with me <eos> Don't get defensive, I don't mean to offend, baby <eos> I'm all you want, all you need, so I guess it depends <eos> Don't make me ask you again, again <eos> Plant rosebuds on my cheek, I'll blush like rosé wine <eos> And if you water them enough, I promise we'll be fine <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yеah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> Straight out of the '90s, definition of brown sugar <eos> Hand on your thigh whеn I am driving downtown with you <eos> Everything's right, soon as those bedroom lights get dimmer, dimmer, oh <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yeah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> You can have anything you want (Anything you want) <eos> Anything from you want from me is yours <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy (Crazy), yeah, I'm crazy for you (Crazy) <eos> Approach me, baby (Ah), I'm crazy for you, crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy (Crazy, crazy) <eos> You can go, go (Crazy, crazy, crazy) crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da <eos> 
Down here the river, meets the sea <eos> And in the sticky heat, I feel ya' open up to me <eos> Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> Lying here, underneath the stars, right next to you <eos> And I'm wondering who you are and, how do you do? <eos> How do you do, baby? <eos> Clouds roll in across the moon and the wind hollers out your name <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> {Guitar Solo: Buddy Guy} <eos> We never going to make that bridge tonight, baby <eos> Across lake Ponchartrain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> So batten down the hatch baby and leave your heart up your sleeve <eos> It looks like we're in for stormy weather, that ain't no cause for us to leave <eos> Just lay here, in my arms, let it wash away the pain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> 
You're taking what you want right from me <eos> Wrapped up in so much <eos> Life is just the way you hold me <eos> You pick your miscellaneously <eos> Wrapped up in all the choices you're not giving to me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to  fill the empty spaces <eos> You're saying what you want right to me <eos> No filter on your mouth, we know you talk in your sleep <eos> Remembering the times they won't remember me <eos> Our nights melt into sequels, you sink into me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit, just a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of, oh <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos>

I don't love her <eos> I tried to tell myself <eos> But you can see it in my eyes <eos> So don't deny <eos> I can't fool no one else <eos> The truth is in the tears I cry <eos> 'Cause... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> I told her I'd never fall in love <eos> But now I know better <eos> How does it feel <eos> I can't describe this feeling <eos> That came when I saw her last night <eos> She got to me <eos> I'll let you know the reason <eos> I saw her with another guy <eos> So... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> And if it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Maybe she'll take me back <eos> (Hey, girl, he's begging) <eos> I made a big mistake <eos> (Won't you forgive him, girl) <eos> Now I can feel it <eos> (He's never felt before) <eos> I really love her <eos> (You love her?!?! What?!?!) <eos> It took my heart <eos> To shatter in a thousand pieces <eos> Before I'd ever drop my pride <eos> (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <eos> Losing love worrying about my image <eos> Really helped me realize <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (On my mind all the time) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (She stays on my mind, mind, mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't, I can't describe this feeling that I feel for her) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (Stay on my mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos>

Well, you read to me from the riot act <eos> Way on high, high <eos> Clutching a crisp new testament <eos> Breathing fire, fire <eos> Will you save me the fake benevolence <eos> I don't have time, I <eos> I'm just too far gone for a telling <eos> I've lost my pride <eos> I don’t mind being lonely <eos> So leave me alone <eos> Oh, you're acting all holy <eos> Me, I’m just full of holes <eos> Well, I could dip my head in the river <eos> Cleanse my soul, oh <eos> I'll still have the stomach of a sinner <eos> Face like an unholy ghost <eos> Will you save me all the soliloquies <eos> Paid my fines <eos> I'll be gone before my deliverance <eos> Preach what you like <eos> 'Cause I don't mind being lonely <eos> So leave me alone <eos> You're acting all holy <eos> Me, I'm just full of holes, full of holes <eos> Don't mind being lonely <eos> Spare me the brimstone <eos> Acting all holy <eos> When you know I'm full of holes <eos> Don't mind being lonely <eos> Don't need to be told <eos> Stop acting so holy <eos> I know I'm full of holes, full of holes <eos> Ah, ah-ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah-ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah-ah, ah <eos> I don't mind being lonely <eos> Won't you leave me alone <eos> Oh, you're oh so holy <eos> And I'll never be good enough <eos> Don’t care if I'm lonely <eos> Cause it feels like home <eos> I'll never be holy <eos> Thank God I'm full of holes, full of holes <eos> 
Que me despierten si es que estoy soñando <eos> Y es que contigo estoy alucinando <eos> Porque ha llegado el día que tanto he esperado y me tiene contento <eos> Me miro en el espejo y te veo conmigo porque <eos> Aunque siendo novios también somos amigos <eos> Conozco tus defectos y conoces bien los míos y eso es lo bonito <eos> Y con los pajaritos te llevo serenata <eos> Carlos Vives, la provincia y su parranda vallenata <eos> Bailando esta canción que hoy te dedico <eos> Te espero en el altar y te prometo estar contigo <eos> Hasta que seamos viejitos <eos> Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos <eos> De tanto reír y de tantos besitos <eos> Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2) <eos> Ella sabe que su mirada es el mejor vestido <eos> Me da un besito cada vez que se lo pido <eos> A ella le gusta que bailemos Tropipop <eos> Y cuando nos vamos de fiesta, le canto al oído y le digo <eos> (Te amo) Es que me tienes loco loquito <eos> (Tanto) Y si quieres yo te lo repito <eos> Te quiero, te quiero, te quiero tanto ay te quiero tanto (2) <eos> Hasta que seamos viejitos <eos> Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos <eos> De tanto reír y de tantos besitos <eos> Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2) <eos> Tengo que confesar que eres lo que soñé <eos> Y de esos ojos tan bonitos yo me enamoré <eos> Por ti yo me derrito y tú lo sabes <eos> Te ves más linda cuando no usas maquillaje <eos> Y con los pajaritos te llevo serenata <eos> Alejandro y la provincia y su parranda vallenata <eos> Bailando esta canción que hoy te dedico <eos> Te espero en el altar y te prometo estar contigo <eos> Hasta que seamos viejitos <eos> Y la piel se nos arrugue de a poquitos <eos> De tanto reír y de tantos besitos <eos> Ay que nos dimos, ay que nos dimos (2) <eos>

I can see every time I look into your eyes <eos> You don't care a thing about those other guys <eos> Without words, you made me understand what's on your mind <eos> The rhythm of your body next to mine <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Ooh-ooh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Oh-oh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> 
I'm going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Chilly wind don't blow <eos> I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe <eos> Going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe <eos> Don't care where you go <eos> Some other man, some other man <eos> Some other man, some other man <eos> He's always hanging around <eos> I'd rather be dead, rather be dead <eos> Rather be dead, I'd rather be dead <eos> Six feet in the ground <eos> I'm going down south, going down south <eos> Going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Chilly wind don't blow <eos> 
Fuck... <eos> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road <eos> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go <eos> So make the best of this test, and don't ask why <eos> It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> So take the photographs and still frames in your mind <eos> Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time <eos> Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial <eos> For what it's worth, it was worth all the while <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life... <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
And I feel that time's a wasted go <eos> So where ya goin' 'til tomorrow? <eos> And I see that these are lies to come <eos> So would you even care? <eos> And I feel it <eos> And I feel it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> And I feel, so much depends on the weather <eos> So is it rainin' in your bedroom? <eos> And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray <eos> So would you even care? <eos> And I feel it <eos> And she feels it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> To find it <eos> To find it <eos> To find it <eos> 
I won't tell you I'm lonely <eos> 'Cause it may be selfish <eos> I won't ask you to hold me <eos> 'Cause that won't mend what's helpless <eos> There's not a thing I could say <eos> Not a song I could sing for your mind to change <eos> Nothing can fill up the space <eos> Won't ask you to stay <eos> But let me ask you one thing <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love with me? <eos> I can't float in an ocean <eos> That's already been drained <eos> I won't cry at your feet now <eos> I know my tears will fall in vain <eos> There's not a thing I could say <eos> Not a song I could sing for your mind to change <eos> Nothing can fill up the space <eos> Won't ask you to stay <eos> But let me ask you one thing <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love with me? <eos> No use wondering <eos> Why your change in heart has wandered <eos> So I'll ask you this question <eos> 'Cause it might help me sleep longer <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you run out of love for me? <eos> Out of love (Out of love) <eos> Out of love (Out of love) <eos> Out of love with me <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
Quizás te puedas preguntar <eos> Qué le hace falta a esta noche blanca <eos> A nuestras vidas que ya han vivido tanto <eos> Que han visto mil colores de sábanas de seda <eos> Y cuando llueve te gusta caminar <eos> Vas abrazándome sin prisa aunque te mojes <eos> Amor mío, lo nuestro es como es <eos> Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada <eos> Estoy aquí, tan enamorado de ti <eos> Que la noche dura un poco más <eos> El grito de una ciudad <eos> Que ve nuestras caras la humedad <eos> Y te haré compañía más allá de la vida <eos> Yo te juro que arriba te amaré más <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> La mañana nos traerá un canto nuevo de pájaros alegres <eos> Amor mío, así es la vida juntos <eos> Dos locos de repente <eos> Sonriéndole a la gente que nos ve pasar <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos> Poco a poco el abrazo <eos> Boca a boca, despacio <eos> Aliento y suspiros tibios, anochecer <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos> 
Wise men say only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Oh, shall I stay? Would it be a sin? <eos> Oh, if I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Oh, like a river flows surely to the sea <eos> Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be <eos> Take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> Oh, for I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Woah, like a river flows surely to the sea <eos> Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be <eos> Oh, take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Woah, for I can't help falling in love with you <eos> 
Yeah, yeah <eos> Primero, quiero decirte que te amé cada segundo <eos> Nunca te fallé (Fallé), con decirte esto, mami, ya yo cumplo <eos> Pero terceros que quisieron dañar tu relación conmigo <eos> Y ahora el cuarto se siente frío <eos> Y yo ando viendo el techo, recordándote <eos> Y a Dio' pidiendo que esté cuidándote <eos> No soy bueno fingiendo que ya te olvidé <eos> Bebé, tú me hace' falta, sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> Ando viendo el techo y el cuarto está frío <eos> Te fuiste de mi vida y me siento vacío <eos> La' noche' de perreo nunca la' olvido <eos> Y ahora salgo pa' la calle y casi ni sonrío <eos> Bebé, tú me lastima' <eos> No te lo digo pa' que sienta' lástima <eos> E' que éramo' una combi fantástica <eos> Yo era tú fan y tú era' mi fanática, pero al final <eos> Tú me lastima' <eos> No te lo digo pa' que sienta' lástima <eos> E' que éramo' una combi fantástica <eos> Yo era tú fan y tú era' mi fanática, pero al final (Final) <eos> Ando viendo el techo, recordándote <eos> Y a Dio' pidiendo que esté cuidándote <eos> No soy bueno fingiendo que ya te olvidé <eos> Bebé, tú me hace' falta, sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> ¿Y cómo se supera <eos> Los beso' que nos dábamo' sentao' en la escalera? <eos> Todavía tengo tu foto en mi cartera <eos> Es que pa' mí, tú nunca será' pasajera <eos> Y no te miento <eos> Esta soledad me está matando lento <eos> Sigo esperándote en el mismo asiento <eos> No me preparé para el final del cuento, oh-oh <eos> Bebé, tú me lastima' <eos> No te lo digo pa' que sienta' lástima <eos> E' que éramo' una combi fantástica <eos> Yo era tú fan y tú era' mi fanática, pero al final <eos> Tú me lastima' <eos> No te lo digo pa' que sienta' lástima <eos> E' que éramo' una combi fantástica <eos> Yo era tú fan y tú era' mi fanática, pero al final <eos> Ando viendo el techo, recordándote <eos> Y a Dio' pidiendo que esté cuidándote <eos> No soy bueno fingiendo que ya te olvidé <eos> Bebé, tú me hace' falta, sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> Y sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> Y sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> Y sin ti la' noche' son larga' <eos> 
Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> And since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought me some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss goodnight <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> And the fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> But as long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, and snow <eos> When we finally kiss goodnight <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really grab me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Oh, the fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> But as long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos>

Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos>

Morning scatters in and I am steady like a drug <eos> Feeling out this one <eos> She wakes up smashed as hell and steadies her ass against the rail <eos> And bends before the pounding rain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas all along about my love <eos> And I need this fucking fix and I beg her to pick from <eos> One of a million ways to feel no pain <eos> The morning after bends reflected in and I can hardly stand <eos> The way this whole thing makes me seem <eos> She climbs out from a dream with lungs hardening <eos> She screams a stereo scream <eos> And bends before astounding rain <eos> She's got a system made of metal with magnet bits inside her brain <eos> She opens her box of tricks and begs me to pick from <eos> One of a billion ways to feel no pain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me uptight, let me breathe now <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me upright, let me breathe now <eos>

(Verse 1 : ) <eos> I call you <eos> When I need you <eos> My heart's on fire <eos> You come to me <eos> Come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> Oh, you come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> You bring a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> You speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart baby <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Verse 2 : ) <eos> In your heart I see <eos> The start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Bridge : ) <eos> Each time you leave me <eos> I start losing control <eos> You're walking away <eos> With my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel it even when I'm alone <eos> Oh baby, don't let go <eos> (Chorus :) <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Outro :) <eos> You're the best <eos> 
She's comin for you <eos> Hear the chains rattle <eos> Turn you into a slave <eos> Another piece of chattel <eos> Across the seas <eos> Stormy waters <eos> Showed no mercy <eos> She was satan’s daughter <eos> Born to steal <eos> With bodies to sell <eos> She had her own special <eos> Place in hell <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> She took souls <eos> On a horrible trip <eos> Her morning song <eos> Was the crack of a whip <eos> Ones who survived <eos> Died a long time ago <eos> Most of them buried <eos> Out at old plateau <eos> But the pain and the memory <eos> Will never go away <eos> Her spirits still lives <eos> By the shores of the bay <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' with her ghost <eos> She was a dirty secret <eos> Forgot but not forgiven <eos> But the shame was so great <eos> She could not stay hidden <eos> She's on fire.... <eos> Her flame no longer lights up atnight <eos> Now dreams survive and hope burns bright <eos> People still come from miles around <eos> To praise the folks of africatown <eos> Who rose from the ashes of sad history <eos> To stand unchained proud and free <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' <eos> We’re still livin' <eos> With her ghost <eos>

Me and Magdalena <eos> We're driving south through Monterey <eos> As the sun is slowly sinking <eos> Into a distant ocean wave <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Tell me Magdalena <eos> What do you see in the depths of your night? <eos> Do you see a long lost father? <eos> Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child? <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Me and Magdalena <eos> Always leaving early and sleeping late <eos> Secluded in the canyon <eos> Lost within a turn of fate <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> 
I like the shades you're wearing and I like your new tattoo <eos> I see you went and dyed your hair and got a new perfume <eos> I shouldda known you'd be here dancin' to a fiddle song <eos> Kickin' up dust and stirring up mem'ries, blurring lines between right and wrong <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a lightening strike sheds light on falling rain <eos> Some things never change <eos> I feel there's still a sliver of my old love-lorn soul <eos> Tangled inside your heart that I lost long ago <eos> Cause longin' don't seem to matter how many years go by <eos> You and me we fit together we don't even have to try <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a bonfire fades when it runs out of flame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Will the way you feel remain the same? <eos> They say true love finds a way <eos> No the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> And I'll be by myself as the sun shines on my shame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> 
I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> When the lights go off, I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm <eos> The way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader <eos> 'Cause you know it's what you're good at, the low road for the fast track <eos> Make every second last <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out <eos> 'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd <eos> Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home-team <eos> I'll be the narrator, telling another tale of the American dream <eos> I see your name in lights, we can make you a star <eos> Girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out <eos> 'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd, woah-oh-oh <eos> Ha-ha <eos> Take a breath, don't it sound so easy? Never had a doubt, now I'm going crazy <eos> Watching from the floor <eos> Take a breath, and let the rest come easy, never settle down, 'cause the cash flow leaves me <eos> Always wanting more <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out <eos> 'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle... <eos> 
I am walking <eos> Out in the rain <eos> And I am listening to the low moan <eos> Of the dial tone again <eos> And I am getting <eos> Nowhere with you <eos> And I can't let it go <eos> And I can't get through... <eos> The old woman behind the pink curtains <eos> And the closed door <eos> On the first floor <eos> She's listening through the air shaft <eos> To see how long our swan song can last <eos> And both hands <eos> Now use both hands <eos> Oh, no don't close your eyes <eos> I am writing <eos> Graffiti on your body <eos> I am drawing the story of <eos> How hard we tried <eos> I am watching your chest rise and fall <eos> Like the tides of my life <eos> And the rest of it all <eos> And your bones have been my bedframe <eos> And your flesh has been my pillow <eos> I am waiting for sleep <eos> To offer up the deed <eos> With both hands <eos> In each other's shadows we grew less and less tall <eos> And eventually our theories couldn't explain it all <eos> And i'm recording our history now on the bedroom wall <eos> And when we leave the landlord will come <eos> And paint over it all <eos> And I am walking <eos> Out in the rain <eos> And I am listening to the low moan of the dial tone again <eos> And I am getting nowhere with you <eos> And I can't let it go <eos> And I can't get through <eos> So now use both hands <eos> Please use both hands <eos> Oh, no don't close your eyes <eos> I am writing graffiti on your body <eos> I am drawing the story of how hard we tried <eos> Hard we tried <eos> How hard we tried <eos> 
Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> S'envole une chanson <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Elle est née d'aujourd'hui <eos> Dans le cœur d'un garçon <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Marchent des amoureux <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Leur bonheur se construit <eos> Sur un air fait pour eux <eos> Sous le pont de Bercy <eos> Un philosophe assis <eos> Deux musiciens quelques badauds <eos> Puis les gens par milliers <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Jusqu'au soir vont chanter <eos> Hum Hum <eos> L'hymne d'un peuple épris <eos> De sa vieille cité <eos> Près de Notre Dame <eos> Parfois couve un drame <eos> Oui mais à Paname <eos> Tout peut s'arriver <eos> Quelques rayons <eos> Du ciel d'été <eos> L'accordéon <eos> D'un marinier <eos> L'espoir fleurit <eos> Au ciel de Paris <eos> Et le ciel de Paris <eos> A son secret pour lui <eos> Depuis vingt siècles il est épris <eos> De notre Île Saint Louis <eos> Quand elle lui sourit <eos> Il met son habit bleu <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Quand il pleut sur Paris <eos> C'est qu'il est malheureux <eos> Quand il est trop jaloux <eos> De ses millions d'amants <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Il fait gronder sur nous <eos> Son tonnerr' éclatant <eos> Mais le ciel de Paris <eos> N'est pas longtemps cruel <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Pour se fair' pardonner <eos> Il offre un arc en ciel <eos> 
Oh, pour me another drink <eos> And punch me in the face <eos> You can call me Nancy <eos> Every man wears a symbol <eos> And I know I have mine <eos> I've got my right hand stamped <eos> In the concentration camp <eos> Where my organs scream <eos> "Slow down, man!" <eos> Ooh, how was I to know <eos> Milk and honey flowed <eos> Just a couple states below? <eos> Ooh <eos> Oh, hook me up to the tank <eos> And roll me to the door <eos> I'm going where my body leads me <eos> I can fend for myself <eos> With what looks I have left <eos> I'll put away a few <eos> And pretty soon I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes <eos> Ooh, how was I to know <eos> Milk and honey flowed <eos> Just a couple states below? <eos> Ooh, give me how it was <eos> Our place under the sun <eos> Before the devil made me run <eos> "Run, boy" <eos> "Run, boy" <eos> Ooh <eos> 
Oh <eos> I was just a girl, you were just a boy <eos> Together we were one <eos> Together we were perfect <eos> Talk about in sync <eos> You know what I'm thinking <eos> Before I could even think it, get out my head <eos> I was just a girl, and you were just a boy <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> I was just a girl, you were just a boy <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> I was just a girl, you were just a boy <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> I was just a girl, you were just a boy <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Two ordinary people <eos> Made extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos> Extraordinary love <eos>

I need you, Christmas <eos> Friends by the fire to hold <eos> Times have been lonely <eos> And lately, I just feel alone <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Family with nowhere to go <eos> Angels on treetops and angels in the snow <eos> Oh, the cold <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I know <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> You don't ever change <eos> I miss the feeling <eos> Waiting for Santa to show <eos> Caroling late night <eos> And all the children's eyes aglow <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Oh, how I miss you the most <eos> Greetings from loved ones <eos> And lovers under mistletoe <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> If you're young, if you're old <eos> We all wait to be told <eos> Just a simple phrase <eos> "Have a Merry Christmas" <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Christmas, ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I hope <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> 'Cause I need you, Christmas <eos> 
Mmh-mmh, mmh <eos> No quiero borrar <eos> Todas las veces que me equivoqué <eos> No quiero quitar todas las piedras del camino <eos> Ni coser heridas que quedaron cuando tropecé <eos> No voy a olvidar <eos> Quién estuvo ahí las noches que me derrumbé <eos> Quién me dio la mano cuando me vio caer <eos> Quién prendió una vela cuando no podía ver <eos> No soy un ángel <eos> Nadie me enseñó a volar, no soy perfecta <eos> Sigo aprendiendo a caminar <eos> Imposible <eos> Tocar el cielo sin tocar el fondo <eos> Aprendí que lo bueno no es para siempre <eos> Y lo malo tampoco <eos> Ya lo hice <eos> Desperté y abracé mis demonios <eos> Llegar a aceptarlos fue duro, pero hasta la luna <eos> Tiene su lado oscuro <eos> Hoy puedo saber <eos> Que no hay dolor que no se cure con el tiempo <eos> Que no hay palabra que no se lleva el viento <eos> Que lo único que tengo es el momento <eos> No soy un ángel <eos> Nadie me enseñó a volar, no soy perfecta <eos> Sigo aprendiendo a caminar <eos> Imposible <eos> Tocar el cielo sin tocar el fondo <eos> Aprendí que lo bueno no es para siempre <eos> Y lo malo tampoco <eos> Ya lo hice <eos> Desperté y abracé a mis demonios <eos> Llegar a aceptarlos fue duro, pero hasta la luna <eos> Tiene su lado oscuro <eos> Oscuro <eos> 
La mujer piensa, la mujer puede, la mujer es tan capaz como el hombre <eos> Cheeks are rosy like a Boucher cherub <eos> I'm a strawberry soda, raise my lashes to heaven <eos> Stars in my hair running like a waterfall <eos> Clouds in the whites of our eyes, we saw it all <eos> Burnt me at the stake, you thought I was a witch <eos> Centuries ago, now you just call me a bitch <eos> Mother nature's dying <eos> Nobody's keeping score <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> Marilyn's bungalow, it's number seven <eos> In the pink palacе where men madе her legend <eos> Owned by a sheik who killed thousands of gay men <eos> I guess that's why he bought the campest hotel in LA then <eos> Mother nature's dying <eos> Nobody's keeping score <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> If you have a mother, daughter, or a friend <eos> Maybe it is time, time you comprehend <eos> The world that you live in ain't the same one as theirs <eos> So don't punish me for not being a man <eos> Spring appears when the time is right <eos> Women are violets coming to light <eos> Don't underestimate the making of life <eos> The planet has a funny way of stopping a fight <eos> Mother nature's dying <eos> Nobody's keeping score <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> I don't wanna live in a man's world anymore <eos> If you have a mother, daughter, or a friend <eos> Maybe it is time, time you comprehend <eos> The world that you live in ain't the same one as theirs <eos> So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man <eos> So don't punish me 'cause I'm not a man <eos> 'Cause I'm not a man <eos> Que el sexo no sea lo que nos haga débiles, el sexo tiene que ser lo que nos haga fuertes <eos> 
Always when we fight <eos> I try to make you laugh <eos> Til everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> Always when we fight <eos> I kiss you once or twice <eos> And everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> I love you Sunday song <eos> The weeks not yet begun <eos> And everything is quiet <eos> And it's always you and me <eos> Always and forever <eos> You and me always and forever <eos> And it was always <eos> You and me always <eos> You tell me I'm a real man <eos> And try to look impressed <eos> Not very convincing <eos> But you know I love it <eos> Now we watch TV <eos> Til we fall asleep <eos> Not very exciting <eos> But it's you and me <eos> And we'll always be together <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> 
The other night when we kissed <eos> You told me I was yours forever <eos> But when I woke up the next morning, you were gone <eos> Come back baby <eos> Come into my arms <eos> You, you showed me how love could be <eos> Just show me how much you need <eos> You've always been by my side <eos> Oh, baby that's no lie <eos> 'Cause I, I've always been true to you <eos> I've always loved one, that's true <eos> Oh baby, can't you see that it's you <eos> You know that I love you so <eos> Chorus: <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real <eos> I've always been too much for you it burns inside <eos> To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side <eos> Repeat (2x) <eos> You, you shared your thoughts with me <eos> You shared your secrecies <eos> And oh, how that makes me feel <eos> Listen baby, lets be forever <eos> 'Cause I, I know I will always be good <eos> I know in my heart I should <eos> I'll never ever do you wrong <eos> My love for you is strong <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> We, we can't just let this die <eos> You gotta give our love a try <eos> Oh please be by my side <eos> Don't even begin to cry <eos> 'Cause I, I'm waiting to be with you <eos> Just give me the chance to prove <eos> That I'm the only one for you <eos> You know I was the one <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side, your not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> So please be by my side <eos> Please be by my side <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> This love for you is real <eos> It burns inside <eos> I know you're sorry you did me wrong <eos> But until then I'll remember <eos> You'll be back, back into my arms <eos> 
The first time I ever talked to you <eos> My heart told me you were a dream came true <eos> And the first time you put your hand in mine <eos> I was wishing it would last a lifetime <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> And we kept close under the mistletoe <eos> As we watched the moonlit shadow in the snow <eos> And it was then, that I knew for sure <eos> That I got just what I asked for <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> I know I see angels <eos> When I look in your eyes <eos> When I wake Christmas Day <eos> You'll be my big surprise <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>  Well, Ron, you know Christmas is all the same man <eos> Yeah, Mike, and I can't wait to the 25th <eos>  Because I know my mother bought me something very special <eos>  Special? There's nothing more special <eos> Than being under the Christmas tree with your family <eos> Opening gifts, spreading love, that's a serious feeling <eos>  Well fellas, let's remember that the spirit of Christmas is all about giving <eos> What do you think, Ralph? <eos>  What, who me, Rick? Well, the greatest gift I could ever have <eos> Is to spend Christmas with my two favorite girls: <eos> My mother and of course my Candy Girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>

I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> 
(Do you believe?) Walk on water <eos> Can you even see what you're fighting for? <eos> Blood lust and a holy war <eos> Listen up, hear the patriot shout: <eos> "Times are changing" <eos> In the end, the choice was clear <eos> Take a shot in the face of fear <eos> Fist up in the firing line <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> (Do you believe?) <eos> Look at the sky, see a dying star <eos> White lies, it's a man on fire <eos> Making love with the devil hurts <eos> Times are changing <eos> A thin line, the whole truth <eos> The far right, the left view <eos> Breaking all those promises made <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe?

Hey, mom, I know we're gettin' old <eos> And the lines on our hands have changed <eos> But you still look at me the same <eos> Hey, mom, guess what? You're really tough <eos> And I know you did all you could <eos> Just to make sure my life was good <eos> Sorry for the fights and the tone of my voice <eos> Sorry for the nights when I made the wrong choice <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go to the mall and buy some shoes <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey, dad, what's up? Miss you so much <eos> Yeah, the shade of your hair has changed <eos> But I look up to you the same <eos> Taught me how to fish, taught me how to ride a bike <eos> Taught me how to love, how to treat a woman right <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go for a drive or watch the news <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey you, sit back <eos> Don't go so fast <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> So let's do the things we always do <eos> Or maybe we try something brand new <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos> 
Back in black, I hit the sack <eos> I've been too long, I'm glad to be back <eos> Yes, I'm let loose from the noose <eos> That's kept me hanging about <eos> I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high <eos> Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die <eos> I got nine lives, cat's eyes <eos> Abusing every one of them and running wild <eos> 'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> Back in the back of a Cadillac <eos> Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack <eos> Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang <eos> They've got to catch me if they want me to hang <eos> 'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack <eos> Nobody's gonna get me on another rap <eos> So, look at me now, I'm just making my play <eos> Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way <eos> 'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black, yow <eos> Ah, yeah <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Take my love <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah <eos> Ah, hey yeah <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Well, I'm back (I'm back) <eos> Back, well I'm (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back, back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> I've hit the sack <eos> 
Get out tonight <eos> From the deafening sound inside <eos> That I’ll deny <eos> But it feels like I’m right <eos> I’m feeling alright <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> Cut down to size <eos> Paralyzed <eos> Low tide <eos> Wait to rise <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> You lye, you lye, you lye <eos> Until you decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> Until you... <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> 
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me <eos> You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy <eos> There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you <eos> You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you <eos> I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you <eos> How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you <eos> You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in <eos> That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much <eos> Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started <eos> I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted <eos> Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding <eos> Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing <eos> Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar <eos> I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler <eos> Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning <eos> We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> And I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> 
I'm driving home for Christmas <eos> Oh, I can't wait to see those faces <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah <eos> Well, I'm moving down that line <eos> And it's been so long <eos> But I will be there <eos> I sing this song <eos> To pass the time away <eos> Driving in my car <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> It's gonna take some time but I'll get there <eos> Top to toe in tailbacks <eos> Oh, I got red lights all around <eos> But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah <eos> Get my feet on holy ground <eos> So I sing for you <eos> Though you can't hear me <eos> When I get through <eos> And feel you near me <eos> Driving in my car <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> With a thousand memories <eos> I take look at the driver next to me <eos> He's just the same <eos> Just the same <eos> Top to toe in tailbacks <eos> Oh, I got red lights all around <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah <eos> Get my feet on holy ground <eos> So I sing for you <eos> Though you can't hear me <eos> When I get through <eos> Oh and feel you near me <eos> Driving in my car <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> With a thousand memories <eos> I take look at the driver next to me <eos> He's just the same <eos> He's driving home, driving home <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> 
Dennis DJ <eos> MC G15 <eos> Para pra pensar se a gente é acidente <eos> Se foi por acaso que o beijo que rolou <eos> Deve ser coisa de Deus na minha frente <eos> Porque, de tantas bocas, a nossa encaixou <eos> (Ô, Senhor, agora, sim!) <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada (Me dá uma sentada) <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Oi, vem) <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o bumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Bumbumbumbumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o... vai, vai, vai <eos> Dennis DJ, sou teu fã! <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Vai, vai, vai, vai) <eos> 
Life's like a road that you travel on <eos> When there's one day here and the next day gone <eos> Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand <eos> Sometimes you turn your back to the wind <eos> There's a world outside every darkened door <eos> Where blues won't haunt you anymore <eos> Where the brave are free and lovers soar <eos> Come ride with me to the distant shore <eos> We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate <eos> There's not much time left today <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> Through all the cities and all these towns <eos> It's in my blood and it's all around <eos> I love you now like I loved you then <eos> This is the road and these are the hills <eos> From Mozambique to those Memphis nights <eos> The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights <eos> Knock me down, get back up again <eos> You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man <eos> There's no load I can't hold <eos> The roads are rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, hmm <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> There was a distance between you and I <eos> A misunderstanding once <eos> But now we look it in the eye <eos> Oh <eos> There ain't no load that I can't hold <eos> Road so rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, ooh <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> 
At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops <eos> With him on top, lemon yellow sun <eos> Arms raised in a "V" <eos> And the dead lay in pools of maroon below <eos> Daddy didn't give attention <eos> Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Clearly, I remember picking on the boy <eos> Seemed a harmless little fuck <eos> Ooh, but we unleashed a lion <eos> Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast <eos> How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left <eos> My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open <eos> Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard <eos> Daddy didn't give affection, no <eos> And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Try to forget this (Try to forget this) <eos> Try to erase this (Try to erase this) <eos> From the blackboard <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in...) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> Ooh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh <eos> Ooh oh, oh (Spoke in...) <eos> 
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> And I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> 'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> 
He intentado casi todo para convencerte, uh <eos> Mientras el mundo se derrumba todo, aquí a mis pies, yeah <eos> Mientras aprendo de esta soledad que desconozco, woah <eos> Me vuelvo a preguntar quizás si sobreviviré <eos> Porque sin ti me queda la conciencia helada y vacía <eos> Porque sin ti me he dado cuenta amor que no renaceré, yeah <eos> Porque he ido más allá del límite de la desolación <eos> Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Ay, yo te juro que <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida (No) <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Qué no dejaría <eos> Y duelen más la' cosa' buena' cuando estás ausente <eos> Yo sé que e' demasiado tarde para remediar <eos> No me queda bien valerme de diez mil excusas <eos> Cuando definitivamente sé que ahora te vas <eos> Y aunque no lo pueda cambiar, yo seguiré esperándote <eos> Por si algún día tú me quiere' ver bien <eos> Aunque te vuelva a repetir que estoy muriendo día a día <eos> Aunque también estés muriendo, tú no me perdonarás <eos> Aunque sin ti haya llegado al límite de la desolación <eos> Y mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Yo sigo muriéndome <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión (Mi religión) <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos (Yeah) <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe, oh <eos> CNCO <eos> 
Did you miss me? <eos> Did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Take a second <eos> To comprehend this <eos> Air it out like dark matter <eos> Preach about the new meta <eos> All the things that we did, that we said, it was all in my head <eos> Will it ever get better? <eos> So tell me, do you like the taste? <eos> Do you like the taste? Lost in this head space <eos> It’s on loop like everyday <eos> Call me your saving grace <eos> Killing time with the band, understand it was all in our heads <eos> It’ll only get better <eos> So tell me - did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Twisted perceptions, weaved into new dimensions <eos> Like a brotherhood I knew that we’d pull through <eos> You’ve all been branded by the four three two crew <eos> Go <eos> Did I lose my mind? <eos> Fell out of orbit like a satellite <eos> Came crashing down without a sound <eos> But I’ll still light up the night sky <eos> One last time <eos> Can you save me? Can you save me? <eos> Or I’ll hit the ground <eos> Fell out of orbit right before it all came crashing down <eos> Did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Did I lose my mind? <eos> Fell out of orbit like a satellite <eos> Came crashing down without a sound <eos> But I’ll still light up the night sky <eos> One last time <eos> One last time <eos> 
I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall <eos> And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call <eos> It's just another call from home <eos> And you'll get it and be gone <eos> And I'll be crying <eos> And I'll be begging you, baby <eos> Beg you not to leave <eos> But I'll be left here waiting <eos> With my heart on my sleeve <eos> Oh, for the next time we'll be here <eos> Seems like a million years <eos> And I think I'm dying <eos> What do I have to do to make you see <eos> She can't love you like me? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> You keep telling me, baby <eos> There will come a time <eos> When you will leave her arms <eos> And forever be in mine <eos> But I don't think that's the truth <eos> And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting <eos> It's too much pain to have to bear <eos> To love a man you have to share <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> I can't take it any longer <eos> But my will is getting stronger <eos> And I think I know just what I have to do <eos> I can't waste another minute <eos> After all that I've put in it <eos> I've given you my best <eos> Why does she get the best of you <eos> So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm up off my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> You can't give me what I need <eos> When she begs you not to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> I don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay, yeah? <eos> 
It's a classic me mistake <eos> Someone gives me love, and I throw it all away <eos> Tell me, have I gone insane? <eos> Talkin' to myself, but I don't know what to say <eos> 'Cause you let go <eos> And now I'm holdin' on <eos> I guess you don't know what you got <eos> Until it's gone <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> So don't tell me it's too late <eos> Hearts are made to bend <eos> Baby, please don't let me break, yeah <eos> I knew I should've stayed <eos> 'Cause now, you're movin' on <eos> And I don't know what to say <eos> 'Cause you let go (Yeah, you let go) <eos> And now I'm holdin' on (I'm holdin' on) <eos> I guess you don't know what you got <eos> Until it's gone <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody (Somebody) <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, and I do, and I do, and I do, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody (Somebody) <eos> Just to find out you really love someone <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Sometimes, you gotta lose somebody <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> You gotta lose some <eos> You gotta lose somebody <eos> 
I wanted space, not destruction <eos> I wanted a river, not the ocean <eos> 'Cause when I break it down, down to nothing <eos> I know I want and who I am <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> I wanna be a rock, not an island <eos> I wanna be the answer, not the problem <eos> Seven sins a stolen glance, the big reveal, a second chance <eos> Trusted friend, a life unchained, forgiveness for mistakes we've made <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, let you love shine in now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, come on, let your light now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Yeah) <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> 
Standing tall feeling small horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb the mountain to breathe it <eos> You've spoken yet words fail us again <eos> Love language, language limits <eos> Sparkling twilight heart exploding horizons <eos> Flowering dreamscape slow descending I breathe in <eos> You give, you give yet words fail us again <eos> Love language lost in modern lives <eos> Mountains whisper, whisper, whisper <eos> Mountains whisper, mountains whisper <eos> Every word in all of history a million years of toil and folly <eos> None move more than mountains whispers you breathe in me <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb mountain to breathe in <eos> Though we dance we'll separate like oil and water <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> 
If you don't wanna see me, mm <eos> Did a full one-eighty <eos> Crazy, thinking 'bout the way I was <eos> Did the heartbreak change me? <eos> Maybe, but look at where I ended up <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not where you left me at all <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, yeah <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Aren't you the guy who tried to hurt me with the word "goodbye" <eos> Though it took some time to survive you <eos> I'm better on the othеr side <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not whеre you left me at all <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, yeah <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away, walk away, oh <eos> Don't start caring about me <eos> Walk away, walk away, oh <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, oh <eos> If you wanna believe that anything can stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> 
When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> When I wake each morning <eos> As the storm beats down on me <eos> And I know we belong together <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When we touch each other <eos> In a state of ecstasy <eos> Want this night to last forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> 
Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos> 
Losing time <eos> Thinking about you and nothing more <eos> I hang around <eos> There's nothing else I'm looking for <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> All those wishes <eos> That I made on stars for you <eos> They all fall down <eos> Fade away and it's so far from true <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Ev'rywhere you go <eos> Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again <eos> With candy canes and silver lanes that glow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in ev'ry store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots <eos> Is the wish of Barney and Ben <eos> Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk <eos> Is the hope of Janice and Jen <eos> Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Ev'rywhere you go <eos> There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well <eos> It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Soon the bells will start <eos> And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing <eos> Right within your heart <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in ev'ry store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> Sure it's Christmas, once a-more <eos> 
I'm gonna hit the highway and I never look back <eos> 'Cause you're just a memory I wish I never had <eos> When the walls close in it's time to get out <eos> Don't matter what's in front of me, I'll find a way round <eos> It don't matter no more <eos> I got my foot to the floor <eos> Like a bullet from a gun <eos> I was born to run <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> I ain't got nothing to lose 'cause I don't have nothin' <eos> Until I get where I'm going I'm gonna keep runnin' <eos> I might be insane, but I sure ain't scarred <eos> 'Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker and I just don't care <eos> It don't matter no more <eos> I got my foot to the floor <eos> Like a bullet from a gun <eos> I was born to run <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> 'Cause I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> 'Cause I'm breakin', breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' <eos> Breakin' <eos> OUT <eos> OF <eos> HELL <eos> 
Why should I have to beg for what is rightfully mine? <eos> While you sit back and wait for a comet to pass you by <eos> And you hold out your hands, in hopes that a future will fall right out of the sky <eos> But you will only find dread, as months turn to years fading out into hindsight <eos> Now I watch as the world unwinds <eos> And I bathe in the moonlight <eos> Where do I go from here? <eos> A roadmap of my passing prime <eos> Full of holes, it erodes, with my soul, and I’m bleeding <eos> I’ve been told that it’s all just prologue <eos> The afterlife is waiting for me <eos> But how do you know? <eos> When my fate has been on hold for so long <eos> I grow old, the window starts to close, and I can’t… <eos> Breathe, breathe in and fulfill your purpose <eos> Reduce the trees to a pile of leaves <eos> Burn them all to ash ’til you’re choking on the answer <eos> Though you may never be… <eos> Free, free from the disease that ails us <eos> Beyond the plague of uncertainty, waits the essence of my new reality <eos> With each and every trial, I learned how to be strong <eos> Endow my spirit with the strength to carry on <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> Knowledge of death brings us life <eos> Aging like a fine wine <eos> Until the well has run dry <eos> Marking the passage of time <eos> Need for expression comes in succession <eos> I’m here to take what is mine <eos> Nothing to hold me back if I don’t feel alive <eos> And now the planets align <eos> Drive all my focus into this moment <eos> Something’s in the water <eos> Just like any monster, it grows, and it grows tenfold <eos> The frozen ocean is brought to a boil <eos> Praying at the altar <eos> Just doesn’t compare to getting your own hands dirty <eos> Reality is a tangible thing <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> This is where I belong <eos> And in my fever dream <eos> Nothing is as it seems <eos> So ever-carefully I will roam <eos> Choices I never made <eos> Outcomes that I can’t change <eos> Let go of shame, and carry on <eos> I still carry the spark <eos> It guides me through the dark <eos> So in the frigid pain, I will roam <eos> With burdens in my arms <eos> I’m dreaming of a star <eos> Feels like a fantasy <eos> I’m not asleep <eos> 
You say you want to cry <eos> But your tears are dry <eos> When I was that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Now my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos> Still I wonder why <eos> Why he had to die <eos> When I feel that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Still my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos> 
Comin' back from the country <eos> Full of good food and lousy beer <eos> This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty <eos> At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd <eos> And it's anchors aweigh <eos> Looks like smooth sailin' <eos> But the merest hint of waves could capsize you <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's so easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> The desire for annihilation <eos> Is as common as it is unkind <eos> And it's hard to recognize the situation <eos> When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> Yeah, it's Christmas <eos> So no one can fix it <eos> 
I'm not afraid of standing still <eos> I'm just afraid of being bored <eos> I'm not afraid of speaking my mind <eos> I'm just afraid of being ignored <eos> I'm not afraid of feeling and I'm not afraid of trying <eos> I'm just afraid of losing and I am afraid of dying <eos> Without you, yes, I do and I hope that you do too <eos> Without you, yes, I do <eos> Without you, yes, I do and I hope that you do too <eos> Without you, yes, I <eos> I'm not afraid of being sick <eos> I'm more afraid of being well <eos> I'm not afraid, put the gun in my hand <eos> I'm just afraid it'll hurt like, hurt like hell <eos> I'm not afraid of screaming and I'm not afraid of crying <eos> I'm just afraid of forgetting and I am afraid of dying <eos> Without you, yes, I do and I hope that you do too <eos> Without you, yes, I do <eos> Without you, yes, I do and I hope that you do too <eos> Without you, yes, I <eos> Fear <eos> Fear <eos> Fear <eos> Fear <eos> I'm not afraid of looking ugly <eos> I couldn't care what they say <eos> I'm not afraid of happy endings <eos> I'm just afraid my life won't work that way <eos> I'm not afraid of forgiveness <eos> I'll absolve you everything <eos> I'm not afraid of lying, but I am afraid of dying <eos> Without you, yes, I do and I hope that you do too <eos> Without you, yеs, I do <eos> Without you, all I do is sit and think about you <eos> Without you, yes, I <eos> 
Hello, I've waited here for you <eos> Everlong <eos> Tonight, I throw myself into <eos> And out of the red <eos> Out of her head, she sang <eos> Come down, and waste away with me <eos> Down with me <eos> Slow how you wanted it to be <eos> I'm over my head <eos> Out of her head, she sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> When I sing along with you <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> She sang <eos> Breathe out, so I can breathe you in <eos> Hold you in <eos> And now I know you've always been <eos> And out of your head, out of my head I sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> When I sing along with you <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> She sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> 
Frosty the snowman <eos> Was a jolly happy soul <eos> With a corncob pipe and a button nose <eos> And two eyes made out of coal <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Is a fairytale they say <eos> He was made of snow <eos> But the children know <eos> How he came to life one day <eos> There must have been some magic <eos> In that old silk hat they found <eos> For when they placed it on his head <eos> He began to dance around <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Was alive as he could be <eos> And the children say <eos> He could laugh and play <eos> Just the same as you and me <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Knew the sun was hot that day <eos> So he said let's run <eos> And we'll have some fun <eos> Now before I melt away <eos> Down to the village <eos> With a broomstick in his hand <eos> Running here and there all around the square <eos> Saying catch me if you can <eos> He led them down the streets of town <eos> Right to the traffic cop <eos> And he only paused a moment when <eos> He heard him holler stop <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Had to hurry on his way <eos> But he waved goodbye <eos> Saying don't you cry <eos> I'll be back again some day <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Look at frosty go <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Over the hills of snow <eos> 
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness <eos> By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages <eos> Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone <eos> And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone <eos> And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels <eos> Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven <eos> To a place I recall, I was there so long ago <eos> The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone, alone <eos> And on I read until the day was gone <eos> And I sat in regret of all the things I've done <eos> For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged <eos> In dreams until my death, I will wander on <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone, alone <eos> 
Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know I'm just a flight away <eos> If you want it, you could take a private plane <eos> A kilómetros estamos conectando <eos> Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando <eos> You know I got a lot to say <eos> All these voices in the background of my brain <eos> Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando <eos> Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know that I can see right through you <eos> I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> What you wanna do? <eos> It's written all over your face, times two <eos> 'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> I can hear your thoughts like a melody <eos> Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep <eos> You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe <eos> (On repeat) <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> (You know I got a lot to say) <eos> (All these voices in the background of my brain) <eos>

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me <eos> And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see <eos> It aches in every bone <eos> I'll die alone, but not for you <eos> My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing <eos> I know it's me, you fear <eos> If you want me, hold me back <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale <eos> The pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high <eos> Just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away <eos> So come, sit by the fire and play a while <eos> But you can't stay too long <eos> It aches in every bone <eos> I'll die alone, but not for pleasure <eos> I see my heart explode <eos> It's been eroded by the weather here <eos> If you want me, hold me back <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Hold your eyes closed, take me in <eos> Hold your eyes closed, take me in <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos>

Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul <eos> He said I'm there before my time <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> I'm running out of reasons to start up a conversation with you <eos> Usually, I'd be the first to run to your defense <eos> But this time, I can't even come up with an excuse <eos> Tengo que vivir un día a la vez, poco a poco <eos> Otherwise, I'd lose my head <eos> And I'd start doubting everything that I believe in <eos> Believe me (No, no, no, no) <eos> Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul (Old soul) <eos> He said I'm there before my time (Time) <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> You push me to a side, why do I wait <eos> For you to come around and talk again? <eos> Mess with my mind, I'll move myself out of your way <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> I'd just rather not confront them because then they bring us problems <eos> And they're always in the back of my head <eos> Are you bored yet? Are you leaving? <eos> It's kinda shifted, I feel the difference <eos> Don't want attachment to you, no <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> Just yet, mm <eos>

The tree of life my soul hath seen <eos> Laden with fruit, and always green: <eos> The trees of nature fruitless be <eos> Compared with Christ the apple tree <eos> His beauty doth all things excel: <eos> By faith I know, but ne'er can tell <eos> The glory which I now can see <eos> In Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> For happiness I long have sought <eos> And pleasure dearly I have bought: <eos> I missed of all; but now I see <eos> 'Tis found in Christ the apple tree <eos> I'm weary with my former toil <eos> Here I will sit and rest awhile: <eos> Under the shadow I will be <eos> Of Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> This fruit doth make my soul to thrive <eos> It keeps my dying faith alive; <eos> Which makes my soul in haste to be <eos> With Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos>

Road trippin' with my two favorite allies <eos> Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies <eos> It's time to leave this town, it's time to steal away <eos> Let's go get lost anywhere in the USA <eos> Let's go get lost, let's go get lost <eos> Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one <eos> Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> These smiling eyes are just a mirror for <eos> So much has come before those battles lost and won <eos> This life is shining more forever in the sun <eos> Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf <eos> Staying high and dry's more trouble than it's worth in the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> These smiling eyes are just a mirror for <eos> In Big Sur we take some time to linger on <eos> We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on <eos> Now let us drink the stars, it's time to steal away <eos> Let's go get lost right here in the USA <eos> Let's go get lost, let's go get lost <eos> Blue, you sit so pretty west of the one <eos> Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> Just a mirror for the sun <eos> These smiling eyes are just a mirror for <eos> These smiling eyes are just a mirror for <eos> Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for <eos> 
I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I see a line of cars and they're all painted black <eos> With flowers and my love, both never to come back <eos> I see people turn their heads and quickly look away <eos> Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day <eos> I look inside myself and see my heart is black <eos> I see my red door, I must have it painted black <eos> Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts <eos> It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black <eos> No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue <eos> I could not foresee this thing happening to you <eos> If I look hard enough into the setting sun <eos> My love will laugh with me before the morning comes <eos> I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted black <eos> Black as night, black as coal <eos> I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black <eos> Yeah <eos> 
There's another world inside of me that you may never see <eos> There's secrets in this life that I can't hide <eos> But somewhere in this darkness <eos> There's a light that I can't find <eos> Well maybe it's too far away, yeah <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When your education x-ray <eos> Cannot see under my skin <eos> I won't tell you a damn thing <eos> That I could not tell my friends <eos> Roaming through this darkness <eos> I'm alive, but I'm alone <eos> And part of me is fighting this <eos> But part of me is gone <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos>

I sat by the ocean <eos> And drank a potion, baby, to erase you <eos> Face down in the boulevard <eos> Yet, I couldn't face you <eos> There ain't no use in crying <eos> It doesn't change anything <eos> So, baby, what good does it do? <eos> Your friends, they all sympathize <eos> Maybe I don’t need them to <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead, I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> There's nowhere to run away <eos> Said, "Boy, if you want love <eos> You'll have to go and find it with someone new <eos> Do you know who you really are <eos> Are you sure it's really you?" <eos> Lies are a funny thing <eos> They slip through your fingertips <eos> Because they never happened to you <eos> Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> Into the light, left with nowhere to hide <eos> Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night <eos>

In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> 
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen <eos> Pour myself a cup of ambition <eos> Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life <eos> Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin' <eos> Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin' <eos> With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, for service and devotion <eos> You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion <eos> Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me <eos> I swear sometimes that man is out to get me <eos> Mmmmm... <eos> They let you dream just to watch them shatter <eos> You're just a step on the boss man's ladder <eos> But you got dreams he'll never take away <eos> In the same boat with a lot of your friends <eos> Waiting for the day your ship will come in <eos> And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and you never get the credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos> 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos> 
Every Sunday I see people <eos> Filing in through those front doors <eos> Got a cross up on that steeple <eos> Yeah, it's time to praise the Lord <eos> Some watch it on their TV <eos> Sittin' on the couch <eos> Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out <eos> Oh, ain't got too many miles to go <eos> To save my soul <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Now there ain't nothing wrong <eos> With puttin' on your Sunday best <eos> Me, I won't be wearin' <eos> Nothin' that I can't get wet <eos> I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone <eos> I'm out here by myself, but I know I'm not alone <eos> Yeah, I got all the proof I need <eos> And it sure makes me believe <eos> When I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Amen <eos> I'm in heaven watching all these waves roll in <eos> Amen <eos> When I'm lost I know where to get found again <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos>

My mind's a leech, and I feel so weak <eos> My sleep was deep, and I did not dream <eos> There is a presence here, breathing life into our fears <eos> Russian roulette, the cylinder is full, no gods to interfere <eos> Requiem, this will destroy you <eos> Before you mourn the passing dream <eos> Requiem, this night won't conclude <eos> House of glass crashes down around you <eos> Spread of self-violence <eos> Complicit in silence <eos> Desire's subsidence <eos> Survive by dеfiance against defeat <eos> Burn it down <eos> Sweep of a nation misguidеd by a righteous hand <eos> Distorted divine <eos> Collective suicide <eos> Turbines aflame, like monolithic candles incandescent <eos> In a midnight aura, convulsing bodies in a ritual <eos> My sleep was deep, and I did not dream <eos> Burn it down, burn it down <eos> Pitch black mass <eos> House of glass <eos> Requiem, this will destroy you <eos> Before you mourn the passing dream <eos> Requiem, this night won't conclude <eos> House of glass crashes down around you <eos> Battered, battered and scarred <eos> Post-fundamentalist humiliation <eos> Scattered, scattered and starved <eos> Post-indoctrination <eos> Pitch black mass <eos> House of glass <eos> Burn, burn, burn it <eos> Burn, burn, burn it down <eos> Burn, burn it down <eos> This will destroy you <eos> Burn it down <eos> Burn it to the fucking ground <eos> 
There is hope for us <eos> There is distance between you and I <eos> We have just enough <eos> And it comes as no surprise <eos> I was in between <eos> You were matches and kerosene <eos> Is your conscience clear? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Did you celebrate without me? <eos> Did you tell them all about me? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Does it get you off <eos> To get it off your chest? <eos> Such an awful year <eos> Such an awful mess <eos> You can't write <eos> You can't sing <eos> You can't do anything at all <eos> Is there someone here? <eos> Can you make the call? <eos> Please, make the call <eos> And the ambulance is here <eos> And if I haven't made it clear... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Is there hope for us? <eos> There are constants that we can't define <eos> Is it all used up? <eos> Are we out of time? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> Well, if you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Now, the ambulance is here <eos> And if I still haven't made it clear <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> 
Remember when Hell had frozen over? <eos> The cold still burns underneath my skin <eos> The water is rising all around me <eos> And there is nothing left I can give <eos> All these tears I've shed <eos> I saw the wildfire spread <eos> You said you cheated death <eos> But Heaven was in my head <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> The embers still glow when I'm sober <eos> The gold in the flame burns brighter now <eos> I have to rebuild, now it's over <eos> Maybe now I'm lost, I can live <eos> Souls don't break, they bend <eos> But I sometimes forget <eos> I have to do this for you <eos> And the only way out is through <eos> Yeah, death is an open door <eos> Words the prophets said <eos> Still swimming through my head <eos> Now there's no stars left in the sky <eos> 'Cause this well will never run dry <eos> What if I completely forget? <eos> What if I never accept? <eos> 'Cause when you fade away <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> Yeah <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos>

In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos>

Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos> Si este amor fuera imposible <eos> Un deseo, un delirio intangible <eos> Viviría en la rutina de vivir <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si el amor no es el remedio <eos> Para que esta el corazón en el pecho <eos> Para que existen las rosas y el jardín <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos>

Oh! <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> Way too many heads, need a steady view <eos> Smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous <eos> Never meant to cross you <eos> But my jaw hit the floor with the one, two <eos> Think I want you <eos> You say this ain't love, but it's still the same love <eos> Make love, anything to sate ya <eos> Don't be shy, you decide <eos> Say, can I make you mine? <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (If you say it's alright) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> (Ah) Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine (Ah) <eos> Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> No, oh, oh <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> His love never felt right (Ah) <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> (Don't lie, baby, don't lie) <eos> 
Call you up in the middle of the night <eos> Like a firefly without a light <eos> You were there like a blowtorch burning <eos> I was a key that could use a little turning <eos> So tired that I couldn't even sleep <eos> So many secrets I couldn't keep <eos> Promised myself I wouldn't weep <eos> One more promise I couldn't keep <eos> It seems no one can help me now <eos> I'm in too deep <eos> There's no way out <eos> This time I have really led myself astray <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Can you help me remember how to smile? <eos> Make it somehow all seem worthwhile <eos> How on earth did I get so jaded? <eos> Life's mystery seems so faded <eos> I can go where no one else can go <eos> I know what no one else knows <eos> Here I am, just drowning in the rain <eos> With a ticket for a runaway train <eos> And everything seems cut and dry <eos> Day and night <eos> Earth and sky <eos> Somehow I just don't believe it <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Bought a ticket for a runaway train <eos> Like a madman laughing at the rain <eos> A little out of touch, a little insane <eos> It's just easier than dealing with the pain <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Runaway train never coming back <eos> Runaway train tearing up the track <eos> Runaway train burning in my veins <eos> Runaway but it always seems the same <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> 
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen <eos> Said "don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one?" <eos> Who will dance on the floor in the round? <eos> She says I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round <eos> She said her name was Billie Jean, and she caused a scene <eos> Every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one <eos> Who will dance on the floor in the round? <eos> People always told me be careful what you do <eos> Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts <eos> Mother always told me be careful who you love <eos> Be careful what you do before the lie becomes the truth <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who said that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> For forty days and forty nights the law was on her side <eos> Who could can stand when she's in demand <eos> Her schemes and her plans <eos> 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round <eos> So take my strong advice <eos> And remember to always think twice <eos> Do think twice <eos> She told my baby that we danced till three <eos> And she looked at me, showed a photo of my baby crying <eos> His eyes were like mine <eos> 'Cause we dance on the floor in the round <eos> People always told me be careful what you do <eos> Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts <eos> Then she stood right by me, the smell of sweet perfume <eos> This happened much too soon, but she called me to her room <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who says that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who says that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son <eos> So take my strong advice <eos> And remember to always think twice <eos> Do think twice <eos> 
The way you look when you cry make me wanna confess to you <eos> The way you wear that dress, like it couldn't mean less to you <eos> And there's no reason, keeping secrets <eos> Maybe regret is a weakness <eos> But all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> Don't wanna come home late and make a mistake for you <eos> It's easier to let a heart wait than make a heart break for you <eos> I gave you pieces of my secrets like religion to believe in <eos> And all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else, somebody else <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh (Make a heart break for you) <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah, yeah <eos>

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> 
I just want you close <eos> Where you can stay forever <eos> You can be sure <eos> That it will only get better <eos> You and me together <eos> Through the days and nights <eos> I don't worry 'cause <eos> Everything's going to be alright <eos> People keep talking, they can say what they like <eos> But all I know is everything's gonna be alright <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you <eos> When the rain is pouring down <eos> And my heart is hurting <eos> You will always be around <eos> This I know for certain <eos> You and me together <eos> Through the days and nights <eos> I don't worry 'cause <eos> Everything's going to be alright <eos> People keep talking, they can say what they like <eos> But all I know is everything's gonna be alright <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel <eos> I know some people search the world <eos> To find something like what we have <eos> I know people will try, try to divide, something so real <eos> So till the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one <eos> No one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you <eos> Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <eos> Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <eos> 
There are days <eos> I wake up and I pinch myself <eos> You're with me, not someone else <eos> And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared <eos> That it's all a dream <eos> 'Cause you still look perfect as days go by <eos> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <eos> I'd stop the world if it gave us time <eos> 'Cause when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> When you say <eos> You love the way I make you feel <eos> Everything becomes so real <eos> Don't be scared, no, don't be scared <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> And you still look perfect as days go by <eos> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <eos> I'd stop the world if it gave us time <eos> 'Cause when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> All my life <eos> I thought it'd be hard to find <eos> The one, 'til I found you <eos> And I find it bittersweet <eos> 'Cause you gave me something to lose <eos> But when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos>

Wouldn't you know <eos> Those brown eyes <eos> See a side of me <eos> Nobody knows <eos> Nobody knows but you <eos> I wanna go <eos> Go wherever your thoughts lead <eos> Your treasures you hold <eos> Why don't you show the truth <eos> 'Cause what I've seen so far is heaven sent <eos> Eloquent and decadent <eos> Every drop you send my way I hold on, babe <eos> I'd live this whole damn life all over again <eos> Just to meet you once again <eos> Every second, minute, hour still in place <eos> 'Cause you've always been mine <eos> You've always been mine <eos> You've always been <eos> Would you believe <eos> Looked all ovеr creation <eos> When you had the kеys <eos> Standing in front of me <eos> How could it be <eos> Almost gave up completely <eos> But love wouldn't leave <eos> Love wanted me to see <eos> 'Cause what I've seen so far is heaven sent <eos> Eloquent and decadent <eos> Every drop you send my way I hold on, babe <eos> I'd live this whole damn life all over again <eos> Just to meet you once again <eos> Every second, minute, hour still in place <eos> 'Cause you've always been mine <eos> You've always been mine <eos> You've always been <eos> 
Carry on, look at my phone <eos> Set it down, I'm all alone <eos> Get my shoes, take a breath <eos> See your face in everything <eos> Out the door, don't know what for <eos> Maybe there is something more <eos> I close my eyes, I travel miles <eos> I'm still lost, I wonder why <eos> I can't seem to get you out my head <eos> Feel your kiss with every single breath <eos> I've drank the wine, I've took the drugs <eos> But nothing ever is enough <eos> I don't eat, haven't for days <eos> Punish myself (Punish myself), in different ways <eos> Maybe then, I'll finally know <eos> What it was (What it was), that made you go (Made you go) <eos> I look up (I look up), into the sky (Into the sky) <eos> I ask myself (I ask myself), and I wonder why <eos> I can't seem to get you out my head <eos> Feel your kiss with every single breath <eos> Uh <eos> Me and my brother we were cool when we were younger <eos> Until the pull of all that drugging took him under (Under) <eos> Nothing could satisfy the darkness in his hunger <eos> Yo 'cause first you feel the lightning go <eos> But then you hear the thunder <eos> It was louder than you ever could imagine <eos> Couldn't have fathomed the pain 'til the day you see it happen <eos> Yo I was sitting in a shitty pub in Clapham <eos> Trying to find a way to tame the fire breathing dragon <eos> I can't seem to get you out my head (My head) <eos> Feel your kiss with every single breath (Single breath) <eos> I can't seem to get you out my head (I can't seem to get you out my head) <eos> Feel your kiss with every single breath <eos> Oh, oh-oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah-ah, ah-ah <eos> 
Knew by the first touch <eos> The first glance <eos> My first blush <eos> That I was something special <eos> I was someone you couldn’t touch <eos> Unless you worked and made it happen <eos> Then the whole thing became different <eos> It's my life I wanna live it <eos> If it's yours then it's your business <eos> Blurry eyes and a Discman that still works <eos> Yeah it hurts <eos> When it shatters in a million pieces first <eos> I can tell the way that I knew I was different <eos> Trying to mingle but when I talk no one listens <eos> But my eyes can glisten <eos> They can cry all they want and I can hide all day long <eos> How is it that a child can feel like he don't belong <eos> I kept my chin up and I did a bunch of drugs <eos> I don't regret it now but I know I had enough <eos> It's all these years where we just tried to fill a void <eos> At least we weren’t alone smoking weed <eos> Paranoid <eos> Unknown pills from parents' bathrooms our noses like vacuums <eos> Up all night on the chat rooms chatting away with Matthew <eos> And all these years where we just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> Countless nights star gazing <eos> Holy dope that we are blazing <eos> New feelings it's amazing <eos> Kisses by the water <eos> I'm an unruly daughter <eos> Yeah I make her wanna slap her <eos> But she knows that I love her <eos> I feel a lot and sometimes it just gets too much <eos> My breathing changes and my neck it tingles <eos> I get a rush <eos> It's adrenaline <eos> I'm in survival mode <eos> I fucking hate it <eos> But it's my normal mode <eos> Gotta learn gotta live <eos> Another day <eos> Are you feeling fine <eos> Yeah I'm okay <eos> I got 5 on it though <eos> Were 4 on a blunt <eos> I know you think it's too much <eos> But we broke, we wanna smoke <eos> And we just tried to fill a avoid <eos> So many things we want to avoid <eos> And we just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> 
He was born in the summer of his 27th year <eos> Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before <eos> He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again <eos> You might say he found a key for every door <eos> When he first came to the mountains his life was far away <eos> On the road and hangin’ by a song <eos> But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care <eos> It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long <eos> But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below <eos> He saw everything as far as you can see <eos> And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun <eos> And he lost a friend but kept the memory <eos> Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams <eos> Seeking grace in every step he takes <eos> His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand <eos> The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake <eos> And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Talk to God and listen to the casual reply <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear <eos> Of the simple thing he cannot comprehend <eos> Why they try to tear the mountains down <eos> To bring in a couple more <eos> More people, more scars upon the land <eos> And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw eagles fly <eos> Rocky Mountain high <eos> The Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Friends around the campfire and everybody's high (high  high) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> 
When I get off of this mountain <eos> You know where I want to go <eos> Straight down the Mississippi river <eos> To the Gulf of Mexico <eos> To Lake Charles Louisiana <eos> Little Bessie, girl that I once knew <eos> She told me just to come on by <eos> If there's anything that she could do <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> Good luck had just stung me <eos> To the race track I did go <eos> She bet on one horse to win <eos> And I bet on another to show <eos> The odds were in my favor <eos> I had 'em five to one <eos> When that nag to win came around the track <eos> Sure enough we had won <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> I took up all of my winnings <eos> And I gave my little Bessie half <eos> And she tore it up and threw it in my face <eos> Just for a laugh <eos> Now there's one thing in the whole wide world <eos> I sure love to see <eos> That's when that little love of mine <eos> Dips her doughnut in my tea <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> Now me and my mate were back at the shack <eos> We had Spike Jones on the box <eos> She said, "I can't take the way he sings <eos> But I love to hear him talk" <eos> Now that just gave my heart a throb <eos> To the bottom of my feet <eos> And I swore as I took another pull <eos> My Bessie can't be beat <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> As there's a flood out in California <eos> And up North it's freezing cold <eos> And this living on the road <eos> Is getting pretty old <eos> So I guess, I'll call up my big mama <eos> Tell her I'll be rolling in <eos> But you know, deep down <eos> I'm kind of tempted <eos> To go and see my Bessie again <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> 
In my mind, I'm going to Carolina <eos> Can't you see the sunshine? <eos> Now can't you just feel the moonshine? <eos> And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind? <eos> Yes, I'm going to Carolina in my mind <eos> Karen, she's a silver sun <eos> You best walk her way and watch it shine <eos> Watch her watch the morning come <eos> A silver tear appearing now I'm crying, ain't I? <eos> I'm going to Carolina in my mind <eos> There ain't no doubt in no one's mind <eos> That love's the finest thing around <eos> Whisper something soft and kind <eos> And hey, baby, the sky's on fire, I'm dying, ain't I? <eos> I'm going to Carolina in my mind <eos> In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina <eos> Can't you see the sunshine? <eos> Now can't you just feel the moonshine? <eos> And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind? <eos> Yes, I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind <eos> Dark and silent late last night <eos> I think I might have heard the highway call <eos> Geese in flight and dogs that bite <eos> The signs that might be omens say I'm going, going <eos> Gone to Carolina in my mind <eos> Now where holy host of others standing around me <eos> Still I'm on the dark side of the moon <eos> And it looks like it goes on like this forever <eos> You must forgive me <eos> If its up and gone to Carolina in my mind <eos> In my mind I'm gone to Carolina <eos> Can't you see the sunshine? <eos> Can't you just feel the moonshine? <eos> And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind? <eos> Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind <eos> In my mind, I'm gone to Carolina <eos> Can't you see the sunshine? <eos> Now can't you just feel the moonshine? <eos> And ain't it just like a friend of mine to hit me from behind? <eos> Yes, I'm gone to Carolina in my mind <eos> Gotta make it back home again soon <eos> Gotta get back to Carolina soon <eos> Gotta make it back to my home again soon <eos> Oh no, gotta get back to Carolina soon <eos> Carolina, yeah <eos> Gotta get back home soon <eos> I can't travel no more, baby <eos> Gotta get back home again <eos> Gotta get back to Carolina soon <eos> Gotta get back on home again soon <eos> Gotta get back home <eos>

Force my feet to keep on moving <eos> Sounds so sweet when the beat starts grooving <eos> Time flies by, but life is such <eos> I've been thinking that I drink too much <eos> I hold my breath but I'm still breathing <eos> Life or death, it never come too easy <eos> Bide my time 'til the well runs dry <eos> I let the sun rays turn a dark soul bright <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine <eos> They said everything will be just fine <eos> I give my best and I give my all <eos> Feel like everything's all my fault <eos> Time stands still, but the clock keeps spinning <eos> I close my eyes and get lost for a minute <eos> The words and the tears, they have long dried up <eos> I think I thought that I'd had enough <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> Had a dream I was flying <eos> Where I go when I want to be free <eos> All this time I've been trying <eos> To escape to the place where I belong <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> 
I was at the beach, sittin on the sand <eos> When I saw this girl, dark brown eyes and a dark olive tan <eos> She was watching the sets with a surfboard underneath her arm <eos> The first moment I saw her I knew she'd do me some harm <eos> (She's so good) <eos> She came out of the water with the best session I'd seen <eos> Man she had the biggest chi-chi's I had ever seen <eos> She put down her board, and sat down next to me <eos> And played a soft ole lonely tune on her ukulele <eos> I dont know what had happened, but I'd fallen asleep <eos> The next morning I woke up, she was sleeping next to me <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> She got out of bed and waxed up both our boards <eos> Grabbed me by the hand and then she took me out the door <eos> We surfed all that day long, at least eight hours straight <eos> Man I knew that she was the one and damn I couldn't wait <eos> Well I asked if she loved me <eos> She said, "Yea well I guess" <eos> So I asked her to marry me, dammit you know she said "Yes" <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> I was at the alter, in my tuxedo-o-o <eos> Waiting for my surfer girl, man where did she go? <eos> Later on that day, a friend of me did tell-ell-ell <eos> That she went to Mexico <eos> To catch a, to catch a, to catch a 10 foot swell <eos> Ah That Bitch! <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> My surfer girl <eos> 
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <eos> Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife <eos> And if it was an open-shut case <eos> I never would've known from that look on your face <eos> Lost in your current like a priceless wine <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in <eos> As if you were a mythical thing <eos> Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <eos> And there was one prize I'd cheat to win <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> They count me out time and time again <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> But I come back stronger than a '90s trend <eos> Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark <eos> Show me the places where the others gave you scars <eos> Now this is an open-shut case <eos> I guess I should've known from the look on your face <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> That's my man <eos> Yeah, that's my man <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> That's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> 
You broke me first <eos> Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a while, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first (You broke me first) <eos> You broke me first, ooh oh <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> 
Nothing's wrong, and it's not what I'm used to <eos> Oh, does it surprise you too? <eos> When it's simple, is it easier than it should be? <eos> Nothing's wrong, but when you're not in my arms <eos> I send voice notes, you send hearts <eos> And get quiet, and I know that means you miss me <eos> You're jealous, you shouldn't be <eos> I want you obsessively <eos> But I know how complicated it can get <eos> When you're not in front of me <eos> I know insecurities get in your head <eos> But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes, get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Nothing's wrong, I just get in my head too <eos> Can you reassure me you, you're still in it? <eos> I just wish you could lean in and kiss me <eos> Say nothing's wrong, tell me to settle down <eos> You do it better than I've ever known how <eos> Won't pull some tricks for attention <eos> But could I get a little now? <eos> I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> You're jealous, you shouldn't be <eos> I want you obsessively <eos> But I know how complicated it can get <eos> When you're not in front of me <eos> I know insecurities get in your head <eos> But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times before 7 AM <eos> I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times before 7 AM <eos> I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos>

Usually a drink will do the trick <eos> Take the edge off quick, sittin' in the dark <eos> With a shared cigarette <eos> Seeing eye-to-eye and heart-to-heart <eos> But maybe I'm just gettin' old <eos> Used to work, but now it don't <eos> A long gone drive <eos> You know the kind where you take a turn <eos> And you don't know why <eos> But it clears your mind, a surefire cure <eos> I need somethin' stronger <eos> That'll last a little longer <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> I wish I didn't know so much <eos> I peeked behind the curtain <eos> Now that magic rush <eos> Feels like a trick that isn't workin' <eos> But I haven't lost all hope yet <eos> Yeah, it's hurtin', but it ain't dead <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason <eos> Just somethin' that I can believe in <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> 
Heading down south to the land of the pines <eos> I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline <eos> Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights <eos> I made it down the coast in seventeen hours <eos> Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers <eos> And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Running from the cold up in New England <eos> I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band <eos> My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now <eos> Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down <eos> Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town <eos> But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Walking to the south out of Roanoke <eos> I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke <eos> But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap <eos> To Johnson City, Tennessee <eos> And I got to get a move on before the sun <eos> I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one <eos> And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> You can rock me <eos> Rock me <eos>

You would use your songs to say <eos> The words you couldn't say <eos> And every word you sang <eos> Was about you and me <eos> I loved everything you've wrote <eos> And when you would sing <eos> I felt that my heart was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> And with Cristal and pink champagne <eos> On our wedding day <eos> You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us <eos> Then you got on top of it <eos> And you sang to me <eos> As the snow was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> 
When the lights are low <eos> I'm alone with the feeling <eos> Can you be the relief I can't find <eos> 'cause I don't know the answer sometimes <eos> Can I take control <eos> And hold on to believing <eos> Yeah I know it can look like I'm trying <eos> Though I can't seem to make up my mind <eos> Let's go <eos> To another coast <eos> Take me somewhere we can be alone <eos> Baby there where we get comfortable <eos> There's nothing to lose except our clothes <eos> And I really wanna let you know <eos> That I can never let you go <eos> 'cause I just wanna be only yours <eos> And maybe I'll surrender <eos> 'cause loving you is better <eos> It's not worth it to fight it <eos> I'm giving up <eos> Let's go <eos> To another coast <eos> Take me somewhere we can be alone <eos> Baby there where we get comfortable <eos> There's nothing to lose except our clothes <eos> And I really wanna let you know <eos> That I can never let you go <eos> 'cause I just wanna be only yours <eos> Entre truenos y tormentas <eos> Fue la calma que existía entre nosotros <eos> Lo que nos dejó fluir <eos> 
It's somewhere lost <eos> Forever more <eos> My demons come for me <eos> When they hear my voice <eos> Ooh you <eos> La da da da da <eos> Oooh <eos> Avoid some day <eos> Smoke with you the other day <eos> We can love (love) oh <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> Avoid some day <eos> Smoke with you the other day <eos> We can love oh <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> I really wanna talk to you <eos> How can I talk to you <eos> I caught your eye across the room <eos> Do we even need the truth for now <eos> How can I talk to you <eos> Our loving we should resume <eos> I fall in love <eos> Your perfume <eos> 
The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> I don't know that much about Kingston <eos> But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain <eos> I think that tonight I'll leave my light on <eos> 'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you <eos> Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way <eos> It's the thought of you that slightly scares me <eos> But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say <eos> The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> 
Loving you is a mountain <eos> We don't have breath in our lungs <eos> The higher up we go is the problem <eos> So maybe we should fly to the sun <eos> I just don't believe we can function <eos> There is no life if there's an absence of blood <eos> And I don't even feel our hearts beating <eos> So maybe there is an absence of love <eos> 
We could be a gunfighter <eos> Unlatching all the bailing wire <eos> Eloise, lemme see your sweet face <eos> Come, face me <eos> Chin up, we're young & in the dark <eos> We saw him resurrect in a muscle car <eos> There was an oracle <eos> We heard there was a light show <eos> Hotter than a June kiss <eos> I'm blushing a shade of licorice <eos> Croon with your night lungs <eos> That old Cicada love song <eos> Holy broken heart <eos> A meaning-well American abattoir <eos> You're around us, oh <eos> Be around us <eos> Someone close our eyes <eos> Make it so that we can find you <eos> In our imagination, a magic eye <eos> In the photo under, we look like a gunfighter <eos> Modeled after Autry <eos> Maybe Annie O <eos> And we can trick-shoot bottles <eos> And everyone aims slow <eos> Oh, c'mon, be a gunfighter, baby <eos> With you <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos> For always <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos> Oh, oh, ooh <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos>

If there was anyone I'd want <eos> To spend about a hundred days with <eos> Laying in the yard, staring up at stars <eos> Wondering where all the planes went <eos> It would be you, only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms, in my arms (oh-oh) <eos> And we'll leave on the news until <eos> The broadcast stops broadcasting <eos> Yes, making drinks instead of plans <eos> While the record player's blasting <eos> I sing, it would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> And when the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> If the sky turns black, if the markets crash <eos> You should check your mom's house <eos> And then you should come back <eos> Cause when it all goes down <eos> I want you by my side <eos> We could stay up till the last sunrise <eos> We could stay up until the last sunrise <eos> It would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We can keep on dancing in the dark, in the dark, in the dark <eos> It would be you till the end of the world <eos> Till the end of the world, yeah <eos> Cause if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> 
Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing <eos> You’re like Parker Posey in a magazine <eos> With fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three <eos> I wanna be your dressed in black <eos> Your dark star with the backwards hat <eos> I’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page <eos> Every page <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> I was a desert, honey you were the sand <eos> I was a bird, baby you were the branch <eos> And I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die <eos> It wasn't much, just everything <eos> You could've sat right there and got high with me <eos> But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares <eos> Brought the nightmares <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos>

I figured it out <eos> I figured it out from black and white <eos> Seconds and hours <eos> Maybe they had to take some time <eos> I know how it goes <eos> I know how it goes from wrong and right <eos> Silence and sound <eos> Did they ever hold each other tight like us? <eos> Did they ever fight like us? <eos> You and I, we don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end <eos> Nothing can come between you and I <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us <eos> No, nothing can come between you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> I figured it out <eos> Saw the mistakes of up and down <eos> Meet in the middle <eos> There's always room for common ground <eos> I see what it's like <eos> I see what it's like for day and night <eos> Never together <eos> 'Cause they see things in a different light like us <eos> They never tried like us <eos> You and I, we don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end <eos> Nothing can come between you and I <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us <eos> (Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us) <eos> 'Cause you and I <eos> We don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end (until the end) <eos> Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between) <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us (two of us) <eos> No, nothing can come between you and I <eos> You and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> We could make it if we try, you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> 
To be young and in love in New York City <eos> To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me <eos> To be drunk and in love in New York City <eos> Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I don't know what it is but I got that feeling <eos> Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling <eos> If we lay, let the day just pass us by <eos> I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Lay here with me, ooh <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Yes I do, yes I do, babe) <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Oooh noo) <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> (I like me, I like me) <eos> (Look who you made me, made me, oh noo) <eos> Better when <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> 
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain <eos> I leave my heart open <eos> But it stays right here empty for days <eos> She told me in the morning <eos> She don't feel the same about us in her bones <eos> It seems to me that when I die <eos> These words will be written on my stone <eos> And I'll be gone, gone tonight <eos> The ground beneath my feet is open wide <eos> The way that I've been holding on too tight <eos> With nothing in between <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen (The story of, the story of) <eos> The story of my life <eos> I give her hope <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change <eos> Leave my heart open <eos> But it stays right here in its cage <eos> I know that in the morning, now <eos> I'll see us in the light up on the hill <eos> Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still <eos> And I'll be gone, gone tonight <eos> The fire beneath my feet is burning bright <eos> The way that I've been holding on so tight <eos> With nothing in between <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> I give her hope <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> And I been waiting for this time to come around <eos> But, baby, running after you <eos> Is like chasing the clouds <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen <eos> The story of my life <eos> I give her hope (Give her hope) <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> (Until she's broke inside) <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos>

Oh, Miles you changed this life for good <eos> It spins in ways I never thought it could <eos> Take all that we have grown and watch how it still blooms <eos> Though I’m far from you <eos> Oh, Miles, I wish you could have stayed <eos> Not only ‘cause I feel you’re hurt the same <eos> We push and pull and tried to stop the rain that left us soaked <eos> I miss you the most <eos> Oh, Miles, where did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Oh, Miles, I hope you find the girl <eos> That sends a shiver through your world <eos> To watch the moment the sun disappears behind thе hill <eos> Our little world so still <eos> Oh, Miles, wherе did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> 
I've been holding my breath <eos> I've  been counting to ten <eos> Over  something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm  alone in bed <eos> You  know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So  tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause  you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
Wake up, man, I hate the front door <eos> Tell myself, "Go out more" <eos> End up in the same bed, lonely <eos> Feels like every day is wasted <eos> Like I'm on a wait list <eos> For someone to really know me <eos> I don't know where you're from <eos> I don't care if it's real <eos> 'Cause I like the way you talk <eos> The way you feel <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> I've been driving with the breaks on <eos> Taking all the turns wrong <eos> But if it brought me here, I'm not mad <eos> Tеll me this don't happen often <eos> Got you ditching your friеnds <eos> You say that you never do that <eos> I don't know where you're from <eos> I don't care if it's real <eos> 'Cause I like the way you talk <eos> The way you feel <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> 
Woke up in the same clothes I wore yesterday <eos> My head is pounding now, I lost my phone again <eos> I found a grey hair and I thought about <eos> When my dad was my age, he was married by now <eos> Sometimes I wonder how things would turn out <eos> If I stayed in school, never left my hometown <eos> I don't do the things I'm supposed to <eos> Overthinking, underfocused <eos> Emotional rollercoaster, keep it all on my shoulders <eos> Hoping no one will notice <eos> I'm no good at getting older <eos> Last year I almost threw in the towel <eos> I was tired of suits telling me what to write about <eos> Yeah, but then I remembered the girl from Rhode Island <eos> Who said that our music saved her life <eos> And I'm not a saint, but I still talk to Jesus <eos> I hope he knows that I really mean it <eos> I don't do the things I'm supposed to <eos> Overthinking, underfocused <eos> Emotional rollercoaster, keep it all on my shoulders <eos> Hoping no one will notice <eos> I'm no good at getting older <eos> I called my dad one night when I was a wreck <eos> He said at your age, I was a mess <eos> So don't let it all weigh down on your shoulders <eos> Things will work out the way they're supposed to <eos> It's just part of getting older <eos> 
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit <eos> Been saying "yes" instead of "no" <eos> I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though <eos> I hit the ground running each night <eos> I hit the Sunday matinée <eos> You know the greatest films of all time were never made <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And if you wanted me, you really should've showed <eos> And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow <eos> And it's alright now <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> I have this dream you're doing cool shit <eos> Having adventures on your own <eos> You meet some woman on the internet and take her home <eos> We never painted by the numbers, baby <eos> But we were making it count <eos> You know the greatest loves of all time are over now <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And it's another day waking up alone <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you <eos> If one thing had been different <eos> Would everything be different today? <eos> We were something, don't you think so? <eos> Rosé flowing with your chosen family <eos> And it would've been sweet <eos> If it could've been me <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For digging up the grave another time <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> 
Hey, if we can solve any problem <eos> Then why do we lose so many tears? <eos> Oh, so you go again <eos> When the leading man appears <eos> Always the same thing <eos> Why can't you see <eos> We've got everything <eos> Going on and on and on? <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you, ooh <eos> Go on and go free <eos> Maybe you're too close to see <eos> I can feel your body move <eos> Doesn't mean that much to me <eos> I can't go on <eos> Saying the same thing <eos> Why can't you see <eos> That we've got everything? <eos> Do you even know, you know, know? <eos> Every time you go away, yeah <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you, ooh <eos> Every time you go, ooh <eos> Every time you go <eos> I can't go on <eos> Saying the same things <eos> Baby, can't you see? <eos> We've got everything <eos> Going on and on and on <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> I'm just looking at the pieces <eos> Every time you go away, be careful <eos> 'Cause you take a piece of me with you, yeah <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> Every time you go <eos> 
Darling <eos> Where you goin' to <eos> When all your fears have come? <eos> 'Cause I know your <eos> Head is heavy now but <eos> You were never alone, oh-oh <eos> So come rest and <eos> Find yourself at home and <eos> Tell me where you've been <eos> And don't worry, you don't have to prove yourself <eos> You belong here, in my arms again <eos> I want you, you know I do <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I want you, you know it's true <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> Baby <eos> What you gonna do when <eos> All my love comes 'round? (Ooh, it comes 'round) <eos> 'Cause I hear your <eos> Heart is calling out and <eos> I've been struck by the sound (By the sound of you) <eos> So come here and <eos> Tell me everything and <eos> Let me look in those eyes (Look in those e-eyes) <eos> Don't worry, you don't have to change a thing <eos> I am your and you are mine <eos> I want you, you know I do <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I want you, you know it's true <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I love your ways <eos> You know I do <eos> I love your ways <eos> You know it's true <eos> I love the way <eos> The way you move <eos> And I love the way <eos> I am with you <eos> I want you, you know I do <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I want you, you know it's true <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I want you, you know I do <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> I want you, you know it's true <eos> And I wanna let you love me <eos> 
All these feet on fire <eos> Heavy are your eyes and the weight on your shoulders <eos> Chasing after time <eos> Something you can't touch but you know when it's over <eos> No control <eos> When you're running blind <eos> All we know <eos> Is what we left behind <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Try to let it go <eos> Step out on the cold, embracing the silence <eos> We were never told <eos> We can sing black songs when we should be flying <eos> No control <eos> When you're running blind <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Oooooh <eos> Cover me with moments <eos> Coloring the motions <eos> Oooooh <eos> Cover me with moments <eos> Coloring the motions <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> 
I'm not gonna make this easy, here comes the goodbye <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Take a bath in all the sorrow and enjoy the sight <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I'm takin' a picture of this in the back of my mind <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I know when I really need to I can close my eyes <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> I remember the way you look at all the gates you've been assigned <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Just let me know when you land, only then I'll be fine <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> This won't be the last time <eos> One day we're both gonna look back, laugh at how much we cried <eos> 'Cause every time we left I thought that it would be the last time <eos> 
I see the sun when it shines and others will not only see <eos> And I've ignored all the times that you might've wanted something to do <eos> I've got my heart on backwards, I spend my only days with you <eos> I've got my dreams standing tall, I wonder if she has a clue <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> I'll see the stars in the morning in the clouds when the sun goes down <eos> She's got me feeling each high, oh, no wonder she sees me frown <eos> I see the sun when it shines and others will not only see <eos> And I've ignored all the times that you might've wanted something to do <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> 
Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed <eos> Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam? <eos> Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess <eos> And that girl who tagged along there with you <eos> I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too <eos> From where I sat she looked to be having fun <eos> Keeping up with you, just like I used to <eos> Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high <eos> Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home <eos> Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk <eos> Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go <eos> You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello <eos> But I happened to see without even tryin' <eos> How she laughed with you, just like I used to <eos> Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine <eos> Did you whisper as you crept in through the door <eos> How you'd never done much like this before? <eos> I was thinking back just the other day <eos> Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze <eos> Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do <eos> But now she's knowing you, just like I used to <eos> 
Hello <eos> There's a place <eos> I've been going <eos> There's a place I've been going <eos> Now I'm clean <eos> It would seem <eos> Let's go somewhere I'll be seen <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> I seen Greg and he was like <eos> "I seen your friends at the birthday party <eos> They were kinda fucked up before it even started <eos> They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show <eos> They didn't know about all the weird stuff <eos> So they just left it" (So they just left it) <eos> I was wasted (I was wasted) <eos> And cold <eos> And minding my business <eos> And I seen the girls and they were all like <eos> "Do you wanna come and get fucked up?" <eos> Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing <eos> "No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid <eos> It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it" <eos> "This ain't going well" <eos> I thought that I was stuck in Hell <eos> In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel <eos> About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well <eos> You pulled away when I went in for the kiss <eos> No, it wasn't a diss <eos> You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss <eos> After four years, don't you think I'm over all this? <eos> "That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room <eos> He's gotta share for a bit" <eos> You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby <eos> To get things that they don't have <eos> Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya? <eos> You know that I could sue ya if we're married <eos> And you fuck up again <eos> Impress myself with stealth and bad health <eos> And my wealth and progressive causes <eos> Then drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha <eos> Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it <eos> Look, the fucking state of it <eos> I came pretty late to it <eos> We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture <eos> All your friends <eos> In one place <eos> Oh, we're a scene <eos> Whatever that means <eos> I depend <eos> On my friends <eos> To stay clean <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> As sad as it seems (Alright) <eos> As sad as it seems (Come on) <eos>

Cold <eos> Cold, as I already know you won't be there <eos> If I had seen that it wasn’t a dream <eos> Could you be here? <eos> Baby, I'm blue, don't tell me the truth <eos> Tell me it’s alright <eos> Taking it slow <eos> Try not to call, try not to care <eos> I'm taking it slow <eos> Try not to fall, try not to care <eos> Don't look back <eos> You've had enough of all my love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We're moving on now <eos> And ain't it sad? <eos> Giving up now, giving up all our love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We’re moving on now, somehow <eos> Deep <eos> Deep underwater, I breathe, let me soak <eos> Choosing the shades of the love that we made <eos> Of the love that we broke <eos> Baby was blue <eos> But I think that we knew it was gonna be alright <eos> Now that you’re near, I feel you still here <eos> Oh, what a shame <eos> Don't look back <eos> You’ve had enough of all my love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We're moving on now <eos> Ain't it sad? <eos> Giving up now, giving up all our love <eos> I guess it’s just too bad <eos> We're moving on now, somehow <eos> Typical that you called, oh hell <eos> Not my fault, and you know too well <eos> Difficult at the best of times <eos> Every morning, a new warning sign <eos> Typical that you called, oh hell (Ain't it sad) <eos> Not my fault, and you know too well (Giving up now, giving up all our love) <eos> Difficult at the best of times (I guess it's just too bad) <eos> Every morning, a new warning sign (We're moving on now, somehow) <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> 
Alright, should I go? <eos> Yeah, go ahead <eos> Was it something I said? <eos> Oh fuck <eos> Guess it's time for sadboy kiss and tell <eos> You ruined my life but I wish you well <eos> I lied about that second part, oh well <eos> Yeah, quit leaving me voicemails about your pain <eos> Shouldn't have to listen to the shit you say <eos> Why'd you even bring it up in the first place? <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you call me back at 3 AM <eos> Just to tell me your defense <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you wanna go and bitch to your friends <eos> Was it something that I said <eos> Lately I fear there's no end in sight <eos> 7-Eleven runs after midnight <eos> I know you're never there but you might <eos> Maybe if I try I could sleep it off <eos> I see you when I sleep, so I don't sleep at all <eos> Slowly all my thoughts start singing my favorite song <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you call me back at 3 AM <eos> Just to tell me your defense <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you wanna go and bitch to your friends <eos> Was it something that I said <eos>

Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> Cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Tip-toeing ‘round in space (out of control, out of control) <eos> Do the dash, do the race <eos> Throw the cash in their face <eos> On the moon but out of phase (out of control, out of control) <eos> City map, locate, Double back rotate <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Command V copy and paste (copy and paste, copy and paste) <eos> Command me, set the pace (set the pace) <eos> Wanna link for your chain ? <eos> Grass on ground, rough terrain <eos> You man lounge, I’m detained <eos> So profound and too mundane <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Ring ring ring on my phone <eos> Hot hot hot on my own, on my own <eos> Eclipse just some fresh to my breath (ey) <eos> Everybody knows I’m a mess (ey) <eos> Pressed for a breath, I confess (ey) <eos> Leave me dead <eos> I step with disruption, sometimes I stride with some pride or corruption <eos> Find myself at a junction, looking both ways man I’ve run out of options <eos> Seeing the figures, I choose to ignore them <eos> If them seems important it’s blown out of proportion <eos> Moving with caution, I’m closer to satellites that are in orbit <eos> Flown overseas I’m in-doors I’m exhausted <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> 
I pulled in to Nazareth <eos> Was feeling 'bout half past dead <eos> I just need some place <eos> Where I can lay my head <eos> "Hey, mister, can you tell me <eos> Where a man might find a bed?" <eos> He just grinned and shook my hand <eos> And "No" was all he said <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> I picked up my bag <eos> I went looking for a place to hide <eos> When I saw Carmen and the Devil <eos> Walking side by side <eos> I said "Hey Carmen, come on <eos> Let's go downtown?" <eos> And she said, "I gotta go <eos> But my friend can stick around" <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say <eos> It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day <eos> "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?" <eos> He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?" <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog <eos> He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog." <eos> I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man." <eos> He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can." <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line <eos> My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time <eos> To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one <eos> Who sent me here with her regards for everyone <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> 
There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos> 
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> It don't matter, anyhow <eos> An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> If you don't know by now <eos> When your rooster crows at the break of dawn <eos> Look out your window and I'll be gone <eos> You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on <eos> Don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> That light I never knowed <eos> An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> I'm on the dark side of the road <eos> Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say <eos> To try and make me change my mind and stay <eos> We never did too much talkin' anyway <eos> So don't think twice, it's all right <eos> I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe <eos> Where I'm bound, I can't tell <eos> But goodbye's too good a word, gal <eos> So I'll just say fare thee well <eos> I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind <eos> You could have done better but I don't mind <eos> You just kinda wasted my precious time <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> Like you never did before <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> I can't hear you any more <eos> I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road <eos> I once loved a woman, a child I'm told <eos> I give her my heart but she wanted my soul <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos> 
"... tanto Pinocchio farà ancora una volta di testa sua, ormai c'è cascato, Gatto e Volpe l'hanno convinto a piantare le sue cinque monete d'oro nel Campo dei Miracoli, l'appuntamento è per mezzanotte, da domani, gli hanno detto che sarà ricco e questa sarà la sua notte dei miracoli..." <eos> Questa è la mia notte dei miracoli <eos> Domani tutto il mondo si stupirà di me <eos> Non dovrò accontentare più nessuno <eos> E imparerò la vita a modo mio <eos> Perché non devo credere ai miracoli <eos> Sto per passare il ponte tra i sogni e la realtà <eos> E di la forse spuntano le ali <eos> A quelli un po' speciali come me <eos> Tutti sanno tutto più di me <eos> Quante differenti verità <eos> Sono solo i guai che si assomigliano <eos> Questa notte scintillante cambia la vita mia <eos> Stringo in pugno finalmente tutto e di più <eos> La chiave del tesoro <eos> E' stupido star sempre male per essere normale <eos> Stanotte no <eos> Questa è la mia notte dei miracoli <eos> Camminerò sul filo tra stelle tutte mie <eos> Sceglierò quali amici avere intorno <eos> Magari un po' diversi come me <eos> E' un diritto la felicità <eos> Ho un biglietto per la libertà <eos> Se non giochi mai non puoi mai vincere <eos> Questa notte è perfetta e cambia la vita mia <eos> La fortuna non aspetta <eos> Quando ti dà appuntamento al buio <eos> A volte sono trappole d'amore e fantasia <eos> Stanotte no… <eos> A volte sono trappole d'amore e fantasia <eos> Stanotte no! <eos> Questa volta no, stanotte è mia <eos> 
I’m staring at a blank page <eos> The words I cannot find <eos> A chapter is unwritten <eos> I see outside the lines <eos> And I won’t get caught if I try to catch <eos> Another shooting star so I can make a wish <eos> Today is when the chapter will begin <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour it on me <eos> The wheels just keep on turning <eos> Like broken carousel <eos> Buying all distractions <eos> Like everybody else <eos> And I won’t get caught if I try to catch <eos> Another shooting star so I can make a wish <eos> Today is when the chapter will begin <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour it on me <eos> The open roads are finding me <eos> A hopeful hide in every sea <eos> As I’m looking to the highway <eos> Got some blue skies in the right place <eos> I run myself and back again <eos> From NYC to Disneyland <eos> Letting go of all the memories <eos> Giving fate a chance to catch me <eos> To catch me, to catch me <eos> Oooooh, ooh <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Oooh <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Oooh, yeah <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing <eos> You’re like Parker Posey in a magazine <eos> With fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three <eos> I wanna be your dressed in black <eos> Your dark star with the backwards hat <eos> I’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page <eos> Every page <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> I was a desert, honey you were the sand <eos> I was a bird, baby you were the branch <eos> And I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die <eos> It wasn't much, just everything <eos> You could've sat right there and got high with me <eos> But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares <eos> Brought the nightmares <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> 
Wait and see <eos> If the stones on my feet <eos> Turn to rubble <eos> On the open sea <eos> Float or sink <eos> I am rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> And the man in the cave is quiet <eos> Smiling to himself <eos> God, I wish I was quiet <eos> But my head is full of bells <eos> Something's always ringing <eos> My suitcase always smells <eos> Pour me a drink and then leave it <eos> On the edge of a wishing well <eos> On the edge of a wishing well <eos> Oh, can I bounce back <eos> Oh, or just lay ﬂat? <eos> Cathedral songs <eos> All night long <eos> Soaked in thunder <eos> I'm the stretchy man <eos> So jacked and tan <eos> Made of rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> And she's in a ballroom dancing <eos> And I'm singing through a hole in the wall <eos> I wanna build you a mansion <eos> Just trying to pay some dues is all <eos> And she's like Agatha Christie <eos> And I'm more like Voltaire <eos> Everything is a theory <eos> Carried away with the morning air <eos> Carried away with the morning air <eos> Oh, can I bounce back <eos> Oh, or just lay ﬂat? <eos> Only rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> 
Say it's here where our pieces fall in place <eos> Any rain softly kisses us on the face <eos> Any wind means we're running <eos> We can sleep and see 'em coming <eos> Where we drift and call it dreaming <eos> We can weep and call it singing <eos> Where we break when our hearts are strong enough <eos> We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood <eos> Where we see enough to follow <eos> We can hear when we are hollow <eos> Where we keep the light we're given <eos> We can lose and call it living <eos> Where the sun isn't only sinking fast <eos> Every night knows how long it's supposed to last <eos> Where the time of our lives is all we have <eos> And we get a chance to say, before we ease away <eos> For all the love you've left behind <eos> You can have mine <eos> Say it's here where our pieces fall in place <eos> We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray <eos> Where our water isn't hidden <eos> We can burn and be forgiven <eos> Where our hands hurt from healing <eos> We can laugh without a reason <eos> 'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast <eos> Every moon and our bodies make shining glass <eos> Where the time of our lives is all we have <eos> And we get a chance to say, before we ease away <eos> For all the love you've left behind <eos> You can have mine <eos> 
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in <eos> Or the light coming off of your skin <eos> The fragile heart you protected for so long <eos> Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong <eos> It's not your hands searching slow in the dark <eos> Or your nails leaving love's watermark <eos> It's not the way you talk me off the roof <eos> Your questions like directions to the truth <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> If we were vampires and death was a joke <eos> We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke <eos> Laugh at all the lovers and their plans <eos> I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand <eos> Maybe time running out is a gift <eos> I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift <eos> And give you every second I can find <eos> And hope it isn't me who's left behind <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> 
If you wake up someday soon <eos> In a great big house, in a new bedroom <eos> If you get to thinkin' 'bout the passing of time <eos> Circumstances, years are strange <eos> The same old people have new last names <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still loving you the best that I can <eos> If some weekend evening, your kind new man <eos> At a black tie party, he takes your hand <eos> If you make your entrance in that dress that I liked <eos> If sometime later, you should meet <eos> Some quiet stranger who talks like me <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> 
I hear a lot about sinners <eos> Don't think that I’ll be a saint <eos> But I might go down to the river <eos> 'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch <eos> Yeah, it's making me say <eos> That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy <eos> On God <eos> Runnin’ to the altar like a track star <eos> Can't wait another second <eos> 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy <eos> I don't do well with the drama <eos> And, no, I can't stand it being fake <eos> (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no) <eos> I don't believe in nirvana <eos> But the way that we love in the night gave mе life <eos> Baby, I can't explain <eos> That the way you hold mе, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Yes, oh God) <eos> On God <eos> Runnin' to the altar like a track star <eos> Can’t wait another second <eos> ’Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy <eos> They say we're too young and <eos> The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'" <eos> Wise men say fools rush in <eos> But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> They say we're too young and <eos> The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'" <eos> Wise men say fools rush in <eos> But I don't know <eos> The first step pleases the Father <eos> Might be the hardest to take <eos> But when you come out of the water <eos> I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy <eos> Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci <eos> They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy <eos> But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi <eos> Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed <eos> When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi <eos> Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski <eos> I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week <eos> I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child <eos> I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud <eos> If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds <eos> I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud <eos> Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up <eos> Formalize the union in communion, He can trust <eos> I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us <eos> I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us <eos> 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> (Feels so) Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Feels so) <eos> 
I wonder if I'm being real <eos> Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel? <eos> I wonder, wouldn't it be nice <eos> To live inside a world that isn't black and white? <eos> I wonder what it's like to be my friends <eos> Hope that they don't think I forget about them <eos> I wonder, I wonder <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by <eos> I wonder why I'm so afraid <eos> Of saying something wrong and nevеr said I was a saint <eos> I wonder, when I cry into my hands <eos> I'm conditioned to feel likе it makes me less of a man <eos> And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side <eos> And tell me that the world will end up alright <eos> I wonder, I wonder <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos> 
Still tryna lose the thought of your face <eos> But I think about you all the time <eos> I know we said we'd give each other space <eos> Just need to know you're alright <eos> Heard from your mom, you got some new tattoos <eos> Moved out of state <eos> Don't mean no pressure, just need to make sure <eos> That you're okay <eos> Although feelings faded <eos> We're not strangers <eos> Just because we're not friends doesn't mean I don't care <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> Don't know how to just stop, used to love you too much <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> 'Cause I've been losing sleep <eos> Wondering if you'rе good, so please <eos> Just pick your phone up, lеt me know and I'll stop <eos> Are you alright? Just say you're all alright <eos> Think I needed space, some time alone <eos> Really just to get my head straight <eos> So I saw the world 'til I went broke <eos> And tried to not look at my phone <eos> Heard from my mom, you called her and dad to ask <eos> How I've been <eos> But I'm still not ready, too hurt and angry <eos> To let you in <eos> Although feelings faded <eos> We're not strangers <eos> Just because we're not friends doesn't mean I don't care <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> Don't know how to just stop, used to love you too much <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> 'Cause I've been losing sleep <eos> Wondering if you're good, so please <eos> Just pick your phone up, let me know and I'll stop <eos> Are you alright?

Oh dear, oh dear, I’m sorry <eos> That you grew up so soon <eos> A cold year and no high school parties <eos> I’ve been drinking alone <eos> Oh, I’ve been drinking alone <eos> So, don't fear, don’t fear their warnings <eos> They’re bitterer than most <eos> 4 years of driving across the country <eos> For empty seats at their shows <eos> And they’ve been drinking alone <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos> So when you’re mad for no reason <eos> At everything at once <eos> And when you start overthinking <eos> I’ll be drinking at home <eos> Oh, I’ll be drinking at home <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos> And if you want, I could tell the truth <eos> That this life takes a toll on you <eos> I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> And if you want, I could tell the truth <eos> That this life takes a toll on you <eos> I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos> 
Walking down 29th and park <eos> I saw you in another's arm <eos> Only a month we've been apart <eos> You look happier <eos> Saw you walk inside a bar <eos> He said something to make you laugh <eos> I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours <eos> Yeah, you look happier, you do <eos> Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody love you like I do <eos> Promise that I will not take it personal, baby <eos> If you're moving on with someone new <eos> 'Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <eos> And until then I'll smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sat in the corner of the room <eos> Everything's reminding me of you <eos> Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself <eos> You're happier, aren't you? <eos> Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody need you like I do <eos> I know that there's others that deserve you <eos> But my darling, I am still in love with you <eos> But I guess you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too <eos> I could try to smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> ‘Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> I knew one day you’d fall for someone new <eos> But if he breaks your heart like lovers do <eos> Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you <eos> 
August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
A dangerous plan, just this time <eos> A stranger's hand clutched in mine <eos> I'll take this chance, so call me blind <eos> I've been waiting all my life <eos> Please don't scar this young heart <eos> Just take my hand <eos> I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> Hold me close through the night <eos> Don't let me go, we'll be alright <eos> Touch my soul and hold it tight <eos> I've been waiting all my life <eos> I won't scar your young heart <eos> Just take my hand <eos> 'Cause I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> Please don't go, I've been waiting so long <eos> Oh, you don't even know me at all <eos> But I was made for loving you <eos> I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> 
Lay your love on mine <eos> Lay your love on mine <eos> Let your safety fall <eos> Let your safety fall <eos> Lay your pride on the line <eos> Lay your pride on the line <eos> No one's keeping score <eos> No one's keeping you away from me <eos> Only fear and doubt can be the downfall <eos> It's our enemy <eos> Who are you trying to blame? <eos> It's no one's fault <eos> Cause inside of me <eos> I love you to the core <eos> If you leap inside the corners of my mind <eos> Somersault into my emotions <eos> I'm a river till you take the dive <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Keep your lips on mine <eos> Keep your lips on mine <eos> Steady to the shore <eos> Steady to the shore <eos> Crash into the lies <eos> Crash into the lies <eos> The truth will keep us warm <eos> The truth will keep you away from me <eos> Only fear and doubt can be the downfall <eos> It's our enemy <eos> Who are you trying to blame? <eos> It's no one's fault <eos> Cause inside of me <eos> I love you to the core <eos> If you leap inside the corners of my mind <eos> Somersault into my emotions <eos> I'm a river till you take the dive <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos>

You must've come from out of the blue <eos> No other color would do <eos> We watched the clouds move all around <eos> Uncovering feelings unfound <eos> And I can't imagine when <eos> I can't imagine why I'd ever wanna leave you, dear <eos> If we stay right here <eos> We wouldn't have to worry about anything <eos> But the morning came and stole you right <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Your eyes are full of yellows and greens <eos> They turn into water and fall from your cheeks <eos> Now we're going deep into the dark <eos> And it's hard to tell where we are <eos> And I can't imagine when <eos> I can't imagine why I’d ever wanna leave you, dear <eos> If we stay right here <eos> We wouldn't have to worry about anything <eos> But the morning fades and so do you <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Ooh, what a lovely day for loving you <eos> Ooh, what a lovely day for loving you <eos> Love, oh <eos> The sunset, it bled orange and red <eos> In a perfect explosion behind your head <eos> While we're looking up, somehow we forget <eos> That even the best days will end <eos> Now I can't remember when <eos> I can't remember why you packed your bags and left me here <eos> It's been a whole year <eos> Since we said we'd never find somebody new <eos> Now I hardly ever talk to you <eos> But today, I stopped and thought of you <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out, out of the blue <eos> 
Don't ask me <eos> What you know is true <eos> Don't have to tell you <eos> I love your precious heart <eos> Oh, I, I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never tear us apart <eos> We could live, yeah <eos> For a thousand years <eos> But if I hurt you <eos> I'd make wine from your tears <eos> I told you <eos> We could fly <eos> 'Cause we all have wings <eos> But some of us don't know why <eos> I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, ever tear us apart, ooh <eos> I, I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> And two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, ever <eos> I, I was standing <eos> And you were there, yeah <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, oh, ever, ever <eos> I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> And two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, they could never, they could never, never <eos>

I've been holding my breath <eos> I've been counting to 10 <eos> Over something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm alone in my bed <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on (Oh, I) <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that gives you <eos> All of the things I could not know <eos> 'Cause I keep fighting all the way <eos> I let you down so I could stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go <eos> And, baby, I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
One day you're here <eos> And the next, you're gone <eos> And it's killing me to say this <eos> Will we stay or will we go? <eos> I'm sick of all this <eos> Back and forth and on and on <eos> Feels like I'm the only one who cares <eos> Sick of wasting time with you <eos> But I know I can't be through <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos> Can we go back to the start <eos> When I kiss your neck <eos> And you hold me in your arms <eos> Lets just forget all the ways this could go wrong <eos> Lets get to loving baby <eos> Won't you love me baby? <eos> I'm sick of all this <eos> Back and forth and on and on <eos> Feels like I'm the only one who cares <eos> Sick of wasting time with you <eos> But I know I can't be through <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Ooh I don't wanna walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Ooh and I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos>

When we're all alone and the night has falled <eos> And lost in what each other needs <eos> When the silence echoes our nervous hearts <eos> And all is just the way we feel <eos> I can't hide it, shouldn't fight <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And loose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> You  shy away, you was afraid <eos> To give into something so real <eos> Allow desire to rule your head <eos> Get lost in what we feel <eos> You can't hide it shouldn't fight it <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And lose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
They didn't ever say where we were going <eos> We just climbed into the backseat <eos> Eyes wide open to the picture show outside <eos> I guess we really didn't understand it all <eos> I remember looking up at them in the front row <eos> Hands touched together almost out of sight <eos> It's been a long hard week but now the slow release <eos> Of a Sunday afternoon <eos> And we were only young but they were trying hard to reach us <eos> How was I to know that there was something so worth keepin'? <eos> 'Cause we were watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> Man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> The sun warms your soul just like an old friend <eos> Singing songs along that ribbon of a road <eos> And everyone you love is sitting there so close <eos> You're never thinking that you'd ever get old <eos> No, you'll never get old <eos> Just watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> And man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive, oh <eos> I never said where we were going <eos> I just helped them to the backseat <eos> Dad just laughed and said, "Son, don't drive too far <eos> Your mama gets pretty tired these days" <eos> After a few miles I guess they recognized some places <eos> And I listened as they reminisced <eos> About a world that they had always known and how it's changin' <eos> Probably never gonna be the same again <eos> I caught 'em in the mirror <eos> They were holding hands and smiling <eos> Looking younger than they'd been in years <eos> Oh, through all the years <eos> And they were watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> Man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> 
I guess a break is just a break until it's broken <eos> You're noticing that it's been so long <eos> I guess I'm learnin' for certain it wasn't worth it <eos> Deservin' this, yeah, it feels so wrong <eos> You took a shot at me, I took it pretty hard <eos> Sweepin' up a shattered broken heart <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> I guess I should've known better that I'd be better off <eos> But something had me holdin' on <eos> I guess this hanging and dangling left me strangling <eos> And trust me, that ain't somethin' you want <eos> Sometimes subliminal meanings can mean the literal <eos> You left me critical <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> You took a shot at me, I took it pretty hard <eos> Sweepin' up a shattered broken heart <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' that your heart can take a hell of a beating <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos>

I took my love, took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain, and I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart rise above? <eos> Can I sail through the changing ocean tides? <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Yeah I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Yeah I'm getting older too <eos> I take my love, take it down <eos> Oh, climb a mountain and turn around <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> Oh, the landslide will bring it down <eos>

You give me a sign <eos> You give me a lift <eos> You take me home when I've done my shift <eos> You give me a loan <eos> When I'm stone cold broke <eos> Get me high, when I need a toke <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Times were tough <eos> We made it through <eos> We tasted the rough <eos> So let's save the spoon <eos> All the time I was hurtin' you <eos> Got to believe that I was hurtin' too <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Your the only one I can talk to <eos> The only one I can really read <eos> I know you give because you want to <eos> Don't you think it's time you learned to let yourself receive? <eos> Can make you smile <eos> Can make you sing <eos> Just wanna give back a lil bit of what you give me <eos> I could sing you a song <eos> Play you a tune <eos> I know its just a little thing but it's something I can do <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was a-born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> 
The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken <eos> I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold <eos> In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot <eos> I willed the car to start to bring me home to you <eos> Oh, lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview <eos> To wish back an image of myself I thought was true <eos> So now when colors fade and on that day of days <eos> I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue <eos> Oh, and lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes <eos> Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit <eos> And I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken <eos> Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big <eos> But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met <eos> You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago <eos> There was something about you I struggled to forget <eos> My blood was rushing down to you <eos> You were leadin’ me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse <eos> 'Cause you're a wanderer too <eos> 
One spring mornin' <eos> Six years ago <eos> Felt the shadows <eos> Strangle hold <eos> In the hallway <eos> Hung up the phone <eos> I heard my mother <eos> Please come home <eos> Within my horror <eos> My spirit cold <eos> 'neath the violence <eos> The final blows <eos> Gathering comfort <eos> I do recall <eos> From the darkness <eos> Callin' forth <eos> I called for ya <eos> Chokin' on the white noise rushin' <eos> Howlin' from <eos> The great beyond <eos> I called for ya <eos> I recall the violence rainin' down <eos> I was shiverin' <eos> Stone cold <eos> With the sickenin' <eos> Waves of woe <eos> And the memories <eos> Hauntin' on <eos> I lost the key to all <eos> That ever was <eos> The sunlight struck me <eos> So cynical <eos> Seemed unjust <eos> Void of hope <eos> But there you were <eos> Your wings around me <eos> Found my heart lost <eos> And gave it warmth <eos> I called for ya <eos> Chokin' on the white noise rushin' <eos> Howlin' from <eos> The great beyond <eos> I called for ya <eos> I recall the violence rainin' down <eos> All around <eos> Cherry <eos> Blossom wild and free <eos> Can you still remember <eos> Sister to me <eos> Cherry <eos> Our wild cherry tree <eos> I still remember you and me <eos> Cherry <eos> Blossom wild and free <eos> Forever remember <eos> Sister to me <eos> Cherry <eos> Wild river to the sea <eos> I still remember you and me <eos> 
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside <eos> I'm not one of those who can easily hide <eos> I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did <eos> I'd buy a big house where we both could live <eos> If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no <eos> Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show <eos> I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do <eos> My gift is my song, and this one's for you <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss <eos> Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross <eos> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song <eos> It's for people like you that keep it turned on <eos> So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do <eos> You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue <eos> Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean <eos> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos> 
I know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain <eos> Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow <eos> Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can <eos> You see, I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah, ooh <eos> That's why I'm easy <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning <eos> That's why I'm easy <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning <eos> Why in the world would anybody put chains on me, yeah? <eos> I've paid my dues to make it <eos> Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be <eos> I'm not happy when I try to fake it, no, ooh <eos> That's why I'm easy, yeah <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning <eos> That's why I'm easy <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning <eos> I wanna be high, so high <eos> I wanna be free to know the things I do are right <eos> I wanna be free <eos> Just me, oh babe <eos> Ooh <eos> That's why I'm easy <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah <eos> That's why I'm easy <eos> I'm easy like Sunday morning, woah <eos> 'Cause I'm easy, whoo <eos> Easy like Sunday morning, yeah <eos> 'Cause I'm easy <eos> Easy like Sunday morning, woah <eos> 'Cause I'm easy <eos> 
And, darling <eos> Is there a cure for this hunger? <eos> A terrible curse to be under <eos> I'll be sleeping with that <eos> And it's no small thing <eos> You'll smoke me out in your own ways <eos> And chase me around until morning <eos> And follow me back <eos> And, lovely <eos> You're tearing me down with your cheekbones <eos> They're warm, but they hit me like sharp stones <eos> When you pull away <eos> Now I walk slow <eos> And wander the streets in the morning <eos> I still smell your scent like a warning <eos> When the wind blows <eos> Oh, when the wind blows <eos> So, leave me <eos> When you're sleeping alone in the basement <eos> And my parents are home, but I'm vacant <eos> And I'm watching the news <eos> Because I'm slow now <eos> I'm young, but I feel like an old man <eos> The tar in my lungs and these cold hands <eos> They held onto you <eos> No, keep me <eos> Inside of your mind when you're aching <eos> Lord, 'cause for now, we're mistaken <eos> In thinking we fit <eos> But I'll stay steady, but nights are a-blazing and heavy <eos> Alone in my room and I'm ready <eos> To rest for a while <eos> Oh, to rest for a while <eos> Oh, but I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind, honey, I don't mind <eos> Oh, but I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> And I don't mind it <eos> I'll wait and I'll listen <eos> I don't mind it <eos> And see through to the kitchen <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I'm not taking it back <eos> Oh, and I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it, I <eos> Oh, honey, I don't mind <eos> 
Yes, I know what it means <eos> To have six years behind us in waiting <eos> Not but a shadow remains <eos> Well, you took what was left worth taking <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow, too <eos> I have to get out of this place <eos> But instead I'm at peace with staying <eos> Oh, we both come and go as we please <eos> Well, I guess that’s the game that we're playing <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow, too <eos> I came to my senses alone <eos> In the bed where my eyes was lying <eos> It was there that my thoughts turned to you <eos> Waylaid by the light that was dying <eos> And was backed by the wails of a siren <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow too <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos>

What am I waking for? <eos> Am I waiting for a sign <eos> That I'm brave enough to follow? <eos> Can I just fail enough to bail out? <eos> I'm in my Wednesday suit <eos> I'm just so sick of this commute <eos> Are they always speakin' to me? <eos> Only advertisers know me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> I'm in Belvеdere <eos> You said the air was crystal clеar <eos> I get attached to my surroundings <eos> Like they know everythin' about me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Or maybe I'm just falling apart <eos> How'd we get so far? <eos> Tryna make a better escape <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> 
Will you fall, fall, fall for your furies? <eos> Would you die on the blade like your daddy did? <eos> And will you not stop and shake from this worry? <eos> Would you stay on the line while your country dies? <eos> The world burns by <eos> You've got smoke in your eyes <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Yes, now go, now, all who can leave us <eos> Give what you can, oh, but take what you need <eos> And will this dark world soon become clearer? <eos> Or are we bound to stay quiet and drift off into sleep? <eos> Dreams of money and greed <eos> Such a dark destiny <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Oh, I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Will you fall, fall, fall for your furies? <eos> There's only so much that a spirit can take <eos> Will you not stop and shake from this worry? <eos> You'd be surprised what your own hands can make <eos> Within the garden gates <eos> Love emanates <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Yeah, I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> 
I met a girl last night, she was only 23 <eos> I brought her home to mine she gave herself away to me <eos> But the light in the hallway and the silence in my room <eos> Said I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> And you were wearing that red dress when you took him upstairs <eos> The one I bought you in New York before you made this mess <eos> You've run with another, you've cut me through and through <eos> And still I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> A riverside hotel tonight <eos> With walls that catch the city lights <eos> Just tell me you want me I don't care if it's true <eos> 'Cause I don’t think I'll get used to losing you <eos> Tell me where did you learn to lie so well <eos> To love like a secret you'd never tell <eos> You've stripped me of everything and I hate you, I really do <eos> Still I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> 
I'm putting down the habit <eos> That habit of looking back on all of it and wishing I had done better <eos> Oh I just wanna feel it <eos> Feel that I like who I’m becoming and feel alright in the quiet <eos> I know the sun don't rise and set above me <eos> I don't want you to compromise a lot to love me <eos> But if you call <eos> I’ll turn on the light for you <eos> If you call <eos> I'm gonna be bright for you <eos> If you call <eos> I've been a little darker <eos> Than I've been wanting you to see though you've been coming ‘round needing to be looked after <eos> Well I don't have an answer <eos> Why I've been buried underneath some kind of mountain that I made <eos> Oh some disaster <eos> I know the sun don't rise and set above me <eos> I don’t want you to compromise a lot to love me <eos> But if you call <eos> I’ll turn on the light for you <eos> If you call <eos> I'm gonna be bright for you <eos> If you call <eos> I’ll tell you something that I've learned <eos> As we've been watching people leaving <eos> All the loving that we've earned <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> All the loving that we’ve earned <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> It's gonna keep us breathing <eos> It's gonna keep us breathing <eos> Keep us breathing <eos> 
You could open with your failings <eos> Make them understand, show the love notes <eos> Make them picture with their eyes closed <eos> Make them wonder where the time goes <eos> Keep your distance south of river <eos> Draw a line, they are not together <eos> Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red <eos> Make me wonder where the time went <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> Be not a stranger land here <eos> I will leave this empty-handed <eos> Feeling selfish, common as shit <eos> Leave me question where your heart lends <eos> How you open-wounded withstand <eos> Lead me into some false pretence <eos> I will ruin you in a second <eos> Leave it up to interpretation <eos> Open-ended invitation <eos> And your wedding, I could crash it <eos> Whisper in your ear “God, I missed you <eos> It's been too much, I can’t stand it” <eos> Then I cried there in the staff room <eos> Selling my seats to your concert <eos> I won't stomach it if I see you <eos> Walking so tall, I can't reach you <eos> Happier, pretty picture <eos> With some new pretty little blue <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> 
When you walk through a storm <eos> Hold your head up high <eos> And don't be afraid of the dark <eos> At the end of the storm <eos> There's a golden sky <eos> And the sweet silver song of the lark <eos> Walk on through the wind <eos> Walk on through the rain <eos> Though your dreams be tossed and blown <eos> Walk on, walk on <eos> With hope in your heart <eos> And you'll never walk alone <eos> You'll never walk alone <eos> When you walk through a storm <eos> Hold your head up high <eos> And don't be afraid of the dark <eos> At the end of the storm <eos> There's a golden sky <eos> And the sweet silver song of the lark <eos> Walk on through the wind <eos> Walk on through the rain <eos> Though your dreams bе tossed and blown <eos> Walk on, walk on <eos> With hope in your heart <eos> And you'll nеver walk alone <eos> 
Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour <eos> Souris à nos ivresses <eos> Nuit plus douce que le jour <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Le temps fuit et sans retour <eos> Emporte nos tendresses <eos> Loin de cet heureux séjour <eos> Le temps fuit sans retour <eos> Zéphyrs embrasés <eos> Versez-nous vos caresses <eos> Zéphyrs embrasés <eos> Donnez-nous vos baisers! <eos> Vos baisers! vos baisers! Ah! <eos> Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour <eos> Souris à nos ivresses <eos> Nuit plus douce que le jour <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Ah! Souris à nos ivresses! <eos> Nuit d'amour, ô nuit d'amour! <eos> Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! <eos> 
Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Gave thee life & bid thee feed <eos> By the stream & o'er the mead; <eos> Gave thee clothing of delight <eos> Softest clothing wooly bright; <eos> Gave thee such a tender voice <eos> Making all the vales rejoice! <eos> Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee! <eos> He is called by thy name <eos> For he calls himself a Lamb: <eos> He is meek & he is mild <eos> He became a little child: <eos> I a child & thou a lamb <eos> We are called by his name <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> 

When the cold of winter comes <eos> Starless night will cover day <eos> In the veiling of the sun <eos> We will walk in bitter rain <eos> But in dreams (But in dreams) <eos> I can hear your name <eos> And in dreams (And in dreams) <eos> We will meet again <eos> When the seas and mountains fall <eos> And we come, to end of days <eos> In the dark I hear a call <eos> Calling me there <eos> I will go there <eos> And back again <eos> 
When a humble bard graced a ride along <eos> With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song <eos> From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil <eos> His army of elves at his hooves did they revel <eos> They came after me with masterful deceit <eos> Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth <eos> While the Devil's horns minced our tender meat <eos> And so cried the Witcher, "He can't be bleat" <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty <eos> At the edge of the world, fight the mighty horn <eos> That bashes and breaks you and brings you to mourn <eos> He thrust every elf far back on the shelf <eos> High up on the mountain from whence it came <eos> He wiped out your pest, got kicked in his chest <eos> He's a friend of humanity, so give him the rest <eos> That's my epic tale: our champion prevailed <eos> Defeated the villain, now pour him some ale <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, a-oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> 
I've been taking my time for a long time <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> Speaking English as a foreign language <eos> Any words that I haven't forgot <eos> I've been thinking how I can't be bothered <eos> To wash the dishes or remake the bed <eos> What's the point when I could doss instead? <eos> I've been hanging out with various riff-raff <eos> Somewhere on the Goldhawk road <eos> I don't think it's gonna be much longer <eos> 'Til I'm mugging up on the penal code <eos> Love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> Like all their aspirations, it's a fantasy <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> You made me see reality <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> It's a blatant fallacy <eos> You won't see me with a bunch of roses <eos> Promising fidelity <eos> Love doesn't mean a thing to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> While the bankers all get their bonuses <eos> I'll just get along with what I've got <eos> Watching the weeds in the garden <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> I'll explore the outer limits of boredom <eos> Moaning periodically <eos> Just a full-time lonely layabout, that's me <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> It's absolutely clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> Just like they said at university <eos> I'll be taking my time for a long time <eos> With all the schadenfreude it's cost <eos> Calculating what you've lost <eos> Now I'm digging through my student paperbacks <eos> Flicking through Karl Marx again <eos> Searching for the soul of England <eos> Drinking tea like Tony Benn <eos> Love is just a bourgeois construct <eos> So I'm giving up the bourgeoisie <eos> Until you come back to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> 
If I should die this very moment <eos> I wouldn't fear <eos> For I've never known completeness <eos> Like being here <eos> Wrapped in the warmth of you <eos> Loving every breath of you <eos> Still my heart this moment <eos> Or it might burst <eos> Could we stay right here <eos> Until the end of time until the earth stops turning <eos> Wanna love you until the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> All this time I've loved you <eos> And never known your face <eos> All this time I've missed you <eos> And searched this human race <eos> Here is true peace <eos> Here my heart knows calm <eos> Safe in your soul <eos> Bathed in your sighs <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> All I've known, all I've done, all I've felt <eos> Was leading to this <eos> All I've known, all I've done, all I've felt <eos> Was leading to this <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one <eos> I've waited for <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one <eos> I've waited for <eos> Ooh, oh <eos>

I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance <eos> I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands <eos> I've seen neon rebounds <eos> And late-night drunk dials <eos> I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke <eos> I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke <eos> The real thing won't be easy <eos> Yeah, might take a while <eos> But I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs <eos> And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there <eos> They had their share of ups and downs <eos> And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it <eos> To get to that that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I've had some real close calls <eos> A couple diamond ring thoughts <eos> And enough midnight tears to know what love's not <eos> I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Somebody like that <eos> Mmm, somebody like that <eos> Love somebody like that <eos>

How can someone stand so damn close <eos> And feel like they're worlds away? <eos> I can see your sad story eyes <eos> So how do you have no words to say? <eos> All I want is to fall in deeper <eos> Than I've ever been <eos> Why won't you let me? <eos> I can handle your heart, so help me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright <eos> Through the dark for the both of us <eos> And "I've done it outta love" is not enough <eos> But God, how I wish it was <eos> And I don't wanna find out <eos> How much lonely I can take before you lose me <eos> Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> I can't let it go <eos> From moments in your arms <eos> But they come back again <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> 
I wanna steal every breath of fire <eos> From every star in the Southern sky <eos> I wanna lay down in the dark <eos> And take a match right to your heart <eos> I wanna hide with you in the rain <eos> In the eye of a hurricane <eos> I wanna call it for what it is <eos> And give you everything I've got to give <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Keep me locked up in your eyes <eos> Before the sun pushes out the night <eos> Before we're whispers in the air <eos> Come on and take me without a care <eos> I wanna know what it feels like <eos> To disappear into you and <eos> Never have to say goodbye <eos> I wanna call love what it is <eos> And give you everything I've got to give <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Don't wanna go yet, Romeo + Juliet <eos> Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset <eos> Ooh baby, drivin' me crazy <eos> Windows up, prayin' God don't save me <eos> Don't wanna go yet, Romeo + Juliet <eos> Sunrise feelin' like a final sunset <eos> Ooh baby drivin' me crazy <eos> Windows up, prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Me and you in the backseat <eos> Drivin' me crazy <eos> Killin' me baby <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> With the windows up <eos> Spendin' all my love <eos> Prayin' God don't save me <eos> Till there's nothing left <eos> 
You may think that I'm talking foolish <eos> You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free <eos> You may wonder how I can promise you now <eos> This love that I feel for you, always will be <eos> But you're not just time that I'm killing <eos> I'm no longer one of those guys <eos> As sure as I live, this love that I give <eos> Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen​ <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> I'll be happy to tell you again <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> They say that time takes its toll on a body <eos> Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey <eos> But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair <eos> And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway <eos> They say that time can play tricks on a memory <eos> Make people forget things they knew <eos> Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me <eos> I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> Well, just listen to how this song ends <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> 
Down on the corner by the traffic light <eos> Everybody's looking as she walks by <eos> They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> Up by the bus stop and across the street <eos> Open up their windows to take a peek <eos> Y'all she goes walking, rockin' like a rollin' stone <eos> Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> She can't help it if she's made that way <eos> She's not to blame if they look her way <eos> She ain't really trying to cause a scene <eos> It just comes naturally, ah Lord the girl can't help it <eos> Well up on Main Street by the taxi stand <eos> There's a crowd of people and a traffic jam <eos> But she don't look back, she ain't doing nothing wrong <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> She can't help it if she's made that way <eos> She's not to blame if they look her way <eos> She ain't really trying to cause a scene <eos> It just comes naturally, awww the girl can't help it <eos> Down on the corner by the traffic light <eos> Everybody's looking as she walks by <eos> They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> 
(Verse 1:  David Frizzell) <eos> There's a full moon over Tulsa <eos> I hope that it's shining on you <eos> The nights are getting cold <eos> In Cherokee County <eos> There's a Blue Norther passing through <eos> I remember green eyes and a rancher's daughter <eos> But remember is all that I do <eos> Losing you left a pretty good cowboy <eos> With nothing to hold on to <eos> Sundown came and I drove to town <eos> And drank a drink or two <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 2:  Shelly West) <eos> Here the city lights outshine the moon <eos> I was just now thinking of you <eos> Sometimes when the wind blows you can <eos> See the mountains <eos> And all the way to Malibu <eos> Everyone's a star here in L.A. County <eos> You ought to see the things that they do <eos> All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip <eos> Wish that they could be like you <eos> The Santa Monica Freeway <eos> Sometimes makes a country girl blue <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 3:  Both) <eos> I work 10 hours on a John Deere tractor <eos> Just thinking of you all day <eos> I've got a calico cat and a two-room flat <eos> On a street in West L.A <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos> 
Wrote my whole life down in a notebook <eos> Songs about you and me <eos> I've been singing to every soul in Tennessee <eos> But nobody seems to listen <eos> And no one ever smiles the way that you do <eos> So I guess you'll never hear me on the radio <eos> And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine <eos> To hold you once more <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> I left home for Hollywood looking for a part to play <eos> Well, you always said I had such a pretty face <eos> But I guess I'm not that pretty <eos> 'Cause no one looks at me the way that you do <eos> Well, you'll always be a movie star to me <eos> And darlin', now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> Well, we're stuck here in these hills that they call mountains <eos> But darlin', back home in your arms is right where I want to be <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> 
Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Sometimes it feels like <eos> This world's gone crazy <eos> Grandpa, take me back to yesterday <eos> Where the line between right and wrong <eos> Didn't seem so hazy <eos> Did lovers really fall in love to stay <eos> Stand beside each other come what may? <eos> Was a promise really something people kept <eos> Not just something they would say? <eos> Did families really bow their heads to pray? <eos> Did daddies really never go away? <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Grandpa <eos> Everything is changing fast <eos> We call it progress <eos> But I just don't know <eos> And Grandpa, let's wonder back into the past <eos> And paint me a picture of long ago <eos> Did lovers really fall in love to stay <eos> Stand beside each other come what may? <eos> Was a promise really something people kept <eos> Not just something they would say and then forget? <eos> Did families really bow their heads to pray? <eos> Did daddies really never go away? <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good ole days <eos> 
I don't believe in superstars <eos> Organic food and foreign cars <eos> I don't believe the price of gold <eos> The certainty of growing old <eos> That right is right and left is wrong <eos> That north and south can't get along <eos> That east is east and west is west <eos> And being first is always best <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos> Well I don't believe that heaven waits <eos> For only those who congregate <eos> I like to think of God as love <eos> He's down below, he's up above <eos> He's watchin' people, everywhere <eos> He knows who does and doesn't care <eos> And I'm an ordinary man <eos> Sometimes I wonder who I am <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in music <eos> I believe in magic <eos> And I believe in you <eos> I know with all my certainty <eos> What's going on with you and me <eos> Is a good thing <eos> It's true <eos> I believe in you <eos> I don't believe virginity <eos> Is as common as it used to be <eos> In working days and sleeping nights <eos> That black is black and white is white <eos> That Superman and Robin Hood <eos> Are still alive in Hollywood <eos> That gasoline's in short supply <eos> The rising cost of gettin' by <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in old folks <eos> I believe in children <eos> I believe in you <eos> I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos> 
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart <eos> Without saying a word you can light up the dark <eos> Try as I may I could never explain <eos> What I hear when you don't say a thing <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> All day long I can hear people talking out loud <eos> But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd <eos> Old Mister Webster could never define <eos> What's being said between your heart and mine <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> 
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town <eos> Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all around <eos> And all the girls from there to Austin <eos> Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelry in hock <eos> To take a trip to go and listen to the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Well he couldn't ride or wrangle <eos> And he never cared to make a dime <eos> But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time <eos> And all the girls from nine to ninety <eos> Were snappin' fingers, tappin' toes, and beggin' him "don't stop" <eos> And hypnotized and fascinated by the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him 'round <eos> He vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town <eos> But all the girls still dreamed about him <eos> And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked <eos> And then one day on the Hit Parade was a little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> 
I wanna tell you all the story 'bout <eos> A Harper Valley widowed  wife <eos> Who had a teenage daughter <eos> Who attended Harper Valley Junior High <eos> Well her daughter came home one afternoon <eos> And didn't even stop to play <eos> And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well the note said Mrs. Johnson <eos> You're wearin' your dresses way too high <eos> It's reported you've been drinking <eos> And a-running round with men and goin' wild <eos> And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up <eos> Your little girl this way <eos> And it was signed by the Secretary <eos> Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet <eos> That very afternoon <eos> And they were sure surprised <eos> When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room <eos> And as she walked up to the blackboard <eos> I can still recall the words she had to say <eos> She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there <eos> And seven times he asked me for a date <eos> And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice <eos> Whenever he's away <eos> And Mr. Baker can you tell us why <eos> Your secretary had to leave this town? <eos> And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep <eos> Her window shades all pulled completely down <eos> Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here <eos> 'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again <eos> And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath <eos> You'll find she's had a little nip of gin <eos> And then you have the nerve to tell me <eos> You think that as a mother I'm not fit <eos> Well this is just a little Peyton Place <eos> And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites <eos> No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did <eos> It happened just this way <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos> 
I told Mary about us <eos> I told her about our great sin <eos> Mary cried and forgave me <eos> And Mary took me back again <eos> Said if I wanted my freedom <eos> I could be free evermore <eos> But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see <eos> Mary cry anymore <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Mary is waitin' and weepin' <eos> Down in our shack by the sea <eos> Even after I've hurt her <eos> Mary' still in love with me <eos> Devil woman it's over <eos> Trapped no more by your charms <eos> Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away <eos> Woman let go of my arm <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Devil woman you're evil <eos> Like the dark coral reef <eos> Like the winds that bring high tides <eos> You bring sorrow and grief <eos> You made me ashamed to face Mary <eos> Barely had the strength to tell <eos> Skies are not so black, Mary took me back <eos> Mary has broken your spell <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Runnin' along by the seashore <eos> Runnin' as fast as I can <eos> Even the seagulls are happy <eos> Glad I'm coming home again <eos> Never again will I ever <eos> Cause another tear to fall <eos> Down the beach I see, what belongs to me <eos> The one I want most of all <eos> Oh, devil woman, devil woman <eos> Don't follow me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I'm going back home <eos>

Well, we were down in Austin, Texas <eos> At the Hang 'em High Saloon <eos> Hitting the bars, pickin' on guitars <eos> And singin' out country tunes <eos> When some third-string Longhorn quarterback <eos> Said he wanted a piece of Wade <eos> Well, when it's two for one <eos> It's one for all <eos> So I jumped down off that stage <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm bulletproof <eos> Ten feet tall when I'm drinkin' <eos> Get to thinkin' that I'm Superman <eos> So you stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Yeah, this one time, we were out in L.A. <eos> Shuttin' down the Sunset Strip <eos> We were sippin' on bubbles <eos> Lookin' for some trouble <eos> When a supermodel strutted on in <eos> Yeah, Randy told me, "That girl is famous" <eos> She's way, way over your head <eos> I bet you five hundred <eos> You can't get her number <eos> So I just smiled and said: <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm a Prince Charmin', Casanova <eos> Don Juan, Romeo <eos> A smooth talkin' ladies' man <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Well, good friends and bad decisions <eos> Just go hand in hand <eos> And it's good to know you got somebody <eos> Who's got your back <eos> And got your can <eos> Here, hold this man, you know what I'm talkin' about <eos> Oh, man! <eos> Yeah, well hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> And let us show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> So don't be fakin' <eos> It's okay to be drinkin' <eos> And I'm gonna want it back again <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> No, no, man <eos> You stay here <eos> Yeah, and hold my beer <eos> I got you, little buddy <eos> Good luck with that <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing <eos> The tune about the wild side of life <eos> As I listen to the words you are saying <eos> It brings memories when I was a trusting wife <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> It's a shame that all the blame is on us women <eos> It's not true that only you men feel the same <eos> From the start most every heart that's ever broken <eos> Was because there always was a man to blame <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> 
The cattle are prowlin' <eos> The coyotes are howlin' <eos> Way out where the doggies roam <eos> Where spurs are a jinglin' <eos> And the cowboy is singing <eos> His lonesome cattle call <eos> He rides in the sun <eos> 'Til his days work is done <eos> And he rounds up the cattle each fall <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> For hours he would ride <eos> On the range far and wide <eos> When the night wind blows up and slow <eos> His heart is a feather <eos> In all kinds of weather <eos> He sings his cattle call <eos> He's browned as a fairy <eos> From ridin' the prairie <eos> And he sings with an western drawl <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> 
Everybody's going out and having fun <eos> I'm just a fool for staying home and having none <eos> I can't get over how she set set me free <eos> Oh lonesome me <eos> A bad mistake I'm making by just hanging round <eos> I know that I should have some fun and paint the town <eos> A lovesick fool is blind and just can't see <eos> Oh lonesome me <eos> I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free <eos> Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms <eos> But I still love her so and brother don't you know <eos> I'd welcome her right back here in my arms <eos> Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues <eos> Forget about the past and find somebody new <eos> I've thought of everything from A to Z <eos> Oh lonesome me <eos> Well I'll bet she's not like me she's out and fancy free <eos> Flirtin' with the boys with all her charms <eos> But I still love her so and brother don't you know <eos> I'd welcome her right back here in my arms <eos> Well there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues <eos> Forget about the past and find somebody new <eos> I've thought of everything from A to Z <eos> Oh lonesome me <eos> Oh lonesome me <eos> 
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere <eos> I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep <eos> So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness <eos> 'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak <eos> He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces <eos> And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes <eos> So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces <eos> For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice" <eos> So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow <eos> Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light <eos> And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression <eos> Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy <eos> You gotta learn to play it right" <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin' <eos> Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep <eos> 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser <eos> And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep <eos> And when he finished speakin' <eos> He turned back towards the window <eos> Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep <eos> And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even <eos> But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em) <eos> Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em) <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> 
I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks <eos> Slow movin' trains and rain <eos> I love little country streams, sleep without dreams <eos> Sunday school in May and hay <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends <eos> Birds of the world and squirrels <eos> I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups <eos> Bourbon in a glass and grass <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child <eos> Tomatoes on the vine and onions <eos> I love winners when they cry, losers when they try <eos> Music when it's good and life <eos> And I love you too <eos> 
The only two things in life that make it worth livin' <eos> Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women <eos> I don't need my name in the marquee lights <eos> I got my song and I got you with me tonight <eos> Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love <eos> Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas <eos> With Waylon and Willie and the boys <eos> This successful life we're livin' <eos> Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys <eos> Between Hank Williams' pain songs and <eos> Newbury's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain <eos> Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain <eos> So baby, let's sell your diamond ring <eos> Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away <eos> This coat and tie is choking me <eos> In your high society you cry all day <eos> We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones <eos> Four car garage and we're still building on <eos> Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love <eos> Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas <eos> With Waylon and Willie and the boys <eos> This successful life we're livin' got us feudin' <eos> Like the Hatfield and McCoys <eos> Between Hank Williams' pain songs and <eos> Newberry's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain <eos> Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain <eos> Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas <eos> With Willie and Waylon and the boys <eos> This successful life we're livin's got us feudin' <eos> Like the Hatfield and McCoys <eos> Between Hank Williams' pain songs <eos> And Jerry Jeff's train songs and Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain <eos> Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain <eos> Songwriters:  Bobby Emmons and Chips Moman <eos>

I still sit around thinking <eos> Wondering what you've been up to <eos> And if you're happy now <eos> Sure looks like she loves you <eos> And the 'what could've been's' <eos> Are always what I come back to <eos> Like it's always been you <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> I realise, it doesn't do me any good <eos> To dream about the good times <eos> And a part of me knows it was the right thing to say goodbye <eos> But I lie awake at night <eos> I toss and turn and wonder why <eos> In hindsight <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 
I should've stayed at home <eos> 'Cause right now I see all these people that love me <eos> But I still feel alone <eos> Can't help but check my phone <eos> I could've made you mine <eos> But no, it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you <eos> And you weren't made for me <eos> Though it seemed so easy <eos> And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one that makes your day <eos> The one you think about as you lie awake <eos> I can't wait to be your number one <eos> I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine <eos> But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry <eos> But won't you wait? <eos> You know it's too late <eos> I'm on my own shit now <eos> Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great <eos> I feel great <eos> Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> You need to be yourself <eos> Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool <eos> That makes your heart melt <eos> Who knows what you truly felt <eos> You're still my favorite girl <eos> You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else <eos> More beautiful in this damn world <eos> In this damn world <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> I said that <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> Best friend <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> I say that I'm happy <eos> I say that I'm happy <eos> But no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, oh <eos> I still wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one that makes your day <eos> The one you think about as you lie awake <eos> And I can't wait to be your number, your number one <eos> I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine <eos> But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry <eos> I still wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one <eos> I might just be the one <eos> 
Must have been a mistake <eos> While you make things hard for me <eos> I wouldn't hurt you at all if I didn't have to <eos> Give in it's our first fight <eos> But now that I see this side <eos> I want to more than I did before <eos> This night has opened my eyes <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> Communication's down <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> We come closer <eos> Temptations, they crumble by your side <eos> You say you wouldn't hurt me at all <eos> Can't be sure that you mean it <eos> If it's worth holding on to, we can't stay in between it <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> Communication's down <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> We come closer <eos> A comfort to us all <eos> Insured against a fall from normal life <eos> Afraid to be at it alone <eos> To shoulder I wonder is it safe for now <eos> This could go either way <eos> It could work out between us, or never again <eos> Make it clean, how realistic we mean to <eos> I know you <eos> 
Dichos oigo y me recuerdan <eos> Me recuerdan noche y dia <eos> De esos tan bonitos días <eos> Que me declaraste viva <eos> Y hoy ando pero ando muy sola <eos> Sola como va la brisa <eos> Mozo tu no me decías <eos> Que se iba a cansar tu risa <eos> Risa que fue calentando <eos> De poquito a poco la mirada mía <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Porque me dejas <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> No dices como, ni cuando <eos> Solo me dejas <eos> Cuando andando por tu barrio <eos> Yo me encuentro a tus amigos <eos> Me dicen que te ven muy triste <eos> Triste por haberte ido <eos> Y eso es lo que yo no entiendo <eos> Amor tu sabes bien <eos> Cuanto es que yo te quiero <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> Tán así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Porqué me dejas <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> No dices como, ni cuando <eos> Sólo me dejas <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada de tí <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada de tí <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada <eos>

I move along <eos> Something's wrong <eos> I guess a part of me is gone <eos> Skies are gray <eos> Start to fade <eos> I guess I threw it all away <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Tired soul <eos> Dying hope <eos> I guess I'm running out of road <eos> I guess I've got nowhere <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Feels like I'm dying <eos> Feels like I'm lying to myself <eos> I know that I'm trying <eos> But it feels like I'm in Hell <eos> I'm in Hell <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos>

Vierte noche y ráfagas de cierzo <eos> Vierte hambre negra de cuchillo <eos> En mi ardiente sangre <eos> En mi pena grande <eos> Vierte azogue y plomo en mis heridas <eos> Tú, en la noche cierta que me aloca <eos> Como un lobo-hombre <eos> Que es de celuloide <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Si entre la gente ya no me reconoces <eos> ¿Cómo subir descalzo a la montaña santa? <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Tu mano helada me devolverá la vida <eos> El contacto de tu piel <eos> La vida intacta <eos> Y ahora sigue robándome el calor <eos> Como aquel amanecer de grises garzas <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Vierte cera, clava espuela y rasga el alba <eos> Tiende capas luengas a mi paso <eos> Que cubran los errores y los juramentos <eos> Calla, que son brillo tus palabras <eos> Calla, de moneda falsa <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Camino solo y la fuerza ya no me alcanza <eos> Hoy ya sé que lo aposté todo a una partida vana <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Junto al río, hogueras <eos> Ebrias sombras danzantes y oxidadas <eos> Escapo aullando al paso siseante de los retrovisores <eos> 
You know the line <eos> Slivers of heaven <eos> Hanging in the breeze like a guillotine <eos> Starved for attention <eos> Nothing would materialize <eos> No spell, no solstice <eos> Either behind bars or you’re tending to the blast furnace <eos> I would never relieve the pressure even if I could <eos> Keeps the senses razor sharp <eos> And does the body good <eos> “You'll be living off candlelight” <eos> Said the main circuit <eos> And the labored pangs of the acid rain <eos> Kept me stirring <eos> I would never relieve the pressure even if I tried <eos> Lost dogs, leap years, all idling by <eos> I was staring through a dull lens <eos> Looking for the edge of the frame <eos> I can't see it following a disillusion <eos> Right up to the end of the page <eos> Takes the drive right out of me <eos> Always tying up a loose end <eos> Waiting for the trumpets to call <eos> I can't hear ‘em <eos> I was dreaming about cold fusion <eos> Listening to the conditioned air <eos> Picking up what's barely there <eos> 
Well, she was an American girl <eos> Raised on promises <eos> She couldn't help thinkin' that there <eos> Was a little more to life somewhere else <eos> After all, it was a great big world <eos> With lots of places to run to <eos> And if she had to die tryin', she <eos> Had one little promise she was gonna keep <eos> Oh yeah, all right <eos> Take it easy, baby <eos> Make it last all night (Make it last all night) <eos> She was an American girl <eos> Well, it was kinda cold that night <eos> She stood alone on her balcony (Ooh) <eos> Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by <eos> Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach <eos> And for one desperate moment there <eos> He crept back in her memory <eos> God, it's so painful when something that is so close <eos> Is still so far out of reach <eos> Oh yeah, all right <eos> Take it easy, baby <eos> Make it last all night (Make it last all night) <eos> She was an American girl (Ooh) <eos> 
Toi mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je rêve c'est de toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je chante c'est pour toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Je ne peux vivre sans toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Et je ne sais pas pourquoi <eos> Je n'ai pas connu d'autre garçon que toi <eos> Si j'en ai connu je ne m'en souviens pas <eos> À quoi bon chercher faire des comparaisons ? <eos> J'ai un cœur qui sait quand il a raison <eos> Et puisqu'il a pris ton nom <eos> Toi mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je rêve c'est de toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je chante c'est pour toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Je ne peux vivre sans toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Et je sais très bien pourquoi <eos> On ne sait jamais jusqu'où ira l'amour <eos> Et moi qui croyais pouvoir t'aimer toujours <eos> Oui, je t'ai quitté et j'ai beau résister <eos> Je chante parfois à d'autres que toi <eos> Un peu moins bien chaque fois <eos> Toi mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je rêve c'est de toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je chante c'est pour toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Je ne peux vivre sans toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Et je ne sais pas pourquoi <eos> Toi mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je rêve c'est de toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Quand je chante c'est pour toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Je ne peux vivre sans toi <eos> Mon amour, mon ami <eos> Et je ne sais pas pourquoi <eos>

I really can't stay (Baby I'm fine with that) <eos> I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that) <eos> This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe) <eos> So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time) <eos> My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming) <eos> Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming) <eos> So really I'd better scurry (No rush) <eos> Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?) <eos> The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl) <eos> What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix) <eos> I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out) <eos> To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about) <eos> I ought to say no, no, no (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to) <eos> Baby it's cold outside <eos> I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here) <eos> Say, where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear) <eos> You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again) <eos> Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?) <eos> We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience) <eos> At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die) <eos> I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night) <eos> 
I took my love, I took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain <eos> And I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart <eos> Rise above? <eos> Can I sail through <eos> The changing ocean tides <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Oooooooh Ooooooooh <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder <eos> Even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makеs you bolder <eos> Even children gеt older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> So take my love, take it down <eos> Climbed a mountain <eos> And turned around <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> The landslide will bring you down <eos> 
Now when I think about it <eos> Never been in love before, no, no <eos> Whenever we talk about it <eos> I question if I'm sure <eos> And now when I think about us <eos> And everything that we are <eos> I'm closer now to acceptance <eos> And I won't cry no more, no, no <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Though we never really talked about it <eos> I never been in love before <eos> But this is something I know <eos> ‘Cause now I don't cry no more <eos> No more, no more, no more <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else, yeah <eos> Living without you <eos> Can we make it through? <eos> What else would I do? <eos> Alone without you <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> 
Tear the feeling from the fool's heart <eos> It seems the meaning just escapes you <eos> And you're nowhere near the worst part <eos> His arrows struck him in this heart he'd never use <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Broken banister will fix him <eos> The flight of stairs has let him through <eos> Bent-over, brought to his addiction <eos> He surfaced once, but his courage was confused <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos>

I hate the way it feels, it is my fear <eos> To be running in circles just to stand still <eos> I need the chaos, I crave the thrill <eos> Feeling its pain is the only thing real <eos> I let it throw its best shots at me <eos> It can punch me in the face, it only sets me free <eos> And I would take a thousand cuts to the throat <eos> Before I live another day in mediocrity <eos> I, I don't belong here <eos> I, I don't belong here <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ridе <eos> But I will choose the crooked linе <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> It's fucking bullshit, I know what I'm seeing <eos> It is a time bomb ticking and I'm heading right to it <eos> It holds me, I don't wanna leave <eos> I've got an itch for the drug <eos> Do anything to consume it <eos> I may crash and burn over and over again <eos> I see the danger around but I'm a masochist <eos> I'm not one to be ashamed <eos> There is no going back, this is the road I've made <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I am all that I have left <eos> I'm understanding <eos> Just not wired like the rest <eos> It's liberating <eos> I am all that I have left <eos> So understand me <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> Not gonna waste my time <eos> Provoked and ready, last chance, I am fucking going off <eos> (Don't even try) <eos> (Don't even try) <eos> I'm ripping up the noise that has been tearing up me <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos>

Absolutely nothing, say it <eos> (War, huh) Lord, lord, lord, lord <eos> (What is it good for?)

Elle avait des bagues à chaque doigt <eos> Des tas de bracelets autour des poignets <eos> Et puis elle chantait avec une voix <eos> Qui, sitôt, m'enjôla <eos> Elle avait des yeux, des yeux d'opale <eos> Qui m'fascinaient, qui m'fascinaient <eos> Y avait l'ovale de son visage pâle <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus d'vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est réchauffés <eos> Puis on s'est séparés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir, aïe, aïe, aïe! <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Au son des banjos je l'ai reconnu <eos> Ce curieux sourire qui m'avait tant plu <eos> Sa voix si fatale, son beau visage pâle <eos> M'émurent plus que jamais <eos> Je me suis soûlé en l'écoutant <eos> L'alcool fait oublier le temps <eos> Je me suis réveillé en sentant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus de vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est séparés <eos> Puis on s'est réchauffés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir ah là là <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Quand on s'est connus <eos> Quand on s'est reconnus <eos> Pourquoi s'perdre de vue <eos> Se reperdre de vue? <eos> Quand on s'est retrouvés <eos> Quand on s'est réchauffés <eos> Pourquoi se séparer? <eos> Alors tous deux, on est repartis <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> On a continué à tourner <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> 
There's a reason for the sun-shining sky <eos> And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high <eos> Must be the season when that <eos> Love light shines all around us <eos> So, let that feeling grab you deep inside <eos> And send you reeling where your love can't hide <eos> And then go stealing <eos> Through the moonlit nights with your lover <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> There's a reason for the warm sweet nights <eos> And there's a reason for the candlelights <eos> Must be the season when those <eos> Love lights shine all around us <eos> So, let that wonder take you into space <eos> And lay you under its loving embrace <eos> Just feel the thunder as it warms your face <eos> You can't hold back <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos>

Hadn't had a good time <eos> Since you know when <eos> Got talked into going out <eos> With hopes you were staying in <eos> I was feeling like myself for the first time <eos> In a long time <eos> 'Til I bumped into some of your friends <eos> Over there talkin' to mine <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Knew it was gonna be a long night <eos> From the moment when <eos> We locked eyes over whiskey on ice <eos> Started talking 'bout us again <eos> If I would've just laid my drink down <eos> And walked out <eos> I wouldn't be in my truck <eos> Driving us to your house <eos> But you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Yeah, you hit me Category 5 <eos> With your smile <eos> Blew me away <eos> And girl, it ain't but midnight <eos> You done killed the lights <eos> Bent my heart back to your bedside <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> 'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart storming <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> 
En la Puerta del Sol <eos> Como el año que fue <eos> Otra vez el champagne y las uvas y el alquitrán <eos> De alfombra están <eos> Los petardos que borran sonidos de ayer <eos> Y acaloran el ánimo para aceptar <eos> Que ya pasó uno más <eos> Y en el reloj de antaño, como de año en año <eos> Cinco minutos más para la cuenta atrás <eos> Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo <eos> Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás <eos> Marineros, soldados, solteros, casados <eos> Amantes, andantes y alguno que otro <eos> Cura despistao Eh <eos> Entre gritos y pitos los españolitos <eos> Enormes, bajitos hacemos por una vez <eos> Algo a la vez <eos> Mmm no <eos> Y en el reloj de antaño, como de año en año Eh <eos> Cinco minutos más para la cuenta atrás Eh ey <eos> Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo Mmm <eos> Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás <eos> Aunque para las uvas hay algunos nuevos <eos> A los que ya no están echaremos de menos <eos> Ya ver si espabilamos los que estamos vivos <eos> Y en el año que viene nos reímos <eos> Uno, dos, tres y cuatro y empieza otra vez <eos> Que la quinta es la una y la sexta es la dos <eos> Y así el siete es tres Uooh <eos> Y decimos adiós y pedimos a Dios <eos> Que en el año que viene <eos> A ver si en vez de un millón <eos> Pueden ser dos <eos> En la Puerta del Sol <eos> Como el año que fue <eos> Otra vez el champagne y las uvas y el alquitrán <eos> De alfombra están <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
At a certain speed on the interstate <eos> Everything looks the same <eos> The blurry green helps me meditate <eos> When everything's always changing <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I took a ride down the boulеvard <eos> To see where we usеd to hang <eos> It's worn down like the rest of us <eos> But that's a quick coat o' paint <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> My mind's racing <eos> Yeah, I just need some four-wheel isolation <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I can't afford that vacation <eos> And you can't see the skyline from the basement <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need (We got everything we need) <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me (You know you got me) <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need, yeah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah <eos>

Uuuuh <eos> No <eos> No, no, no, no <eos> Yo no sé si tú, no sé si yo <eos> Seguiremos siendo como hoy <eos> No sé si después de amanecer <eos> Vamos a sentir la misma sed <eos> Para qué pensar y suponer <eos> No preguntes cosas que no sé, yo no sé <eos> No sé dónde vamos a parar <eos> Eso ya la piel nos lo dirá <eos> Para qué jurar y prometer algo que no está en nuestro poder <eos> Yo no sé lo que es eterno <eos> No me pidas algo que es del tiempo <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> De un cafe pasamos al sofá <eos> De un botón a todo lo demás <eos> No pusimos reglas ni reloj <eos> Aquí estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Todo lo que ves es lo que soy <eos> No me pidas más de lo que doy, no <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un día vivido <eos> No tratemos de correr antes de andar <eos> Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad <eos> No, oh, no, no sé, oh <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Yo no sé si tú, yo no sé si yo, cómo será el final <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Deja que el corazón decida, vida mía, lo que sentimos <eos> Mañana, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo <eos> Quién puede saber lo que pasará mañana, no hay nada escrito <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos <eos> ¡Oye! <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos>

It didn't really take a hundred years to get to twenty-one <eos> It didn't take a whole case of beer to have a little fun <eos> And a fire don't need gasoline and a Black Cat to get lit, nah <eos> But to us it did <eos> That first kiss didn't really get you higher than the moon <eos> And takin' hits off cigarettes didn't really make you cool <eos> That first check from that first job don't really make you rich, naw <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did, yeah <eos> A brand new guitar don't make you a star, and a broken heart don't really break <eos> Don't mean you ain't a man if you didn't cliff jump into that lake <eos> That corner spot in McDonald's lot don't mean a lot to most kids <eos> Ah, but to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> Oh, to us it did, oh <eos> Yeah, runnin' from them blue lights didn't make you Dukes of Hazzard <eos> How hard you punch, how far you hit, it didn't really matter <eos> Oh, wasted time shouldn't qualify for the nights you won't forget, no <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big (Yeah) <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> (Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour) <eos> (That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big) Oh, it wasn't big <eos> (Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers) <eos> (Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly) <eos> But to us it did <eos> 
Reason, all my mind is gone and broken <eos> Seizures, I have lost control of my mind... <eos> Deeper, all I do is fall behind my <eos> Reason, I have lost control of my mind, no... <eos> Another dose down my throat <eos> To ease this affliction <eos> And I feel so cold and numb... <eos> Broken,laying on the ground, Inanimate <eos> Embracing a somatic shut down, Reanimate! <eos> Chorus: <eos> Release me from this prison inside my head <eos> A nightmare of manic thoughts I can't escape <eos> Overthinking, a mental overload in cold sweat <eos> Wish I could erase this and just push reset... <eos> "Om gam ganapataye namaha..." <eos> All alone now... On my own now... <eos> This feeling is unreal <eos> My mind is clouded I can't see clear <eos> I can't stand no more how I feel <eos> And I wish I just disappear... <eos>

'cause I can't show no love <eos> I know that you're missin' me <eos> Deleted your number from history <eos> Don't want me shadin' your captions <eos> You're postin' your girl and I'm laughin' <eos> You was that nigga, what happened? <eos> You let me go and you slackin' <eos> You ain't shit, go and text your bitch, but remember this <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> Thought I was gon' stick around for you <eos> Through all of this shit, I was down for you <eos> My mama, she told me, "You gotta watch niggas closely" <eos> You been creepin' on the low, textin' bitches I don't know <eos> You downgraded with that hoe, still textin' me but she don't know <eos> You still need me, I know <eos> You can't leave me alone <eos> Ain't nothin' like me, she will never be wifey <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> She can't love you like I do <eos> She don't know you like I do <eos> I won that war just for you <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She can't love you like I do <eos> She don't know you like I do <eos> I won that war just for you <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> 
You and I, baby <eos> Maybe we can ride away, baby <eos> And I just wanna get inside, baby <eos> But I don't wanna wait forever <eos> Scared that I can't treat you better than her <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don’t overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it's just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah <eos> I wanna know <eos> I wanna know how to feel, what to feel, what's right <eos> I never know <eos> 'Cause when it gets real, I just run away and hide from you <eos> From you <eos> From you, ooh, ooh <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don't overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it’s just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair?

Ay, así <eos> Oye, pa' gozar <eos> Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo <eos> Ah, jajaja <eos> Soy rara, te lo acepto <eos> Estoy loca, tengo mis defectos <eos> Pérdida, corro de abajo a arriba <eos> Aún no sé fijar la medida <eos> Lento voy retrocediendo, y cuento <eos> El tiempo que no vi siendo un ciego <eos> Olvide mi elemento, la voz, mi instrumento <eos> Lo que me da mi alimento <eos> Voy cayendo cada mañana <eos> Lo siento desde la madrugada <eos> En el campo esto es una batalla <eos> Pero no se me acaban las balas <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Soy positiva en mi presente <eos> Junto los cables, cruzo el puente <eos> Miro al frente, soy valiente <eos> Me hago consciente de mis poderes <eos> Sacudo con fuerza <eos> Mi cuerpo se extiende en la tierra <eos> Rezo por los hombres en guerra <eos> Por las mujeres que cuidan la siembra <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Oye, corazón es mi sitio <eos> Darte lo que yo pueda <eos> Eso es lo que más cuenta <eos> Oye, corazón es mi sitio <eos> Quitarme todos los vicios <eos> Sin tener juicios <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> 
There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> As I look back over my shoulder <eos> All the stars are shining bright <eos> Just like the nights when I used to hold her <eos> She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon <eos> Lover's moon won't you shine on me <eos> I'm dancing with a memory <eos> Wish I may, I wish I might <eos> Have one last chance to hold her tight <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos> There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> Shining down on half of this world <eos> So many souls are in its light <eos> But for me there is just one girl <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos> 
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart <eos> But to movin' on is the hardest part <eos> It comes in waves, the letting go <eos> But the memory fades, everybody knows <eos> Everybody knows <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Maybe months go by, maybe years from now <eos> And I meet someone and it's workin' out <eos> Every now and then, he can see right through <eos> 'Cause when I look at him <eos> Yeah, all I  see is you <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> What if I never get over? <eos> What if I never get closure? <eos> What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya? <eos> What if It never gets better? <eos> What if this lasts forever and ever and ever? <eos> I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got? <eos> What if your love was my one and only shot? <eos> What if I end up with nothing to compare it to <eos> What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Oh, what if I never get over? <eos> Over you <eos>

Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started doing the things you used to do <eos> As I was motorvatin' over the hill <eos> I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille <eos> A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road <eos> Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford <eos> The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five <eos> She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You've started back doing the things you used to do <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four <eos> The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more <eos> It done got a cloud and started to rain <eos> I tooted my horn for the passin' lane <eos> The rain water blowin' all under my hood <eos> I knew that was doin' my motor good <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> The motor cooled down, the heat went down <eos> And that's when I heard that highway sound <eos> The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead <eos> A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead <eos> The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still <eos> And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> 
All my life has been a surprise <eos> Faces cast in gold on the fire <eos> Phantoms colloquial and new <eos> Feelings inside floating through you <eos> All my life leads me to die <eos> Now Sherlock and Watson decide <eos> On a true mystery of the mind <eos> One Arthur Doyle would cease to write <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this time has been wasted to find <eos> The darkness triumphed over light <eos> Is the creator on my side? <eos> Or has he left us all behind? <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this life has been a disguise <eos> Except for the hand in mine <eos> Belonging to my one true love <eos> In Santa Barbara on Hanukkah <eos>

Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> My baby beside me at the wheel <eos> I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile <eos> My curiosity runnin' wild <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> I's anxious to tell her the way I feel <eos> So I told her softly and sincere <eos> And she leaned and whispered in my ear <eos> Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> No particular place to go <eos> So we parked way out on the kokomo <eos> The night was young and the moon was bold <eos> So we both decided to take a stroll <eos> Can you imagine the way I felt? <eos> I couldn't unfasten her safety belt <eos> Ridin' along in my calaboose <eos> Still tryin' to get her belt aloose <eos> All the way home I held a grudge <eos> But the safety belt it wouldn't budge <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> 
Some folks are born made to wave the flag <eos> Ooh, they're red, white and blue <eos> And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief" <eos> Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no senator's son, son <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Some folks are born silver spoon in hand <eos> Lord, don't they help themselves, no <eos> But when the taxman come' to the door <eos> Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no millionaire's son, no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes <eos> Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord <eos> And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?" <eos> Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!" <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no military son, son, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, one <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate son, no no no <eos> 
She is lying yet <eos> That is meaningless and decay <eos> Lying and slight sway "Huge moth" <eos> 
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack frost nipping at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that santa's on his way - <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so i'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to ninety-two <eos> Although its been said many times <eos> Many ways: "merry christmas to you" <eos> 
Oh this perfume, must be something sacred <eos> To linger after you, like it do <eos> This scent's been buried where I rest my head <eos> Pretend to forget but it still feels like you <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Sleep much longer than I did before <eos> Though haunted are dreams evermore <eos> Bless these angels hanging over my head <eos> Still as a tomb though, I'm scared instead <eos> ('Cause) <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Oh you left so much behind <eos> I must be losing my mind, Oh <eos>

I'm a puppet on a string <eos> Tracy Island, time-traveling <eos> Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches <eos> Come to find you four in some velvet morning <eos> Years too late, she's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? Woah, ah <eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end <eos> Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes <eos> Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days <eos> Great escape, lost track of time and space <eos> She's a silver lining climbing on my desire <eos> And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?) <eos> And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways <eos> So in case, I'm mistaken, I <eos> Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby <eos> Are you mine?" <eos> She's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> 
Just a small-town girl <eos> Livin' in a lonely world <eos> She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> Just a city boy <eos> Born and raised in South Detroit <eos> He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> A singer in a smoky room <eos> The smell of wine and cheap perfume <eos> For a smile, they can share the night <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Workin' hard to get my fill <eos> Everybody wants a thrill <eos> Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time <eos> Some will win, some will lose <eos> Some are born to sing the blues <eos> Oh, the movie never ends <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> 
On the way I was crowned a king <eos> Felt the wind underneath my wings <eos> I've been high and I've been low <eos> Played the fool and the star of the show <eos> Gone along for a wild ride <eos> And I can say lookin' in your eyes <eos> That it all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found cynicism, I found criticism <eos> I've been the zero, the hero <eos> And I have been the villain <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> On the way I was given the keys <eos> To the city they were mine to keep <eos> Over time every lock'll change <eos> But you love me all the same <eos> I found pessimism, I found skepticism <eos> I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would have been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> 
There are people in town, man, crazy people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee cola <eos> They believe we are wild, man, they believe we are wild <eos> Just because we don't use any money, and we drink no coffee cola <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> There are people in town, man, weird people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee and cola <eos> Money is what they like most, money is what they like <eos> And people who have plenty of money belong to high society <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> I was told that is to get the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> That is where they can find the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> 
Get off your sled and go to bed <eos> Don't you ever tire? <eos> Throw a bone, I'm finally home <eos> Curled up by the fire <eos> Snow is falling from the sky <eos> Like ashes from an urn <eos> Sweet dreams, my little one <eos> Now it's my turn <eos> Well, Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> Now, when I sleep I like to dream <eos> Of rabbits in the snow <eos> Jumping right into my jaws <eos> From their rabbit hole <eos> Take one home and set him down <eos> Right next to your shoes <eos> Wake up to a big surprise <eos> My gift to you <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> So I'll just stay here and chew <eos>

Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say <eos> Just like children sleeping we can dream this night away <eos> But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the night <eos> We go where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> When we were strangers I watched you from afar <eos> When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart <eos> But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high <eos> I want to celebrate see it shining in the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> 
Wake up, it's a beautiful morning <eos> Honey, while the sun is still shining <eos> Wake up, would you like to go with me <eos> Honey, take a run down to the beach <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> Wake up, there's a new kid in the town <eos> Honey, he's moving into the big house <eos> Remember when I was so very hopeless <eos> Darling, he's gonna make it all better <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> Down, down baby <eos> Down by the rollercoaster <eos> Sweet, sweet baby <eos> I'll never let you go <eos> Oh mama <eos> I wanna go surfing <eos> Oh mama <eos> I don't care about nothing <eos> 
I still can picture him: his hands in his back pockets <eos> He wasn't much for words, but when the wise kids made a racket he'd just have to go downtown <eos> Throw his weight around before starting over <eos> "Say did you hear I've got a band? <eos> Some guys I know from L.A <eos> We'll own the Rio Grande <eos> I'll pay you back next Friday <eos> You know it sure isn't big, just some cats I dig <eos> They said they'd do the gig" <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out in the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun <eos> Not for the younger <eos> Oh Jack Daniels, I feel your hunger <eos> I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not <eos> I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot <eos> You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin <eos> Just a momento <eos> So sad you loved in vain <eos> My comrades lost in battle <eos> The music wars are done from London to Seattle <eos> We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out on the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Ready to die <eos> Now he's ready to die <eos> 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> It's not warm when she's away <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And she's always gone too long <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Wonder this time where she's gone <eos> Wonder if she's gonna stay <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And this house just ain't no home <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know, I know <eos> Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone <eos> But ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> Only darkness everyday <eos> Ain't no sunshine when she's gone <eos> And this house just ain't no home <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> Anytime she goes away <eos> 
The lies, the weight <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> The lies, the weight <eos> It's clear I lost my way <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> Decomposing <eos> I thought I was an architect, but I was just moving dirt <eos> Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> Boring the barriers that kept others away <eos> The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall <eos> So now I know there is no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my lies <eos> Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great <eos> Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape <eos> Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my pride crushing me <eos> Beneath my lies collapsing <eos> But we are still alive <eos> We are still alive <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> My own grave <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive, buried alive <eos> Finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> What I'd become in my own grave <eos> Buried in my own grave alive <eos> 
Let there be peace <eos> Peace to every nation <eos> Let there be hope <eos> For all the world to see <eos> Let there be love <eos> And joy to all the children <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> If I had one wish on a Christmas list <eos> It wouldn't be for presents under my tree <eos> They'd be no more tears for crying <eos> No more wars for fighting <eos> And every mothеr's child would have enough to eat <eos> So whеn I get down on my knees to pray <eos> I ask the Lord above to light the way <eos> And let there be peace <eos> Peace to every nation <eos> Let there be hope <eos> For all the world to see <eos> Let there be love <eos> And joy to all the children <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> When I look in the mirror, all I wanna see <eos> Is true compassion looking back at me <eos> I wanna, I wanna love my neighbor <eos> And be the hands and feet of <eos> Jesus, take his love to the least of these <eos> All I'm asking to be the change <eos> When I get down on my knees, I say: <eos> Let there be peace <eos> Peace to every nation <eos> Let there be hope <eos> For all the world to see <eos> Let there be love <eos> And joy to all the children <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> Let there be peace <eos> Let there be love <eos> Let there be joy <eos> For you and me <eos> Let there be peace <eos> Let there be love <eos> Let there be joy <eos> For you and me <eos> For you and me <eos> Let there be peace <eos> Peace to every nation <eos> Let there be hope <eos> For all the world to see <eos> Let there be love <eos> And joy to all the children <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> (Peace) <eos> (Peace to every nation) <eos> Let there be hope <eos> For all the world to see <eos> Let there be love <eos> And joy to all the children <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> (Peace on Earth) <eos> For you and me <eos> Let there be peace on Earth <eos> For you and me <eos> 
Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear <eos> We're still goodbying <eos> As long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> He doesn't care if it's in below <eos> He's sitting <eos> By the fires glossy glow <eos> He don't care about the cold <eos> And the winds that blow <eos> He just says, let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> Ooh, wee, goes the storm <eos> Why should he worry <eos> When he's nice and warm? <eos> His girl by his side <eos> And the lights turned low <eos> He just says <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> I don't care <eos> Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But that fire is, mmm, delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought lots of corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> When we finally say good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you'll only hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> Long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> 
There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos> 
Come on, skinny love, just last the year <eos> Pour a little salt, we were never here <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer <eos> I tell my love to wreck it all <eos> Cut out all the ropes and let me fall <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Right in this moment, this order's tall <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And in the morning I'll be with you <eos> But it will be a different kind <eos> And I'll be holding all the tickets <eos> And you'll be owning all the fines <eos> Come on, skinny love, what happened here? <eos> Suckle on the hope in light brassieres <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Sullen load is full, so slow on the split <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And now all your love is wasted <eos> And then who the hell was I? <eos> And I'm breaking at the britches <eos> And at the end of all your lines <eos> Who will love you? <eos> Who will fight? <eos> Who will fall far behind? <eos> 
Yo, new Ferrari, red Lamborghini parked <eos> Neon lights, see it when it's dark <eos> Knight Rider whip, guaranteed a chick strip <eos> Get inside the whip, see if you can ride the stick <eos> Parking lot pimp, Cam Big Silk <eos> Put me on to the game, and I ain't been the same since <eos> You ain't getting no money, it makes no sense <eos> Picture me struggling, hustling to pay the rent <eos> No, record label budget, I just made a flip <eos> So I get as much money as music on the strip <eos> Look at my kicks, and extra diamonds on my wrist <eos> And I hit up Joe Finest on the hip <eos> We doing big things something like a pre-historic <eos> Bottles of Henny I down 'em like an alcholic <eos> I'm the shit, yeah, straight outta the toilet <eos> I'm so fly, I can airport it <eos> Check how I ride (I'm just, I'm just, feeling myself) <eos> 26's on the tire (I got money, they feeling my wealth) <eos> I gotta stay fly (No help, I did it myself) <eos> To the second that I die (These in my pants, I'm just feeling myself) <eos> I'm like, mami let's take a flight, and tell your man <eos> He can take a hike, I throw up peace signs at the break light <eos> My cake right, I stay laced right <eos> Nah, no dust on my clothes, I hit the stage like <eos> Glitter and glamour, what up Lounge Lo? <eos> I still, linger with the hammer that was down in Atlanta <eos> Co-sign me, plus I got 50 backing <eos> So haters real mad, my money really stacking <eos> In it like, chill, say I'm overreacting <eos> Regardless of my future, still know me from back then <eos> Nowadays, glide on 'em, G-5 on 'em <eos> They doing boy scout knots, cut ties on 'em <eos> Birthday cake, see I'm bout to rise on 'em <eos> True religion G's, HF designs on 'em <eos> Fly, fresh, fly, fresh, fly, fresh <eos>

If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man <eos> You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me <eos> The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say <eos> I don't share your greed, the only card I need is <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil <eos> Going with the flow, it's all a game to me <eos> Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you <eos> Double up or quit, double stake or split <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools <eos> But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever <eos> And don't forget the joker! <eos> Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me <eos> Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again <eos> I see it in your eyes, take one look and die <eos> The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> 
Yo, this is Action Bronsonelli in the place to be <eos> Peace to the ultimate warrior posted up in Astoria <eos> Bronsolini is the name and when I rhyme its euphoria <eos> To the death of me, motherfuckers seeking that serum <eos> I got the recipe, soft shell crabs right out the Chesapeake <eos> The devil's basil laying lovely in the plastic jar <eos> Open it up from the aroma almost crashed that car <eos> New York livin', linen shorts we too horse driven <eos> And when we sitting down to dine at least there's two course swimming <eos> Probably calamari, my young shooter I call him Gallinari <eos> Still serve the Knicks, nibbles of parmigiani <eos> Hand-craft the cheeses, aged inside the cave to thaw <eos> Off to my tailor alterations for my days in court <eos> Come to the park with my jump shot, got five bets <eos> I'm on price, deadly in the clutch with the precision of a shark bite <eos> After that we split the paper up and spark the pepper flakes <eos> Flying to the heights, Dominican buffet for pepper steaks <eos> You know its Queensbridge you hear the flavour of my music <eos> My brother Lonny manoeuvre huggin' knotties in the Buick, fluid <eos> Close-knit, no shit just like a herringbone <eos> And laid over the sweater of many brothers of  <eos> My aura glistening, my shit's official in <eos> And for my platter's three stars, the book of Michelin <eos> Study Ju-Jitsu in, closets of crystalline <eos> I'm known to rock the green ballys straight out of switzerland, Peace <eos> My facial hair better than Tom Selleck, smoke the bomb tree <eos> Under the palm tree, accent mimicking Connery <eos> Pardon me lady, slow roasted animal smothered in gravy <eos> Flow like the navy, you play me, then you snoring with daisy <eos> Bronsolinio, the motherfucking number one rap singer <eos> The number one rap singer in the universe <eos> Cause I'm the master of the universe, call me He-Man <eos> Mister songwriter, Bronsolini, Bronsolinio <eos> Bronsonolski, Action Bronstein, George Bronstein <eos> Action Castanza <eos> Yo it's Action Bronson <eos> 
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground <eos> And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound <eos> You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down <eos> But wait <eos> You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around <eos> And say (That) <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> Too late, oh, oh <eos> I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh <eos> I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue <eos> And you say <eos> Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you <eos> But I'm afraid <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize <eos> It's too late, oh, oh <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, yeah <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, yeah <eos> I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground <eos> 
Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A s'offrir en partage <eos> Au jour du grand voyage <eos> Qu'est notre grand amour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Mon amour toi et moi <eos> Pour qu'éclatent de joie <eos> Chaque heure et chaque jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour vivre nos promesses <eos> Sans nulle autre richesse <eos> Que d'y croire toujours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour meubler de merveilles <eos> Et couvrir de soleil <eos> La laideur des faubourgs <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour unique raison <eos> Pour unique chanson <eos> Et unique secours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour habiller matin <eos> Pauvres et malandrins <eos> De manteaux de velours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir en prière <eos> Pour les maux de la terre <eos> En simple troubadour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir à ceux-là <eos> Dont l'unique combat <eos> Est de chercher le jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour tracer un chemin <eos> Et forcer le destin <eos> A chaque carrefour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour parler aux canons <eos> Et rien qu'une chanson <eos> Pour convaincre un tambour <eos> Alors sans avoir rien <eos> Que la force d'aimer <eos> Nous aurons dans nos mains <eos> Amis le monde entier <eos> 
Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Esto que siento me supera y no lo aguanto <eos> Sin ti los días pasan sin su encanto <eos> No tengo nada en mi defensa, sabes que no soy un santo <eos> Pero si me lo preguntas, quizá no era para tanto <eos> Yo dando potes <eos> Gritando tu nombre con fuerza pa' que lo notes <eos> Camino donde caminas esperando que te topes <eos> Soñando que me llamas y voy a todo galope <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la nochе ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienеs, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la noche ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienes, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Te quise más de lo que tú me quisiste <eos> Inestable desde que te fuiste y muy triste <eos> Mi consciencia dice: "¿Acaso enloqueciste?" <eos> Y yo no sé qué decirle, me tiembla la voz <eos> Ya no veo tu luz <eos> Ahora estás lejos, ya no hay plenitud <eos> ¿Ahora cómo le haré pa' agarrar altitud? <eos> Me haces falta, no hay como tú, auh <eos> Me acostumbré a no estar solo, uh, uh <eos> Ando ansioso y no lo controlo, uh-uh-uh, uh <eos> Estoy consciente de toda la razón que había en la gente <eos> Te doy tu despedida, mi amor, un beso en la frente <eos> Lo mío por ti seguirá latente <eos> Detente, permíteme mirarte bien, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos>

The night has fallen down the staircase <eos> And I, for one, have felt its bruises <eos> Equilbrium, inebriated <eos> Our social graces have been displaced <eos> As we sink deeper into the drink <eos> The volume increases <eos> Night time resurrects fault lines <eos> Silent wars rumble somewhere below <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The shoe is dropped, lungs explode <eos> Shards of words of a shattered voice <eos> And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> The moon is rising, a revolution <eos> I close my eyes, and the room is spinning <eos> You're screaming, "Sweetie, the moon has raped me <eos> It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me <eos> So I must learn to abort these feelings <eos> This romance is bleeding" <eos> Night time triggers the land mines <eos> Bedroom wounds, lovers like brigadiers <eos> Marching two by two <eos> Marching two by two <eos> A soldier's down <eos> Flood gates burst <eos> I've said things I wish you'd never heard <eos> Like, "There's still a hole <eos> Where the phone was thrown" <eos> It's growing as we speak <eos> And it's sucking us both in <eos> A vacuum of sorrow <eos> To swallow up the day <eos> 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Let your heart be light <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be out of sight <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Make the Yuletide gay <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be miles away <eos> Once again as in olden days <eos> Happy golden days of yore <eos> Faithful friends who are dear to us <eos> Will be near to us once more <eos> Someday soon we all will be together <eos> If the fates allow <eos> Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow <eos> So have yourself a merry little Christmas now <eos> 
Yo te di todo mi amor y más <eos> Y tu no reconoces ni lo que es amar <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Yo se que un día tu volverás <eos> Y tu de todo te arrepentirás <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos>

Christmas night, another fight <eos> Tears, we cried a flood <eos> Got all kinds of poison in <eos> Of poison in my blood <eos> I took my feet <eos> To Oxford Street <eos> Trying to right a wrong <eos> Just walk away <eos> Those windows say <eos> But I can't believe she's gone <eos> When you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Up above candles on air flicker <eos> Oh, they flicker and they float <eos> But I'm up here holding on <eos> To all those chandeliers of hope <eos> Like some drunken Elvis singing <eos> I go singing out of tune <eos> Saying how I always loved you darling <eos> And I always will <eos> Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Down where the sea and city meet <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Maybe they'll bring her back to me <eos> Then all my troubles will be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Oh, Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Light up the fireworks in me <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Those Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos>

The first time the devil looked into my eyes <eos> I knew that he was out to get me <eos> There was no disguise <eos> He's always hiding behind <eos> Nunca me quedo en un solo sitio <eos> Te amaré pero solo visito, ah <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> The first time I heard the galaxy speak <eos> It was between you and me <eos> Now we both have to flee <eos> I can't ever stay in only one place <eos> But in the city of nightmares we both embrace <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> I'm in love with the universe <eos> Oh no, no, no, no, no <eos> Na na na na na na no <eos> Na na na na no <eos> I don't belong to anyone else <eos>

Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> 
Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos>

We get some rules to follow <eos> That and this, these and those <eos> No one knows <eos> We get these pills to swallow <eos> How they stick in your throat <eos> Tastes like gold <eos> Oh, what you do to me <eos> No one knows <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> I journey through the desert <eos> Of the mind with no hope <eos> I follow <eos> I drift along the ocean <eos> Dead lifeboat in the sun <eos> End come undone <eos> Pleasantly caving in <eos> I come undone <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> Heaven smiles above me <eos> What a gift here below <eos> But no one knows <eos> A gift that you give to me <eos> No one knows <eos> Ustedes que son padres de familia... <eos> …Buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el <eos> "DJ Héctor Bonifacio Echevarría Cervantes de la Cruz Arroyo Rojas" <eos> Esta es la radio Quetzalcoatl <eos> Estación donde el rock vive y no muere <eos> Vamos a escuchar un par de temas de Queens of the Stone Age <eos> Primero vamos a escuchar "First It Giveth..." <eos> ...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… <eos> 
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding <eos> Do you even care, if I die bleeding? <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplatin' suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> I never realized I was spread too thin <eos> 'Til it was too late and I was empty within <eos> Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin <eos> Downward spiral, where do I begin? <eos> It all started when I lost my mother <eos> No love for myself and no love for another <eos> Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level <eos> Findin' nothin' but questions and devils <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplating suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Can't go on living this way <eos> Nothing's alright <eos> 
I was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye <eos> I saw a pretty little thing approaching me <eos> She said, "I never seen a man, who looks so all alone <eos> Oh, could you use a little company? <eos> If you pay the right price, your evening will be nice <eos> And you can go and send me on my way." <eos> I said, "You're such a sweet young thing, why you do this to yourself?" <eos> She looked at me and this is what she said: <eos> "Oh there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back <eos> Though you know, I wish I could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good" <eos> Not even fifteen minutes later I'm still walking down the street <eos> When I saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight <eos> And then he swept up from behind, he put a gun up to my head <eos> He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight <eos> He said, "Give me all you've got, I want your money, not your life <eos> But if you try to make a move, I won't think twice." <eos> I told him, "You can have my cash, but first you know I gotta ask <eos> What made you want to live this kind of life?" <eos> He said, "There ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> I got bills to pay, I got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no, I can't slow down, I can't hold back <eos> Though you know, I wish I could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good" <eos> Well now a couple hours passed and I was sitting in my house <eos> The day was winding down and coming to an end <eos> And so I turned on the TV and flipped it over to the news <eos> And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend <eos> I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church <eos> He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills <eos> But even still I can't say much because I know we're all the same <eos> Oh yes, we all seek out to satisfy those thrills <eos> You know there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Money don't grow on trees <eos> We got bills to pay, we got mouths to feed <eos> There ain't nothing in this world for free <eos> Oh no we can't slow down, we can't hold back <eos> Though you know we wish we could <eos> Oh no there ain't no rest for the wicked <eos> Until we close our eyes for good <eos>
