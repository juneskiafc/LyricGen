Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos>

She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore <eos> But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before <eos> And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen <eos> And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans <eos> I asked her what's a woman like you doing here <eos> I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer <eos> She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem <eos> And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans <eos> She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls <eos> But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl <eos> So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream <eos> And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans <eos> We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through <eos> I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true <eos> As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed <eos> A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans <eos> In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say <eos> I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways <eos> And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen <eos> That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine <eos> But I know I’ll always remember the time <eos> A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream <eos> And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> 
August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
No puede haber <eos> Dónde la encontraría <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> No puede haber, desgracia semejante <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> Con iguales emociones, con las expresiones <eos> Que en otra sonrisa no vería yo <eos> Con esa mirada atenta a mi indiferencia <eos> Cuando me salía de la situación <eos> Con la misma fantasía, la capacidad <eos> De aguantar el ritmo despiadado oh oh <eos> De mi mal humor, oh oh oh oh <eos> Y me faltan cada noche todas tus manías <eos> Aunque más enormes, eran así las mías <eos> Y me faltan tus miradas porque sé que están allí <eos> Donde yo las puse apasionadas, oh, oh <eos> Justo sobre tí oh oh oh oh <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que, aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más evidente <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más preocupante <eos> 
Light reflects from your shadow <eos> It is more than I thought could exist <eos> You move through the room <eos> Like breathing was easy <eos> If someone believed me <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> In love, love, love <eos> And everyday <eos> I am learning about you <eos> The things that no one else sees <eos> And the end comes too soon <eos> Like dreaming of angels <eos> And leaving without them <eos> And leaving without them <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> And with words unspoken <eos> A silent devotion <eos> I know you know what I mean <eos> And the end is unknown <eos> But I think I'm ready <eos> As long as you're with me <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos>

Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck? <eos> Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest? <eos> (Panic) <eos> (Panic) <eos> There's something strange going on in this room <eos> The walls are melting, I can hear the ceiling screaming to come down <eos> I can't believe we built this room <eos> It was meant to be a sanctuary, not a prison <eos> There's something strange going on in this house <eos> It's like we're pushing all these buttons, trying to start a war <eos> Amongst ourselves, but we don't know what we want <eos> All we know's that we don't want what they want <eos> What we want <eos> What they want <eos> What we want <eos> What we want <eos> Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck? <eos> Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest? <eos> Can you feel your bones ache like there's something within? <eos> Can you feel your blood pumping inside of your skin? <eos> Can you feel it?

It's not in the way that you hold me <eos> It's not in the way you say you care <eos> It's not in the way you've been treating my friends <eos> It's not in the way that you stayed till the end <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> It's not in the words that you told me <eos> It's not in the way you say you're mine <eos> It's not in the way that you came back to me <eos> It's not in the way that your love set me free <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> It's not in the words that you told me <eos> It's not in the way you say you're mine <eos> It's not in the way that you came back to me <eos> It's not in the way that your love set me free <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Whoah-ooh-ooh <eos> 
I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> 
Build yourself a boat, babe <eos> Make yourself a sail <eos> Float into the ocean <eos> To nowhere <eos> Yeah, I see you're lookin' <eos> Looking for a sign <eos> Praying for a beacon <eos> So here's the light <eos> My arms will be wide open <eos> For the moment you arrive, arrive <eos> When you set sail on your journey <eos> And happiness is far away <eos> Love will guide you 'til the mornin' <eos> Lead your heart down to the bay <eos> Don't resist the rain and storm <eos> I'll never leave you lost at sea <eos> I will be your lighthouse keeper <eos> Bring you safely homе to me <eos> I will be your lighthouse keepеr <eos> Bring you safely home <eos> Yeah, I see you're lonely <eos> Going in alone <eos> Fire up the engine <eos> Stoke the coal <eos> Floatin' on a feeling <eos> Fighting with the tide <eos> Hope you'll be home for Christmas time <eos> My arms will be wide open <eos> For the moment you arrive, arrive <eos> When you set sail on your journey <eos> And happiness is far away <eos> Love will guide you 'til the morning <eos> Lead your heart down to the bay <eos> Don't resist the rain and storm <eos> I'll never leave you lost at sea <eos> I will be your lighthouse keeper <eos> Bring you safely home to me <eos> I will be your lighthouse keeper <eos> Bring you safely home to me <eos> 
This town was built on miles of hope <eos> And I dare you to give me one reason to stay <eos> And maybe I won't go away <eos> So far you've only dared me once <eos> And I think we know that's not even close enough <eos> Not enough for me to stay <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Well I'm getting tired of standing around <eos> Just sitting here and waiting to be found <eos> Same old shit just a different day <eos> Well I'll wait around for one more day <eos> But I know that's what I will always say <eos> Will this ever be O.K.? <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> 
"Follow your bliss," it reads on my chest <eos> I know I got it tattooed for a reason, why can't I just hold it true? <eos> Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals <eos> Of these people that I never knew, yeah! <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything <eos> I shut the door and turn all the lights out, and listen to <eos> All the songs that the night shouts, they go something just like this <eos> So, go fill up a glass with tonic rocks and gin <eos> And drink yourself to happiness <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything <eos> We can all hang ourselves from gold chandeliers <eos> And drink goodbye to all, all the pain and fears <eos> Loose lips have sunk this ship to a shallow grave <eos> Washed up upon the rocks, I won't be saved, I won't be saved! <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I gave up everything <eos> (I won't be saved) So "follow your bliss," it reads on my chest <eos> (I won't be saved) I know I got it tattooed for a reason <eos> (I won't be saved) I shut the door and turn all the lights out <eos> (I won't be saved) And listen to all the songs that the night shouts... <eos>

Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever <eos> It paved a wave of distance between the syntax error <eos> From Austin's yellow brick road, this is forever <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled, no sign of relief <eos> 'Cause this you know, this you know, this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Makes no difference, your alphabet is missing letters <eos> Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather <eos> A drizzle, brisk and profound <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled no sign of relief <eos> This is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Strum this broken harp <eos> We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts <eos> Yes, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Makes no! Makes no! Makes no! <eos> Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather <eos> A drizzle, brisk and profound <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled <eos> Strum this broken harp <eos> We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts <eos> This is forever, no turning back, this is forever <eos> (You know, you know) <eos> Yeah, this is forever, no turning back, this is forever <eos> (You know that this is forever) <eos> But you can't get the best of us now <eos> 
All the time I’ve had to grow <eos> From the valleys, left alone <eos> Said I had to let you go <eos> To read the writing on the wall <eos> Born and raised in <eos> California <eos> Skies were blue <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> Lost in every place I go <eos> But leaving footprints on the road <eos> Won’t be long before you know <eos> Nothing matters anymore <eos> Born and raisеd in <eos> California <eos> Skies were bluе <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> 
Joł, joł, tej <eos> Jeżeli myślałeś, że faktycznie takim smutem skończymy album <eos> To nas nie znasz joł, joł poka cyce, poka cyce ty kurwo <eos> Nadal pierdolę pop i wkurwia mnie emo <eos> Nadal kochamy rap który gloryfikuje przemoc <eos> Nadal rządzi pieniądz, bo ludzie sie nie zmienią <eos> I nadal trwają wojny od czasów pierwszych plemion <eos> To ten nienormalny tenor idę drogą cierni <eos> A Wojtas Wzgórze Ya-Pa 3 to mój imiennik <eos> Styl wciąż nie zmienny Mikser stoi obok <eos> Ja bluzgam, a on wybija rytmy jak dobosz <eos> Jak masz problem z głową to chłopaku nie ćpaj <eos> Bo będzie po nocy cie prześladować wiedźma <eos> Jak chcesz być niegrzeczna to najpierw dorośnij <eos> Bo los nastoletnich matek nieraz bywa gorzki <eos> Podkręć głośnik niech tryska krew <eos> Rozpusta, orgia umarłych ciężki grzech <eos> Zróbmy chlew spalmy tę budę do ostatniej deski <eos> Demonologia to ci lepsi - styl i prestiż <eos> Ulalala w góre wódka <eos> Dzisiaj balujemy tak jak by nie miało być jutra <eos> Ulalala spłonie klub <eos> To jest trzoda synu gęsto ściele sie trup <eos> WSRH (kto?) <eos> WSRH (łapy w góre) <eos> WSRH WSRH <eos> Na bicie mikser A.K.A sutener twojej starej <eos> Kradnie damskie gacie z brudów i opróżni ci barek (hehehehehe) <eos> Chłopaku nalej to noc żywych zwłok <eos> Chce sie tak najebać żeby na pięć minut stracić wzrok <eos> Zapada zmrok w mieście robi sie ciemno <eos> Żyje tam gdzie szczony mają oficjalny beef ze szkielnią <eos> Z Zakopca po Mielno jebać policyjne ścierwo (jebać) <eos> Mój dom to mój tron mój majk to moje berło <eos> Terror w halloween Michael Myers <eos> Zróbcie mosh pit jak by na scenie grał Slayer <eos> Zachodni wiatr wieje synu nadciąga sztorm <eos> Robie swoje pomimo ogólno przyjętych norm <eos> Krwawy tron europy peryferia hostel <eos> Przy tym gównie zboczeńcy będą wkładać fiuta w toster <eos> Północne niszcze bijące serce wysoko <eos> Jak indiański kapłan składający hołd bogom <eos> Jebać diabła synu napluj mu ode mnie w ryj <eos> Wchodze do gry, w której pełno dwulicowych żmij <eos> Jak Stephen King przelewam słowa na papier <eos> Horrorcore to literacka fikcja łapiesz? <eos> Lepiej zmów pacierz synu ja przybyłem by niszczyć <eos> I nawet jak sie położe to jestem od ciebie wyższy <eos> To jest zimny prysznic dla tych samozwańczych kotów <eos> Jak jeż jebać truskul homo rap bez polotu <eos> Bądź gotów przychodze nie spodziewanie jak zgon <eos> Pije browar z gwinta, a nie dom perignon <eos> Mówią mi Słoń propagujemy chore szajse <eos> Nasze płyty sie rozchodzą jak dropsy na Sunrise <eos> Darcie mordy, bas ciężko dudni <eos> Mam w chuju czy masz dres czy zapuszczasz długie kudły <eos> Brudny rap wszystkich pseudo graczy męczy <eos> Przy nas będą jak ministrant w saunie pełnej księży <eos> 
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> And I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> 'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos>

I see the crystal raindrops fall <eos> And the beauty of it all <eos> Is when the sun comes shining through <eos> To make those rainbows in my mind <eos> When I think of you sometime <eos> And I want to spend some time with you <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building castles in the sky <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> We look for love, no time for tears <eos> Wasted water's all that is <eos> And it don't make no flowers grow <eos> Good things might come to those who wait <eos> Not for those who wait too late <eos> We gotta go for all we know <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building them castles in the sky <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> I hear the crystal raindrops fall <eos> On the window down the hall <eos> And it becomes the morning dew <eos> And, darling, when the morning comes <eos> And I see the morning sun <eos> I want to be the one with you <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building big castles way up high <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> 
I know that people change <eos> But I thought that we would stay the same <eos> In a web of your lies <eos> Didn't give me a good reason why <eos> A stupid fight <eos> Set us alight <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You never learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When we're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> You picked him over me <eos> And you left with no apology <eos> Felt a knife in your back <eos> Yeah, you thought I was the killer <eos> You're lookin' in the mirror <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You nevеr learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When wе're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Toxic games you play <eos> Too high price to pay <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Nothing's permanent so <eos> Guess I gotta learn to let go <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You never learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When we're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> 
Yeah <eos> Pack your bags 'cause we got no reason to lay low <eos> What was my line? <eos> Fuck it <eos> Two, three, go <eos> Sing <eos> La-la-la <eos> You always said I'd be a disappointment <eos> That I'd be nothing and I'd probably lose it all <eos> You thought that I would trip and fall <eos> But you'll never see me beg or crawl <eos> Can't take it, won't fake it, punch a hole through the wall, try to break it <eos> Can't change it, rearrange it, so I guess that I'll just have to face it <eos> This is bloody knuckles and I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain, yeah <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> Another day, another disappointment <eos> My head is tripping, might as well just slip away <eos> You all think I'm crazy anyway <eos> You all think I'm crazy <eos> Won't give in, never fit in, it's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> You dig in, don't pretend, I'm already down, but you keep on pushing <eos> Life is a fight, but you don't ever fight fair <eos> Beat us to the ground, but we will never stay there <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> I won't give in, never fit in <eos> It's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> This is bloody knuckles, I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain <eos> Away from all this pain <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos>

No hace falta que me quites la mirada <eos> Para que entienda que ya no queda nada <eos> Aquella luna que antes nos bailaba <eos> Se ha cansado y ahora nos da la espalda <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> Tengo contados todos los besos que nos damos <eos> Y tú fugitiva, andas perdida en otro lado <eos> Yo no quiero caricias de otros labios <eos> No quiero tus manos en otras manos <eos> Porque yo quiero que volvamos a intentarlo <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> (Donde esta el amor) <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> 
I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos>

The cattle are prowlin' <eos> The coyotes are howlin' <eos> Way out where the doggies roam <eos> Where spurs are a jinglin' <eos> And the cowboy is singing <eos> His lonesome cattle call <eos> He rides in the sun <eos> 'Til his days work is done <eos> And he rounds up the cattle each fall <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> For hours he would ride <eos> On the range far and wide <eos> When the night wind blows up and slow <eos> His heart is a feather <eos> In all kinds of weather <eos> He sings his cattle call <eos> He's browned as a fairy <eos> From ridin' the prairie <eos> And he sings with an western drawl <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos>

I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater <eos> You said it looked better on me than it did you <eos> Only if you knew, how much I liked you <eos> But I watch your eyes as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> (Wish I were Heather) <eos> Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand <eos> Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder <eos> But how could I hate her? She's such an angel <eos> But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> (I wish I were Heather) <eos> (Oh) Wish I were Heather <eos> (Oh, oh) Wish I were Heather <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> Wish I were <eos>

Soledad me acompaña <eos> Siempre pa' donde vaya <eos> Nadie nos podrá separar <eos> Lo nuestro no se acaba <eos> De noche y de mañana <eos> Soledad en mi cama <eos> Lo nuestro no va a terminar <eos> Te llevo a donde vaya <eos> Con humo y tequila <eos> Se me va la vida <eos> Escribiendo poesías <eos> Con el alma vacía <eos> Así te quiero, fría <eos> Sencilla y tan mía <eos> Eres mi melodía <eos> De noche y de día <eos> Si el destino quiere <eos> Que tú y yo estemos juntos <eos> Nadie lo va a impedir <eos> Caminemos por el mismo rumbo <eos> Botellas de vino para el dolor <eos> Soy un vagabundo <eos> Y así voy a seguir <eos> Recorriendo el mundo <eos> Botellas de vino para el dolor <eos> Soy un vagabundo <eos> Y así voy a seguir <eos> Recorriendo el mundo, oh, oh <eos> Soledad me acompaña <eos> Siempre pa' donde vaya <eos> Nadie nos podrá separar <eos> Lo nuestro no se acaba <eos> De noche y de mañana <eos> Soledad en mi cama <eos> Lo nuestro no va a terminar <eos> Te llevo a donde vaya <eos> Botellas de vino para el dolor <eos> Soy un vagabundo <eos> Y así voy a seguir <eos> Recorriendo el mundo <eos> Botellas de vino para el dolor <eos> Soy un vagabundo <eos> Y así voy a seguir <eos> Recorriendo el mundo <eos> Si el destino quiere <eos> Que tú y yo estemos juntos <eos> Nadie lo va a impedir <eos> Caminemos por el mismo rumbo <eos> Así te quiero, fría <eos> Sencilla y tan mía <eos> Eres mi melodía <eos> De noche y de día <eos> Con humo y tequila <eos> Se me va la vida <eos> Escribiendo poesías <eos> Con el alma vacía <eos>

An ancient warmth <eos> Under the horizon <eos> Given signs of lights <eos> A solid rising <eos> I knew the void would come to be <eos> I never thought it would complete me <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> Leaves all over me <eos> Buried alive <eos> Flowers of sulfur <eos> A dark future ahead <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> It wasn't always marked by the dark <eos> Once the sun belonged to the stars <eos> The silence surrounded us and <eos> Numbers existed just in minds <eos> In between everything, all, nothing can change <eos> It's such a shame <eos> I missed the rain <eos> That would have taken me far away <eos> A last glance at those lights <eos> I knew I could be moved <eos> I knew that this age was doomed <eos> 
At a certain speed on the interstate <eos> Everything looks the same <eos> The blurry green helps me meditate <eos> When everything's always changing <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I took a ride down the boulеvard <eos> To see where we usеd to hang <eos> It's worn down like the rest of us <eos> But that's a quick coat o' paint <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> My mind's racing <eos> Yeah, I just need some four-wheel isolation <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I can't afford that vacation <eos> And you can't see the skyline from the basement <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need (We got everything we need) <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me (You know you got me) <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need, yeah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 
We got London on da Track <eos> I been all in my phone, I got options <eos> And I don't wanna tell you to drop it <eos> But I don't wanna play unfair, yeah, yeah <eos> Somethin' that makes me look at you too often <eos> And baby, you can give it somethin' <eos> Baby, I can run overtime, oh <eos> Baby, I'm talkin' crazy <eos> I need you right in my space, but I <eos> Need it, baby, I'm late, but I <eos> Still can check in with you <eos> I know that I need my friend, but I <eos> Wouldn't wanna leave you, no, oh, I <eos> Wouldn't wanna plead <eos> But my heart, my mind and my body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin') <eos> My mind, my mind, and my body is <eos> My body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin') <eos> My mind, my mind, and my heart <eos> My body is sayin' <eos> I don't know what it is <eos> I can't tell you what it is <eos> But you got me goin' crazy <eos> Sex with you is so amazin' <eos> How, how long can you go, baby? <eos> Better last 'til my body's sore, 'cause it's crazy <eos> Baby, I'm talkin' crazy <eos> I need you right in my space, but I <eos> Need it, baby, I'm late, but I <eos> Still can check in with you <eos> I know that I need my friend, but I <eos> Wouldn't wanna leave you, no, oh, I <eos> Wouldn't wanna plead <eos> But my heart, my mind and my body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin') <eos> My mind, my mind, and my body is <eos> My body is sayin' (Sayin', sayin') <eos> My mind, my mind, and my heart <eos> My body is sayin' <eos> I know, oh, I <eos> I know, oh, I <eos> I know we ain't gotta talk, alright <eos> I know you ain't gotta talk, alright <eos> Baby, I, I just wanna talk to you <eos> I just wanna talk to you <eos> Don't this shit, don't this shit <eos> Know that we did, oh <eos> 
We should let the mud consume this thing we built <eos> 80 years of drooling turned to streams of filth <eos> Wounds appearing underneath the skin we killed <eos> Head mounted sideways to shun the guilt <eos> Swirling daggers carve their way to open space <eos> Pointy nails embedded into ashtrays <eos> Promises of healing failed to be fulfilled <eos> Head mounted sideways to shun the guilt <eos> Bring out your forces <eos> Bring out your crosses now <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> To see through fingеrs the purge that lingers on <eos> Thеre’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> Bring back my bed <eos> Bring back the voice that fled <eos> Bring back my name <eos> Replay my talkshow game <eos> Bring out your forces <eos> Bring out your crosses now <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> To see through fingers the purge that lingers on <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> Blood has been spilled <eos> I’m saying goodbye for now... <eos> Watching the mill <eos> Turning around somehow... <eos> Blood has been spilled <eos> I’m saying goodbye for now... <eos> 
Yeah <eos> I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze <eos> I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway <eos> Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase <eos> I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah <eos> I battle with depression, but the question still remains <eos> Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage? <eos> And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase <eos> Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day <eos> And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze <eos> Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace <eos> I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace <eos> How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case? <eos> Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste <eos> Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take <eos> But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage <eos> Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention <eos> I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing <eos> And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine <eos> Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave <eos> I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again <eos> Crashed my car just to feel again <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah <eos> Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh <eos> We're sick and tired of wondering <eos> Praying to a god that you don't believe <eos> You're searching for the truth in the lost and found <eos> So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now? <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos>

(Verse 1 : ) <eos> I call you <eos> When I need you <eos> My heart's on fire <eos> You come to me <eos> Come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> Oh, you come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> You bring a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> You speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart baby <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Verse 2 : ) <eos> In your heart I see <eos> The start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Bridge : ) <eos> Each time you leave me <eos> I start losing control <eos> You're walking away <eos> With my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel it even when I'm alone <eos> Oh baby, don't let go <eos> (Chorus :) <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Outro :) <eos> You're the best <eos> 
When your legs don't work like they used to before <eos> And I can't sweep you off of your feet <eos> Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? <eos> Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? <eos> And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy <eos> And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout how <eos> People fall in love in mysterious ways <eos> Maybe just the touch of a hand <eos> Well me, I fall in love with you every single day <eos> I just wanna tell you I am <eos> So honey, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> And maybe we found love right where we are <eos> When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades <eos> And the crowds don't remember my name <eos> When my hands don't play the strings the same way <eos> I know you will still love me the same <eos> 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen <eos> And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout how <eos> People fall in love in mysterious ways <eos> And maybe it's all part of a plan <eos> Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes <eos> Hoping that you'll understand <eos> That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> And maybe we found love right where we are <eos> So baby, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> That maybe we found love right where we are <eos> Oh baby, we found love right where we are <eos> And we found love right where we are <eos> 
Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals <eos> I get my back into my living <eos> I don't need to fight to prove I'm right <eos> I don't need to be forgiven, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ye-ah <eos> Don't cry, don't raise your eye <eos> It's only teenage wasteland <eos> Sally, take my hand, we'll travel south 'cross land <eos> Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder <eos> The exodus is here, the happy ones are near <eos> Let's get together before we get much older <eos> Teenage wasteland, it's only teenage wasteland <eos> Teenage wasteland, oh, yeah <eos> Teenage wasteland <eos> They're all wasted! <eos> 
It make no sense at all <eos> To say where you used to work <eos> It make no sense at all <eos> To say how much you used to earn <eos> It make no sense at all <eos> To say what you used to do <eos> This is the face of Fu Man Chu <eos> It make no sense at all <eos> To say what you used to do <eos> It make no sense at all <eos> To say how much you used to earn <eos> Is not what you earn that make you a man <eos> But is what you keep that make you a man <eos> This is the face of Fu Man Chu <eos> This is the face of Fu Man Chu <eos> 
We might kiss when we are alone <eos> When nobody's watching <eos> We might take it home <eos> We might make out when nobody's there <eos> It's not that we're scared <eos> It's just that it's delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> We might live like never before <eos> There's nothing to give <eos> Well, how can we ask for more? <eos> We might make love in some sacred place <eos> The look on your face is delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> Why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place that you've known? <eos> Why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> 
Once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it <eos> I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage <eos> I wanna drive this car right over the edge <eos> Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet <eos> I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic <eos> Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic <eos> I never meant to be hypocritical <eos> This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it <eos> I tell myself every night, I could live without it <eos> I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness <eos> But every time I do, I make another mess <eos> And just like that, I know there's no looking back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad) <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> 
I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> If you ask, just to show that I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> That it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> A return from unnatural vacation <eos> Left my mind and left my body vacant <eos> To remove from an old situation <eos> To where it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> So wait in the last place you lost me <eos> I aim to change, play the rules <eos> That I've wanted to break <eos> But refuse any longer <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> Just for you, I could show you I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> And never forget <eos> Never forget <eos> Never <eos> 
I can't let you go <eos> Trust me, I've tried and I swear I'm still trying to know <eos> How to move on <eos> If somebody told me, I still wouldn't know where to go <eos> I'd follow the stars <eos> Wish I could see them, the sky feels so dark when you're gone <eos> I'd follow my heart <eos> But you took it with you the day you walked out of that door <eos> No, I can't pretend <eos> That you and I had never met, no, no, no <eos> If movin' on means I should forget <eos> Then even if I could, I wouldn't <eos> No matter what the price is, I would pay <eos> Don't matter if I should or shouldn't <eos> I woulda never gave up anyway <eos> Long nights of cryin' <eos> I felt like I was dyin' every night <eos> Rather keep on fightin' <eos> At least then I've got a reason to fight <eos> You gave me hope <eos> Something to hold on and look forward for <eos> And after it all <eos> You left me with scars and said that you were never involved <eos> You knew I was weak <eos> You sold me a dream and knew I would believe in your lies <eos> What's wrong with me? <eos> I knew you were lyin', but I had no courage to leave <eos> And I can't pretend <eos> That you and I had never met, no, no, no <eos> If movin' on means I should forget <eos> Then even if I could, I wouldn't <eos> No matter what the price is, I would pay <eos> Don't matter if I should or shouldn't <eos> It wouldn't even matter anyway <eos> Then even if I could, I wouldn't <eos> No matter what the price is, I would pay <eos> Don't matter if I should or shouldn't <eos> I woulda never gave up anyway <eos> Long nights of cryin' <eos> I felt like I was dyin' every night <eos> Rather keep on fightin' <eos> At least then I've got a reason to fight <eos> Khalliki ma  trou7i <eos> Ya galbi, ya rou7i <eos> Khabbiki b jrou7i <eos> Khallini ma3ak <eos> (Khalliki ma  trou7i) <eos> (Ya 3omri, ya rou7i) <eos> (Khabbiki b jrou7i) <eos> (I can't let you go) <eos>

Had our share of the pain <eos> Of the clouds and the rain <eos> Lean on me and I’ll lean on you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> I know you’re scared ‘cause you can’t see the light <eos> You toss and turn through the night <eos> Holding me, and I’m holding you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> Where do you go when there’s no road to follow? <eos> Faces look hollow, only strangers to you now <eos> Where do you turn when this living starts to burn <eos> Through layers that you learned to wrap around your heart somehow? <eos> I turn to you <eos> I always do <eos> I turn to you <eos> I know you’re scared, can’t see the light <eos> Got to believe it’s gonna be alright <eos> Lean on me and I’ll lean on you <eos> And together, we’ll get through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> We’ll make it through <eos> We always do <eos> We always do <eos> 
I drank a liter of tequila in my bedroom <eos> It's takin' every ounce of power not to text you <eos> Your body frozen in my mind like a statue <eos> Wish I could scratch off all the letters of our tattoo <eos> I'm a believer, but I keep learnin' the hard way <eos> That ya love's only gonna make my heart break <eos> While I was crying, you were flying at a party <eos> Baby, you play me, like Atari at an arcade <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't dеserve me <eos> I caught you lying with thе Bible in your right hand <eos> Thought you could rule me like I wasn't gonna bite back <eos> I'm sick of manipulative venomous spending all of my time <eos> Second-guessing my mind, keep on taking the high road <eos> But I'm ready to go low, so <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> I was buried alive <eos> But I learned to hold my breath <eos> No, you won't fool me twice <eos> You can't have this back <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> 
You've heard it all, I’ve whispered to my mother next to you <eos> Wanting to be folded in grey and blue <eos> I'll eat the East River before it eats me <eos> But it'll take me before I get the chance to, dig in my teeth <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> You've heard it all I've whispered to my mother next to you <eos> I hate the Hudson River, I'm loyal to you <eos> I’ll eat the scuba divers if they eat me <eos> But they’ll take me before I get the chance to, swallow them whole <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> ’Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not around here, I'm just so sore <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos>

Uuuuh <eos> No <eos> No, no, no, no <eos> Yo no sé si tú, no sé si yo <eos> Seguiremos siendo como hoy <eos> No sé si después de amanecer <eos> Vamos a sentir la misma sed <eos> Para qué pensar y suponer <eos> No preguntes cosas que no sé, yo no sé <eos> No sé dónde vamos a parar <eos> Eso ya la piel nos lo dirá <eos> Para qué jurar y prometer algo que no está en nuestro poder <eos> Yo no sé lo que es eterno <eos> No me pidas algo que es del tiempo <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> De un cafe pasamos al sofá <eos> De un botón a todo lo demás <eos> No pusimos reglas ni reloj <eos> Aquí estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Todo lo que ves es lo que soy <eos> No me pidas más de lo que doy, no <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un día vivido <eos> No tratemos de correr antes de andar <eos> Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad <eos> No, oh, no, no sé, oh <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Yo no sé si tú, yo no sé si yo, cómo será el final <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Deja que el corazón decida, vida mía, lo que sentimos <eos> Mañana, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo <eos> Quién puede saber lo que pasará mañana, no hay nada escrito <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos <eos> ¡Oye! <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> 
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do <eos> Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed <eos> Watching you spin in that dress <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> I keep checking you for halos <eos> Swear you're an angel in disguise <eos> You poke my mind from every angle, and I <eos> I can see Heaven in your eyes <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for <eos> And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful <eos> Oh, baby <eos> 'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees) <eos> Whoa, you make me believe <eos> Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> 
The night has fallen down the staircase <eos> And I, for one, have felt its bruises <eos> Equilbrium, inebriated <eos> Our social graces have been displaced <eos> As we sink deeper into the drink <eos> The volume increases <eos> Night time resurrects fault lines <eos> Silent wars rumble somewhere below <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The surfaces versus <eos> The shoe is dropped, lungs explode <eos> Shards of words of a shattered voice <eos> And there's still a hole where the phone was thrown <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah <eos> The moon is rising, a revolution <eos> I close my eyes, and the room is spinning <eos> You're screaming, "Sweetie, the moon has raped me <eos> It has left its seeds like a tomb inside me <eos> So I must learn to abort these feelings <eos> This romance is bleeding" <eos> Night time triggers the land mines <eos> Bedroom wounds, lovers like brigadiers <eos> Marching two by two <eos> Marching two by two <eos> A soldier's down <eos> Flood gates burst <eos> I've said things I wish you'd never heard <eos> Like, "There's still a hole <eos> Where the phone was thrown" <eos> It's growing as we speak <eos> And it's sucking us both in <eos> A vacuum of sorrow <eos> To swallow up the day <eos> 
They say around the way you've asked for me <eos> There's even talk about you wanting me <eos> I must admit that's what I wanna hear <eos> But that's just talk until you take me there <eos> If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here <eos> Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there <eos> Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know <eos> Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go <eos> Because I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> My every thought is of this being true <eos> It's getting harder not to think of you <eos> Girl, I'm exactly where I wanna be <eos> The only thing's I need you here with me <eos> If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here <eos> Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there <eos> Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know <eos> Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go <eos> Cause I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here <eos> Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there <eos> Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know <eos> Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go <eos> Cause I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> If it's true, don't leave me all alone out here <eos> Wondering if you're ever gonna take me there <eos> Tell me what you're feeling because I need to know <eos> Girl, you gotta let me know which way to go <eos> Cause I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> I need to know, I need to know <eos> Tell me, baby girl, cause I need to know <eos> 
Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling <eos> Do you feel my heart beating <eos> Do you understand <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming <eos> Is this burning an eternal flame <eos> I believe it's meant to be, darling <eos> I watch you when you are sleeping <eos> You belong with me <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming <eos> Or is this burning an eternal flame <eos> Say my name <eos> Sun shines through the rain <eos> A whole life so lonely <eos> And then come and ease the pain <eos> I don't want to lose this feeling, oh <eos> Say my name <eos> Sun shines through the rain <eos> A whole life so lonely <eos> And then come and ease the pain <eos> I don't want to lose this feeling, oh <eos> Close your eyes, give me your hand <eos> Do you feel my heart beating <eos> Do you understand <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming <eos> Or is this burning an eternal flame <eos> Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling <eos> Do you feel my heart beating <eos> Do you understand <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming <eos> Is this burning an eternal flame <eos> Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling <eos> Do you feel my heart beating <eos> Do you understand <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming, ah <eos> An eternal flame <eos> Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling <eos> Do you feel my heart beating <eos> Do you understand <eos> Do you feel the same <eos> Am I only dreaming, ah <eos> Is this burning an eternal flame <eos> Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling <eos> 
I used to think about, immature things <eos> You know like, do you love me, do you want me, are you gon' call me like you said you would, is this really your real phone number? <eos> But you know, I'm a man now baby, a grown man <eos> And I came a long way <eos> And experience taught me one thing <eos> Taught me to hold on to my love <eos> Sometimes, I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you baby <eos> See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you baby <eos> I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing, I'll take anything you bring <eos> Although I love the sunshine, I still like sather rain <eos> 'Cause when I'm in my lonely mood, and I just can't be with you <eos> I tried everything to occupy my mind, and there was no substitute <eos> Thinkin' all that life would be, when you are not around <eos> I just could not find my way, I wouldn't even know up from down <eos> But since I've had you in my life, all things can be found <eos> Strong and true baby, all comin' from you ohh you <eos> Chorus: <eos> I call your name girl (whenever I am lonely baby) <eos> I call your name (when I feel the need of love) <eos> I think of you, and it eases the pain <eos> Take away the strain <eos> 'Cause I don't worry what my people say, in my life today <eos> Although they try to say you're not the one for me, I love you anyway <eos> 'Cause their intentions might be cool, if what they say was true <eos> But there's more to you than they can ever see, and they don't even know you <eos> (Bridge) <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You, I call your name (sometimes, I get lonely babe) <eos> I call your name (I just can't seem to help myself) <eos> I think of you (When I wanted to be alone, so I'll call your, I'll call your name) <eos> I do, you do baby, we do girl <eos> I, I, I love you, you you love me, and and I know <eos> Whoa ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh ohh <eos> I call your name, and it eases the pain <eos> See, I just don't feel all by myself tonight <eos> It seem like someone else is out there, oh thinkin' upon someone else, child <eos> So you will know where I'm comin' from <eos> Ohh when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged, I'll, I'll call your name baby <eos> There is, no substitute, no one could take your place <eos> No more than they can ever see <eos> That's why I call your name <eos> Oh baby, when I am lonely <eos> When I am discouraged <eos> I call your name girl <eos> I think of you, and it eases the pain, take away the strain <eos> (Bridge) <eos> (Chorus) <eos> 
"Son," she said, "have I got a little story for you <eos> What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a... <eos> While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen <eos> Your real daddy was dyin' <eos> Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked" <eos> Oh, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, oh <eos> While she walks slowly across a young man's room <eos> She said, "I'm ready for you" <eos> Why I can't remember anything to this very day <eos> 'Cept the look, the look <eos> Oh, you know where, now I can't see I just stare <eos> I, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah <eos> Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh <eos> "Is something wrong", she said, of course there is <eos> "You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be? <eos> Is that the question? <eos> And if so, if so who answers? <eos> Who answers? <eos> I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Yeah, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Yeah, I <eos> Ooh, I'm still alive! <eos> Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! <eos> Ooh yeah, ooh ooh <eos> Ooh yeah, yeah yeah yeah <eos> 
I've been holding my breath <eos> I've been counting to 10 <eos> Over something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm alone in my bed <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on (Oh, I) <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that gives you <eos> All of the things I could not know <eos> 'Cause I keep fighting all the way <eos> I let you down so I could stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go <eos> And, baby, I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
De nada sirve el porque <eos> De nada sirve el valor <eos> De nada sirve volver <eos> De nada sirve el adiós <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Yo me pregunte hasta cuando <eos> Te querré como hasta hoy <eos> Vos me enseñaste llorando <eos> Que de nada sirve el adiós <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Me gusta lo que no tengo y quiero lo que no doy <eos> No me compren no a mi mismo <eos> No se entregarte la vida tampoco vivir sin vos <eos> Yo se que de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Podre caerme a pedazos pero acá siempre estas vos <eos> Mi jardín ya no te espera porque ya corte la flor <eos> Y todo lo que me queda es cantarte con el alma si te regale la voz <eos> Seguro de nada sirve <eos> Mi amor <eos> Mi amor <eos> Mi amor seguro de nada sirve <eos> Porque ya corte la flor <eos> Mi amor seguro de nada sirve <eos> 
Heart beats fast <eos> Colors and promises <eos> How to be brave <eos> How can I love when I'm afraid to fall? <eos> But watching you stand alone <eos> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> Time stands still <eos> Beauty in all she is <eos> I will be brave <eos> I will not let anything take away <eos> What's standing in front of me <eos> Every breath <eos> Every hour has come to this <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> One step closer <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> 
She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending" <eos> I'll keep stealing, breathing her <eos> Birds are leaving over autumn's ending <eos> One of us will die inside these arms <eos> Eyes wide open <eos> Naked as we came <eos> One will spread our ashes 'round the yard <eos> She says, "If I leave before you, darling <eos> Don't you waste me in the ground" <eos> I lay smiling like our sleeping children <eos> One of us will die inside these arms <eos> Eyes wide open <eos> Naked as we came <eos> One will spread our ashes 'round the yard <eos> 
The sun is shining, the grass is green <eos> The orange and palm trees sway <eos> There's never been such a day <eos> In Beverly Hills, L.A <eos> But it's December the twenty-fourth <eos> And I am longing to be up North <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the ones I used to know <eos> Where the treetops glisten and children listen <eos> To hear sleigh bells in the snow <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> With every Christmas card I write <eos> May your days be merry and bright <eos> And may all your Christmases be white <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the ones I used to know <eos> Where the treetops glisten and children listen <eos> To hear sleigh bells in the snow <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> With every Christmas card I write <eos> May your days be merry and bright <eos> And may all your Christmases be white <eos> May your days be merry and bright <eos> And may all your Christmases be white <eos> And may all your Christmases be white (All your Christmases be white) <eos> And may all your Christmases be white (All your Christmases be white) <eos> And may all your Christmases be <eos> (All your Christmases be white) <eos> (All your Christmases be white) <eos>

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> 
There's another world inside of me that you may never see <eos> There's secrets in this life that I can't hide <eos> But somewhere in this darkness <eos> There's a light that I can't find <eos> Well maybe it's too far away, yeah <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When your education x-ray <eos> Cannot see under my skin <eos> I won't tell you a damn thing <eos> That I could not tell my friends <eos> Roaming through this darkness <eos> I'm alive, but I'm alone <eos> And part of me is fighting this <eos> But part of me is gone <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; <eos> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow <eos> In the bleak midwinter, long ago <eos> Our god, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; <eos> Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign <eos> In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed <eos> The lord God almighty, jesus christ <eos> Angels and archangels may have gathered there <eos> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; <eos> But his mother only, in her maiden bliss <eos> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss <eos> What can I give him, poor as I am? <eos> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; <eos> If I were a wise man, I would do my part; <eos> Yet what I can I give him: give my heart <eos>

De los Corredones originales <eos> Con mis compas de Grupo Firme <eos> Dice, más o menos, así <eos> Yo no soy lúcido, mucho menos presumido <eos> Pero sí me doy a respetar <eos> A los envidiosos vieran cómo los detesto <eos> Porque nomás hablan por hablar <eos> Pacas de billetes, produciendo diariamente <eos> Pues, mi meta ha sido duplicar <eos> Odio las mentiras, pero adoro a mi familia <eos> Y por ellos yo voy a luchar <eos> Y la Cruz de Elota llevo en mi pecho <eos> Ranchito que no he de olvidar <eos> Revivir mi infancia, pero ya tengo ganancias <eos> Y, gracias a Dios, ya andamos bien vestidos <eos> Zapatito' fino' los que me ven aportar <eos> Ahorita andamos bateando, poco a poco progresando <eos> Y nadie me va a tumbar <eos> Y pura Marca MP con Bachato <eos> Así suena Grupo Firme, compa' Edwin (Uh) <eos> Y la Banda Nuevo Estilo, mi viejo <eos> Y puro music VIP, viejo <eos> Puro art and music, viejo <eos> No soy traficante, pero festejo a lo grande <eos> Y con amigos jalo un buen bandón <eos> Tengo mil veinte años y el que ocupe de mi mano <eos> Tendrá cien por ciento mi apoyo <eos> Ni rico ni pobre, pero tengo lo que quiero <eos> Y mis gustos siempre me los doy <eos> Mucho le agradezco al viejón por sus consejos <eos> Y por todo lo que me inculcó <eos> Y mientras hay que disfrutar la vida <eos> Porque cualquier día se nos va <eos> Muchas cosas me han pasado <eos> Pero nunca me he quebrado <eos> Y todo gracias al Señor de arriba <eos> Que me cuida y me protege todo el tiempo del mal <eos> Por el valle ruleteando, en mi carro ando zumbando <eos> El güero, se oye mentar <eos> Ahí nomás, pa' las Cocas (Uh) <eos> 
Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Life just got in the way, don't know what to say <eos> She's heard it all before, lying on her bedroom floor <eos> Thinking my life has to be worth more <eos> She dreams of going to New York City <eos> Her heart's already there but her head's fighting a war <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking for a star but it's just too dark <eos> When streams get a little bit wider <eos> And it's hard to swim across the water <eos> And the scars get a little bit deeper <eos> And a flame turns into a fire <eos> Tonight whеn you need a way home <eos> Someone to lеan on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> Old man trying to make it on his own <eos> Looking at the space where his wife once was <eos> Wants to find just something to believe in <eos> He hears a knock at the door this evening <eos> She says I'm going to New York City to follow my dreams <eos> Would you come with me? <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking at the stars in her granddad's eyes <eos> And the streams get a little bit wider <eos> But together they cross the river <eos> And the scars get a little bit lighter <eos> And the sky looks a little brighter <eos> Tonight when you need a way home <eos> Someone to lean on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos>

Well, I lost my heart on the day we met <eos> But I gained a lot and that I don't regret <eos> Then I hung around 'til you said I do <eos> I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name <eos> And neither one of us will ever be the same <eos> And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue <eos> 'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night <eos> And the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, I count my blessings every night I pray <eos> That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day <eos> And every day He does, 'cause God knows too <eos> That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on cold dark night <eos> Then the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you <eos> Well I've already said it but I swear it's true <eos> I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> 
Era uma vez <eos> Um rasgo de magia <eos> Dança de sombra e de luz <eos> De sonho e fantasia <eos> Num ritual que me seduz <eos> Cinema que me dás tanta alegria <eos> Deixa a música <eos> Crescer nesta cadência <eos> Na tela do meu caração <eos> Voltar a ser criança <eos> E assim esquecer a solidão <eos> Os alhos a brilhar <eos> Numa sala escura <eos> Voa a 24 imagens por segundo <eos> Meu comovida caração <eos> Aprendeu a voar <eos> Neste Cinema Paraíso <eos> Que eu trago no olhar <eos> E também no sorriso <eos>

Well I chased her down the alley <eos> And over the hill to steal her will <eos> She was as hot as Georgia asphalt <eos> When the "A" crowd came to adore her brain <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> You should've seen her back in the city <eos> Poetry and jewels, broke all the rules <eos> She was as high as a Georgia pine tree <eos> Makeup and pills, overdue bills <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> Some sunny day when the hands of time <eos> Have had their way <eos> You'll understand why it was so hard to run away <eos> She's a loser she's a forgiver <eos> But she still finds good where no one could <eos> You ought to want her more than money <eos> Cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos>

When we met, it all happened so fast <eos> You said you loved me <eos> And that it would last <eos> But now it seems that it was all a lie <eos> And all my love for you will soon pass you by <eos> My love for you will never be the same <eos> My heart still aches <eos> From the sorrow and the pain <eos> Time has come for me to say goodbye <eos> Although the precious times <eos> Will never leave my mind <eos> Why did you have to change on me <eos> Your love was so easy and sweet <eos> Oh boy, I gave you all my time <eos> But why couldn't I make you mine <eos> Changing your love was the best thing to do <eos> My love wasn't strong for both me and you <eos> You go your own way, baby <eos> And I'll go mine <eos> Searching for the love we both hope to find <eos> If you decide to come back to me <eos> I'll be waiting so desperately <eos> Until then, I will find <eos> Someone to love me all of the time <eos> My love for you will never be the same <eos> My heart still aches <eos> From the sorrow and the pain <eos> Time has come for me to say goodbye <eos> Although the precious times <eos> Will never leave my mind <eos> 
You were a child crawling on your knees toward it <eos> Making mama so proud but your voice is too loud <eos> We like to watch you laughing <eos> You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> The water is warm but it's sending me shivers <eos> A baby is born crying out for attention <eos> The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror <eos> Decision to decisions are made and not bought <eos> But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> 
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen <eos> Pour myself a cup of ambition <eos> Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life <eos> Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin' <eos> Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin' <eos> With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, for service and devotion <eos> You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion <eos> Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me <eos> I swear sometimes that man is out to get me <eos> Mmmmm... <eos> They let you dream just to watch them shatter <eos> You're just a step on the boss man's ladder <eos> But you got dreams he'll never take away <eos> In the same boat with a lot of your friends <eos> Waiting for the day your ship will come in <eos> And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and you never get the credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos> 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos>

Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear <eos> And I, I can't help but ask myself <eos> How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer <eos> It's driven me before <eos> And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal <eos> But lately I'm <eos> Beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos> So if I decide to waiver my chance <eos> To be one of the hive <eos> Will I choose water over wine <eos> And hold my own and drive? <eos> Oh <eos> It's driven me before <eos> And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around <eos> But lately I'm <eos> Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos> Would you choose water over wine? <eos> Hold the wheel and drive <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos>

Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> You don't know how lucky you are <eos> You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin' <eos> For something bound to fall apart <eos> Everytime you're feeling empty <eos> Better thank your lucky stars <eos> If you ever felt one breaking <eos> You'd never want a heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> You don't know how lucky you are <eos> I've been on the road that you're on <eos> It didn't get me very far <eos> You ain't missing nothing <eos> 'Cause love is so damn hard <eos> Take it from me darling <eos> You don't want a heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> I'm glad we talked this out <eos> You can take mine if you want it <eos> It's in pieces now <eos> By the way there Mr. Tin Man <eos> If you don't mind the scars <eos> You give me your armor <eos> And you can have my heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> 
I wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight <eos> I wouldn't even put up a fight <eos> I wouldn't care if you took it all away today <eos> I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain <eos> But I know I've got to live my life <eos> And roll around on the ground and feel the strife <eos> And realize along the way that I'm nothing more than <eos> A grain of salt in the salt of the earth, and everything is grace <eos> So come on with the darkness <eos> Come on with the fear <eos> Cause I've got to start somewhere <eos> And it might as well be here <eos> And when I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight <eos> I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride <eos> And laugh at myself, laugh at myself <eos> Laugh at myself, laugh at myself <eos> Laugh at myself <eos>

Miren como nos hablan de libertad <eos> Cuando de ella nos privan en realidad <eos> Miren como pregonan tranquilidad <eos> Cuando nos atormenta la autoridad <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Miren como nos hablan del paraíso <eos> Cuando nos llueven penas como granizo <eos> Miren el entusiasmo con la sentencia <eos> Sabiendo que mataban a la inocencia <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> El que oficia la muerte como un verdugo <eos> Tranquilo esta tomando su desayuno <eos> Con esto se pusieron la soga al cuello <eos> El quinto mandamiento no tiene sello <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Mientras más injusticias, señor Fiscal <eos> Más fuerza tiene mi alma para cantar <eos> Lindo segar el trigo en el sembrao <eos> Regado con tu sangre Julián Grimau <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> 
Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear <eos> We're still goodbying <eos> As long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> He doesn't care if it's in below <eos> He's sitting <eos> By the fires glossy glow <eos> He don't care about the cold <eos> And the winds that blow <eos> He just says, let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> Ooh, wee, goes the storm <eos> Why should he worry <eos> When he's nice and warm? <eos> His girl by his side <eos> And the lights turned low <eos> He just says <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> I don't care <eos> Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But that fire is, mmm, delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought lots of corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> When we finally say good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you'll only hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> Long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> 
A clean up woman is a woman who <eos> Gets all the love we girls leave behind <eos> The reason I know so much about her <eos> Is because she picked up a man of mine <eos> Jumpin' slick was my ruin <eos> 'Cause, I found out all I was doin' <eos> Was making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, oh yeah <eos> Just making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my baby's love, uh-huh, mhm <eos> I took this man's love and put it on a shelf <eos> And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself <eos> When you needed love I was out having fun <eos> But I found out that all I had done <eos> Was made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, uh-huh <eos> Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To steal my baby's love, oh yeah <eos> The clean up woman will wipe his blues away <eos> She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day <eos> The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet <eos> She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street <eos> So take a tip, you better get hip <eos> To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough <eos> I mean, she really cleans up <eos> 
Uno por pobre y feo, home, pero antojao' <eos> Ah, hijueputa <eos> Tengo la camisa negra, hoy mi amor está de luto <eos> Hoy tengo en el alma una pena y es por culpa de tu embrujo <eos> Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele <eos> Mal parece que solo me quedé <eos> Y fue pura todita tu mentira <eos> Qué maldita mala suerte la mía <eos> Que aquel día te encontré <eos> Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor <eos> Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor <eos> Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós <eos> Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo <eos> Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby, te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra y debajo tengo el difunto <eos> ¡Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita! ¡Juya! <eos> Así como lo oye, mija <eos> Tengo la camisa negra, ya tu amor no me interesa <eos> Lo que ayer me supo a gloria hoy me sabe a pura <eos> Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas, ni siquiera muestras señas <eos> Y yo con la camisa negra y tus maletas en la puerta <eos> Mal parece que solo me quedé <eos> Y fue pura todita tu mentira <eos> Que maldita mala suerte la mía <eos> Que aquel día te encontré <eos> Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor <eos> Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor <eos> Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós <eos> Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo <eos> Tengo la camisa negra <eos> Porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma <eos> Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby <eos> Te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra <eos> Y debajo tengo el difunto <eos> Tengo la camisa negra <eos> Porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma <eos> Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby <eos> Te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra <eos> Y debajo tengo el difunto <eos> 
Intro <eos> Oye, soy yo... <eos> Tu cuquito otra vez... <eos> Uufff.. <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Resistiré, yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré <eos> Te dije que yo sigo acabando... <eos> 'Si hombre <eos> Resisteré <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Yo resistiré, resistiré <eos> Yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré brother <eos> Resistiré etc etc.... <eos> 
Let's stay together <eos> I, I'm so in love with you <eos> Whatever you want to do is alright with me <eos> 'Cause you make me feel so brand new <eos> And I want to spend my life with you <eos> Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together <eos> Ooh, loving you forever is what I need <eos> Let me be the one you come running to <eos> I'll never be untrue <eos> Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together <eos> Lovin' you whether <eos> Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad <eos> Why somebody, why people break up <eos> Turn around and make up, I just can't see <eos> You'd never do that to me, would you baby? <eos> Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do <eos> Let's, we ought to stay together <eos> Lovin' you whether <eos> Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad <eos> C'mon, let's, let's stay together <eos> I'll keep on lovin' you whether <eos> Whether times are, oh times are good or times are bad <eos> 
The cycle repeated <eos> As explosions broke in the sky <eos> All that I needed <eos> Was the one thing I couldn't find <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> The colors conflicted <eos> As the flames climbed into the clouds <eos> I wanted to fix this <eos> But couldn't stop from tearing it down <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Caught in the burning glow <eos> And I was there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let you know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> You told me yes, you held me high <eos> And I believed when you told that lie <eos> I played soldier, you played king <eos> And struck me down when I kissed that ring <eos> You lost that right to hold that crown <eos> I built you up but you let me down <eos> So when you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> 
Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Enfrentarlo y no puedo, no puedo <eos> En el viaje perdí mi verdad <eos> Siendo una estrella dejé de brillar <eos> Mil voces comenzaron hablar (Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla) <eos> Mi subconsciente comenzó atacar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Cada noche el silencio es un mar (Un mar) <eos> En él me ahoga una tempestad <eos> Camino y corro para borrar (Para borrar, para borrar) <eos> Y en mi locura todo cuestionar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> En la tormenta que habita en mí <eos> El sol brilla fuerte y lo puedo sentir <eos> Puede envolverme alma y mente <eos> Sentir que puedo seguir <eos> Quiero hablar y yo puedo <eos> Respirar y yo puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y yo puedo <eos> Quiero estar, y yo puedo <eos> Escuchar y yo puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme, yo puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad <eos>

I'm turning in I think it?s time for me to go <eos> I'd let you in but I just wanna take it slow <eos> Look a little closer it's not hard to know <eos> We got something more and that?s not typical <eos> When I first saw your face I didn't look again <eos> I didn't go there cause I just got myself up again <eos> But you know what to say to take my breath away <eos> And I had no idea that things would change <eos> Chorus <eos> I?m saving up every word <eos> Keepin' em together cause they sound so good <eos> I?m holding onto every word <eos> That?s whats got me feeling alive yeah <eos> Every word you say is like it?s from a poem <eos> Sending me to places I have never known <eos> Something bout our vibe is like a chemical <eos> If we don?t do this right I think it might explode <eos> When I first saw your face <eos> I didn?t look again <eos> I didn?t go there cause I just got myself up again <eos> But you know what to say to take my breath away <eos> And I had no idea that things would change <eos> Chorus <eos> I?m saving up every word <eos> Keepin' em together cause they sound so good <eos> I?m holding onto every word <eos> That?s whats got me feeling alive yeah <eos> 
Honey, you <eos> You can get on a train <eos> Take it to another town <eos> Leave your friends behind <eos> And you <eos> You could even change your clothes <eos> Throw away your blue jeans <eos> Trade em for a suit and tie <eos> But after all this time <eos> I'm still getting used to having you around <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> It's alright <eos> If you wanna start again <eos> Own a little piece of land <eos> Watch the way things grow <eos> And I, I could even follow you there <eos> I could keep the fire lit <eos> Forget what I used to know <eos> I might like the way your face turns brown in the summer <eos> When we're living out in the sun <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> After all this time <eos> I think I'm getting used to having you around <eos> So please <eos> So please <eos> Please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things that you don't need, you don't need <eos> 
You don't remember do you, how many times I called your name <eos> Don't mean nothing to you, our separate lives, our lonely days <eos> Suddenly you're asking me to stay <eos> What do you want me to say? <eos> By this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> And every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> Didn't you hear the sirens, baby? <eos> Didn't you see the flames? <eos> So don't complain <eos> If this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> Every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> You have my affеction any time, any place <eos> Call it reconnеction <eos> Call it love <eos> Or the chase <eos> But oh, if you would give me your protection <eos> Instead of giving me so much space <eos> By this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> And every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> 
I'm drunk off your kiss <eos> For another night in a row <eos> This is becoming too routine for me <eos> But I didn't mean to lead you on <eos> And it's alright to pretend <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for show, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Please tell me everything <eos> That you think that I should know <eos> About all the plans you made <eos> When I was nowhere to be found <eos> And it's alright to forget <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for fun, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> You need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> (Everything I wanted) <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back for you <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you! <eos> 
Méteme porque estoy cogiendo el vuelo <eos> En ser el primero en bajarla de las estrellas del cielo <eos> No quiero fuego <eos> Ya llevo mechero <eos> Y si aunque quede mejor igual te pido un Ibuprofeno <eos> Hermano <eos> Iba hasta arriba de Barceló en el maletero <eos> Que no quiero sueldos por ser rapero <eos> Que si cobrara algo lo gastaría en pampero <eos> Me toca cambiar más de suegro que de calcero <eos> Pintalabios negro <eos> Nena vente pa' mi concierto <eos> Dando vueltas por el centro <eos> Dando vueltas sobro el si quiero <eos> O no <eos> Perro viejo <eos> Invito <eos> Bebiendo añejo <eos> A palo seco <eos> A pelo <eos> "Burguer" cinco entrellas <eos> Special one <eos> Echa la ley <eos> Echa la trampa <eos> Y dijeron que no llegaría <eos> Pero dijeron mal <eos> Creían que no lo lograría <eos> Pero creyeron mal <eos> Yo sigo pico y pala <eos> Eh papá <eos> Fui ese uno de mil <eos> No quise a ninguno <eos> Sólo a mí <eos> Definición de superación desde que nací <eos> Orgulloso de vivir <eos> Lo que viví <eos> Llevándome el oro <eos> Como un bandolero <eos> (Pum, pum) <eos> Haciendo del viejo oeste en el este <eos> En su cuerpo el podium <eos> En mi vida el desastre <eos> Primera plaza <eos> Perro de presa nunca pudo con el perro de caza <eos> Con todo puedo <eos> Con cada te quiero cielo <eos> En la cuneta sin triángulos <eos> Y tú, reza, reza <eos> Alekay, Alekay <eos> Por todos lados <eos> Se ríen pero el tanto ríe algún día se lamenta <eos> A mí tan solo me pasa cuando pienso en perderla <eos> Dije representando a Monzón <eos> (Eh) <eos> Y eso chirría <eos> Sigo con mi gente cada día <eos> Sigo partiéndola <eos> Como el primer día <eos> "Alekay's", maravilla <eos> Ciudad bendita <eos> I'm the fucking fruta prohibida <eos> Esos rapers la manzana podrida <eos> Me pongo los cascos y es tan solo mover los labios <eos> Llego tarde <eos> Por miedo a que sea demasiado pronto <eos> Solo quedan cenizas de lo que arde <eos> La quiero ante todo <eos> Me meti en este mundillo hasta el fondo <eos> Lucharemos codo con codo <eos> Por salir de este pozo <eos> Hermano <eos> Vamos subiendo, bajando <eos> Yo soy el Natos <eos> Donde esta mi Waor <eos> La crítica eso es la envidia de no poder lograrlo <eos> Postureo, postureo <eos> Niñas con el Desperados <eos> Yo bebiendo Vodka 40 grados <eos> Buscando a tu amor en los vasos <eos> (Ah, ah) <eos> (Buscando a tu amor en los vasos) <eos> El niño encantador <eos> Que nunca se encanto <eos> Aragón Prim <eos> Representando Monzón <eos> (Eh) <eos> Representing BH <eos> Galego <eos> Aquí rulamos con "Estrella Galicia" en packs <eos> "Ámbar" <eos> Non "Starbucks" <eos> BH <eos> (Ah, ah) <eos> 
I got a heart and I got a soul <eos> Believe me, I will use them both <eos> We made a start, be it a false one I know <eos> Baby, I don't want to feel alone <eos> So kiss me where I lay down <eos> My hands pressed to your cheeks <eos> A long way from the playground <eos> I have loved you since we were eighteen <eos> Long before we both thought the same thing <eos> To be loved and to be in love <eos> All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you <eos> I wanna love like you made me feel <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> We took a chance, God knows we've tried <eos> Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine <eos> So pour me a drink, oh love <eos> Let's split the night wide open <eos> And we'll see everything we can <eos> Living love in slow motion, motion, motion <eos> So kiss me where I lay down <eos> My hands pressed to your cheeks <eos> A long way from the playground <eos> I have loved you since we were eighteen <eos> Long before we both thought the same thing <eos> To be loved and to be in love <eos> All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you <eos> And I wanna love like you made me feel <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> Oh Lord, when we were eighteen <eos> Kiss me where I lay down <eos> My hands pressed to your cheeks <eos> A long way from the playground <eos> I have loved you since we were eighteen <eos> Long before we both thought the same thing <eos> To be loved and to be in love <eos> And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you <eos> And I wanna love like you made me feel <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> I wanna love like you made me feel <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> I wanna love like you made me feel <eos> When we were eighteen <eos> 
Fall down <eos> Marigold <eos> Fall sounds of rain <eos> Why can't I go <eos> Those days when spokes wound baseball cards tear hear them roar <eos> And faster still those boards which let fly souls <eos> Honeysuckle walk right afternoon time dies <eos> Wish for sometime soon <eos> I'll work it out <eos> My way <eos> So many faces <eos> So lost <eos> Why can't I go back when this mess was not made <eos> Forever turns out just the same as two months <eos> That rages on then after <eos> 
Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> And tell me, have you found a new man? <eos> Tell me, have you moved on? <eos> 'Cause me, I'm gettin' tired <eos> And this road, it's gettin' hard <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> And it's a fucked up situation I put us in <eos> When the woman I left you for left me for another man <eos> And I guess I should apologize <eos> But I never could lay down my pride <eos> 'Cause it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> Oh <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back <eos> Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> 
Oh, never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop to think <eos> That I'd find myself here with you <eos> In your own world of dreams <eos> Oh, but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> Sometimes I stop and ask <eos> And wonder where you were <eos> Then I rip you from my mind <eos> Cause I thought you didn't care <eos> Oh but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> This time I know <eos> That my heart is true <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> I don't know why <eos> I had to play the game of losing you <eos> To make me see <eos> That I still love you <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> But here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oh no, oh no! <eos> Never never, ooh never baby <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> I just can't stop <eos> No, no, no <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oooh  <eos> 
Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> I'm trying to make a brand new friend <eos> And everybody trying to fight <eos> It ain't easy, it ain't fair <eos> Is the world so messed up <eos> Am I the only one to care? <eos> So much love that I'm willing to share, alright, yeah <eos> I've got it right here <eos> So many things that I'm trying to do right <eos> Trying to make friends <eos> But everyone wanna fight <eos> Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> Working from early in the morning <eos> Up until the edge of night <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> I've been so many places <eos> City from town to town <eos> Looking for a real good woman <eos> They all seem to turn me down <eos> I'm looking for a Louisiana girl <eos> To put into my placе <eos> So when I wake up in the morning <eos> Thеre'd be a smile on her face <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Ooh, belong <eos> And I'll tell you one more thing <eos> I'm used to dealing with doubt <eos> Should I be in the big city? <eos> You know my money's running out <eos> Cost too much for a hamburger <eos> And they want too much for fries <eos> You better not talk to the big leg woman <eos> 'Cause they want too much for the thigh <eos> I guess I'll go back home, yeah, go back home <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Oh, going home, take it home now <eos> 
Tengo puesto un nacimiento en un rincón de mi casa <eos> Con pastores y pastoras y un palacio en la montaña <eos> Ahí vive el rey Herodes, ahí viven sus soldados <eos> Todos están esperando que lleguen los Reyes Magos <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> En el cielo hay una estrella que a los Reyes Magos guía <eos> Hacia Belén para ver a Dios, hijo de María <eos> Cuando pasan los monarcas sale la gente al camino <eos> Y alegres se van con ellos para ver al tierno niño <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Hacia el portal del Belén se dirige un pastorcito <eos> Cantando de esta manera para alegrar el camino <eos> Ha nacido el Niño Dios en un portal miserable <eos> Para enseñar a los hombres la humildad de su linaje <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana está es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos>

I looked to my arms <eos> And my legs <eos> And my head <eos> And my chest <eos> And I said that I'm okay <eos> No more thoughts of regret <eos> They're purely electrical signals <eos> So I might've flicked a switch <eos> Oh <eos> It's time to relax <eos> Have a snack and <eos> Walk to the river <eos> Noticed how it is bigger than all of this <eos> You were someone <eos> I met on the internet <eos> Not tonight <eos> You are real <eos> What a rush <eos> What a feel <eos> Take you out on a date <eos> And pretend that were making a ten point <eos> Series about our mistakes <eos> Time to relax <eos> Oh we're both kinda lightweight so <eos> We went for dinner <eos> Hanging with you is different to everything <eos> Wow <eos> 
Wrote my whole life down in a notebook <eos> Songs about you and me <eos> I've been singing to every soul in Tennessee <eos> But nobody seems to listen <eos> And no one ever smiles the way that you do <eos> So I guess you'll never hear me on the radio <eos> And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine <eos> To hold you once more <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> I left home for Hollywood looking for a part to play <eos> Well, you always said I had such a pretty face <eos> But I guess I'm not that pretty <eos> 'Cause no one looks at me the way that you do <eos> Well, you'll always be a movie star to me <eos> And darlin', now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> Well, we're stuck here in these hills that they call mountains <eos> But darlin', back home in your arms is right where I want to be <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos>

Haunting spirit, hear these words that I proclaim <eos> I will guide your journey <eos> And you will have your due of flames <eos> Accept my humble sacrifice of the chosen few <eos> Slain and flayed before the pyre <eos> I'll make your wish come true <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> Burnt black by the fires of death <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> The transition through flames into the night <eos> As the fumes rise from the funeral pyre <eos> Oh, immortals hеar my call, I've shorn my hair and lit the pyre <eos> Thе stars shine and the fires cast light on the mournful choir <eos> Winds, I summon you, from the north and from the west <eos> Gather to feed flames, come forth to greet your guest <eos> Blood is shed <eos> The wine is spilled <eos> Bellowing smoke from the tripods <eos> No words unsaid <eos> The deed fulfilled <eos> An offering to the gods <eos> Gathered now the burnt remains <eos> A stark reminder of the pains <eos> On the road to immortality <eos> Where lesser men would die <eos> The rites are ended on the morrow <eos> The bones interred beneath the barrow <eos> Enshrined in gold forever more <eos> Pray Elysium awaits, and the names go on <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> Burnt black by the fires of death <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> The transition through flames into the night <eos> As the fumes rise from the funeral pyre <eos>

Vivo fingiendo un sueño que no se cuenta <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> Pero el amor se escapa, aunque yo te mienta <eos> Yo estaba buscándote, sola aquí esperándote <eos> Y tú, mirándome sin hablar <eos> Y yo, hablándote sin mirar <eos> Y tú, no sé lo que estás sintiendo <eos> Pero yo me estoy muriendo <eos> No aguanto más <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos> El mar de tu piel, quiero navegar <eos> Perderme en las olas contigo <eos> Bailando en las olas contigo <eos> Un barco de papel, te quiero regalar <eos> Para que vengas conmigo <eos> Bailando en las olas conmigo <eos> Y tú, mirándome sin hablar <eos> Y yo, hablándote sin mirar <eos> Y tú, ya sé lo que estás sintiendo <eos> Ya sabes que estoy muriendo <eos> No aguanto más <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos> Cuando bailas brillan las estrellas <eos> Todas se derriten sobre el mar <eos> Espuma sobre el mar <eos> Sigo caminando tras tus huellas <eos> Y aunque se derriten en el mar <eos> Yo te voy a encontrar <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos ésta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos>

Goin' down like a sunset <eos> Burnin' out like a cigarette <eos> Blowin' through the cash, through the past <eos> Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left <eos> I could go on and on <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> I could drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> Trying to ride out the midnight <eos> Trying to fight through the daylight <eos> Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that <eos> I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> 
I wish we could cut all ties with the morning light <eos> Because our secret’s in the dark <eos> And though I don’t take it to heart <eos> I just need more time <eos> To appreciate what we’ll leave behind <eos> Like the feeling when you’re holding me still with your eyes <eos> It’s as real as the stars that freckle the sky <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> And all of the light we’re missing <eos> Thanks to the sun’s indifference <eos> Oh limited time is hard to survive <eos> With no sacrifice <eos> But conversation’s flowing <eos> Further than every ocean <eos> Oh please tell me why <eos> Please tell me why <eos> This feels so right <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Lets just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine, we’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos>

Come on, skinny love, just last the year <eos> Pour a little salt, we were never here <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer <eos> I tell my love to wreck it all <eos> Cut out all the ropes and let me fall <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Right in this moment, this order's tall <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And in the morning I'll be with you <eos> But it will be a different kind <eos> And I'll be holding all the tickets <eos> And you'll be owning all the fines <eos> Come on, skinny love, what happened here? <eos> Suckle on the hope in light brassieres <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Sullen load is full, so slow on the split <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And now all your love is wasted <eos> And then who the hell was I? <eos> And I'm breaking at the britches <eos> And at the end of all your lines <eos> Who will love you? <eos> Who will fight? <eos> Who will fall far behind? <eos> 
I’ve been told to be a seer, one must be ruthless <eos> So, I’ve eaten the yellow text of Paul and Brutus <eos> The soothsayers came and went, now I believe <eos> To be reborn, we first must cultivate a seed <eos> Oh, spit it out <eos> Release that precious piece <eos> Of pebbled ash from your mouth <eos> That’s a working-class jewel <eos> Spinning round your hopeless head <eos> It ain’t for chewing on <eos> It’s for looking through instead <eos> You prefer the common stone to the pearls <eos> Under the plexiglass with the factory girl <eos> Who told her sister all about you <eos> Hanging bedsheets on the clothesline in the sun <eos> She keep you warm, she keep you fed <eos> Now you’ve gone and lost your bed <eos> On the doorstep of the sick and indignant society <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who watched night disown day <eos> 35 days after defection <eos> I am sat in the cheapest of rooms <eos> There’s an oil lamp defiantly snapping at the shadows <eos> I’ve had notions to start playing chess <eos> But the mice, they have stolen the pieces <eos> I have told them to start paying rent or they must leave <eos> I am writing my letters <eos> I am anchored in an arm chair <eos> I intend on shooting the postman <eos> When he passes at dawn <eos> I haven’t eaten for 13 days <eos> I’ve taken the form of a Bosnian beggar <eos> And I’m reason the preachers are screaming and shouting <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who would love to be remembered <eos> By the ghosts of November <eos> On St. Stephens’s Day <eos> In some minuscule way <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> I can’t get out now <eos> So here’s a postcard from Catalonia <eos>

Well, I don’t know what happens when we go <eos> But I hear that the streets are paved in gold <eos> And maybe there’s a little red dirt for my soul <eos> And maybe, just maybe the beer’s still cold <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> Well, I wonder if that light at the end is neon <eos> And I sure hope there’s a barstool for me to be on <eos> Give me Hank, give me Cash, give me Merle, give me Jones <eos> I know where I’m going when I’m home <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> That’s where I’ll be <eos>

As I undressed in my apartment, empty-hearted <eos> Did you remember how we made it without a sound? <eos> And with all the vapor that you brought in <eos> And you never even let me hit the ground <eos> You still never make a sound in the air <eos> But you never made a downpour in the sky <eos> And the window clears as my tears pouring down <eos> We could never rain as one on empty houses <eos> It would downpour back to town with deafening sound <eos> It would clean the insides inside-out <eos> You never made a cloud float in the air <eos> But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile <eos> The time you put has made a wound <eos> It's just a wound it leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> 
Yeah <eos> Never got love from a government man <eos> Heading downstream till the levee give in <eos> What can I do to get the money? <eos> We ain’t got the money, we ain’t getting out <eos> Heading downstream till the levee gives in <eos> And my dreams are wearing thin <eos> All I need’s relief <eos> I need, I need some sympathy, yeah <eos> Look at me <eos> I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me <eos> We could never get free <eos> I just wanna be (I just wanna be) <eos> Look at me <eos> I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me <eos> We could never get free <eos> I just wanna be <eos> I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream) <eos> All of my life been wading in <eos> Water so deep, now we got to swim <eos> Wonder will it ever end <eos> How long, how long 'til we have a friend? <eos> Coming down, feeling like a battery hen <eos> Waves won’t break 'til the tide comes in <eos> What will I do in the sunrise? <eos> What will I do without my dreams? (Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh, hey) <eos> Look at me <eos> I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me <eos> We could never get free <eos> I just wanna be (I just wanna be) <eos> Look at me <eos> I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me <eos> We could never get free <eos> I just wanna be <eos> I just wanna dream (Dream, dream, dream) <eos> We’re all together in the same boat <eos> I know you, you know me <eos> Baby, you know me <eos> We’re all together in the same boat <eos> I know you, you know me <eos> Baby, you know me <eos> We’re all together in the same boat <eos> (Look at me <eos> I just can’t believe what they’ve done to me <eos> We could never get free <eos> I just wanna be) <eos> I know you, you know me <eos> Baby <eos> I just wanna dream <eos> I just wanna dream <eos> I just wanna dream <eos> Baby, you know me <eos> 
In this hole that is me <eos> The dead are rolling over <eos> In this hole, thickening <eos> Dirt shoveled over shoulders <eos> I feel it in me, so overwhelmed <eos> Oh, this pressured center rising <eos> My life overturned, unfair the despair <eos> All these scars keep ripping open <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> In this hole that is me <eos> A life that's growing feeble <eos> In this hole, so limiting <eos> The sun has set, all darkens <eos> Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel <eos> Internal path-way to contention <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Are you happy? <eos> Are you happy? <eos> Are you feeling <eos> Happy? <eos> In this hole that is me <eos> Left with a heart exhausted <eos> What's my release? What sets me free? <eos> Do you pull me up just to push me down again? <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> (Peel me from the skin) <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear me from the bone <eos> (Tear me from the bone) <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Does it make you happy? <eos> Are you feeling happy <eos> Are you fucking happy <eos> Now that I'm lost, left with nothing? <eos> Does it make you happy? <eos> Are you feeling happy? <eos> Are you fucking happy <eos> Now that I'm lost, left with nothing? <eos> 
Sweet disposition <eos> Never too soon <eos> Oh, reckless abandon <eos> Like no one's watching you <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> So stay there <eos> 'Cause I'll be coming over <eos> And while our blood's still young <eos> It's so young, it runs <eos> And won't stop 'til it's over <eos> Won't stop to surrender <eos> Songs of desperation <eos> I played them for you <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> So stay there <eos> 'Cause I'll be coming over <eos> And while our blood's still young <eos> It's so young, it runs <eos> And won't stop 'til it's over <eos> Won't stop to surrender <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs <eos> Won't stop 'til it's over <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs <eos> Won't stop 'til it's over <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs <eos> Won't stop 'til it's over <eos> A moment, a love, a dream aloud <eos> A moment, a love, a moment, a love <eos> Won't stop to surrender <eos> 
What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone now? <eos> Are you? <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> 
Yeah <eos> We're stuck in the same old standstill again <eos> Sick of waiting for you to feel it <eos> Always waiting for the next breakdown to begin <eos> Scared of getting too complicated <eos> What a shame (What a shame) <eos> Hiding in your shell again <eos> Bitter, fucked out of better days and missed opportunities <eos> I don't wanna hear that the times are changing <eos> I'm the same as I've always been <eos> Why can't you see? Are you even listening to me? <eos> I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become <eos> Get in or get out, I don't care, but don't waste my time <eos> Stand by my side or you can move on with your life <eos> Burnt out, enslaved, I'm left carry a weight that has me <eos> Worn down, in doubt, I'm left to drown with no oxygen <eos> Burnt out, drain me until there's nothing left to bleed <eos> Burdened by the chains and too exhausted to run away <eos> I gave you everything <eos> You spit it back in my face <eos> It never meant anything <eos> Left me to swallow the pain <eos> So much for the dream <eos> What a shame (What a shame) <eos> Hiding in your shell again <eos> Bitter, fucked out of better days and missed opportunities <eos> I don't wanna hear that the times are changing <eos> I'm the same as I've always been <eos> Why can't you see? Are you even listening to me? <eos> I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become <eos> Get in or get out, I don't care, but don't waste my time <eos> Stand by my side or you can move on with your life <eos> You took what you could just to throw me away <eos> I gave you everything <eos> So much for the dream <eos> I gave you everything <eos> 
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño <eos> When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino <eos> As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name <eos> Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came <eos> I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school <eos> Never going, never showing up when we had to <eos> Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave <eos> I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall <eos> But what would you expect with a conscience so small? <eos> Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised <eos> Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised <eos> 'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and <eos> Cutting people down is just a minor offense then <eos> It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn <eos> I'm sick of being told to wait my turn <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Don't count on me to let you know when <eos> Don't count on me, I'll do it again <eos> Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing <eos> Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening <eos> Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat <eos> Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing <eos> You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin <eos> But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing <eos> 'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook <eos> You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book <eos> I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion <eos> The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Casualty of society <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Victim of your conformity and back down <eos>

Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Esto que siento me supera y no lo aguanto <eos> Sin ti los días pasan sin su encanto <eos> No tengo nada en mi defensa, sabes que no soy un santo <eos> Pero si me lo preguntas, quizá no era para tanto <eos> Yo dando potes <eos> Gritando tu nombre con fuerza pa' que lo notes <eos> Camino donde caminas esperando que te topes <eos> Soñando que me llamas y voy a todo galope <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la nochе ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienеs, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la noche ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienes, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Te quise más de lo que tú me quisiste <eos> Inestable desde que te fuiste y muy triste <eos> Mi consciencia dice: "¿Acaso enloqueciste?" <eos> Y yo no sé qué decirle, me tiembla la voz <eos> Ya no veo tu luz <eos> Ahora estás lejos, ya no hay plenitud <eos> ¿Ahora cómo le haré pa' agarrar altitud? <eos> Me haces falta, no hay como tú, auh <eos> Me acostumbré a no estar solo, uh, uh <eos> Ando ansioso y no lo controlo, uh-uh-uh, uh <eos> Estoy consciente de toda la razón que había en la gente <eos> Te doy tu despedida, mi amor, un beso en la frente <eos> Lo mío por ti seguirá latente <eos> Detente, permíteme mirarte bien, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> 
Maybe we could make it all right <eos> We could make it better sometime <eos> Maybe we could make it happen, baby <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> Just a little, little bit better <eos> Good enough to waste some time <eos> Tell me, would it make you happy, baby <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> 
Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> At the Christmas party hop <eos> Mistletoe hung where you can see <eos> Everybody tries to stop <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Let the Christmas spirit ring <eos> Later we'll have some pumpkin pie <eos> And we'll do some caroling <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with bows of holly <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashion way <eos> (This song shares with Jingle Bell Rock so…) <eos> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring <eos> Snowing and blowing, have bushels of fun <eos> That's the jingle bell rock, rock, rock <eos> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <eos> Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square <eos> In the frosty air <eos> What a bright time, it's the right time <eos> To rock the night away <eos> Jingle bell time is a swell time <eos> To go gliding in a one horse sleigh <eos> Giddiup jingle horse, pick up your feet <eos> Jingle around the clock <eos> Mix and mingle in the jingling beat <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> Mix and mingle in the jingling beat <eos> That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> 
Juntos, la inmensidad <eos> Un mundo, nuestra casa chica, el tiempo no importa porque <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos para inventar <eos> A no aburrirnos <eos> Desafiar las horas de un futuro incierto <eos> Que solo nos sirve <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Coro: <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Nos juramos juntos que aunque la vida pase <eos> Los rios corran y los pajaros emigren <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Basta que te mire <eos> Basta que te roce <eos> Bastan nuestros cuerpos humedos y tibios <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos la eternidad <eos> Dos soledades <eos> Un iman perfecto <eos> Casi el egoismo <eos> Solo para amarnos <eos> Para amarnos mas... <eos> Coro... <eos>

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah <eos> Rooftop dripping, thundering, yeah <eos> Bless my soul 'n' my skin, mhm <eos> Trace the shape that you’re in <eos> Watching this storm rise <eos> Make me feel a way <eos> If the clouds don’t burn <eos> And the sunlight fades <eos> And the rain comes down <eos> All over LA then <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> When the wind moves high <eos> And the leaves give chase <eos> We can close our eyes <eos> Feel the windows shaking <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay here? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> Pour our hearts out daily, yeah <eos> Pushing, pulling, changing, yeah <eos> Filling me up from vacant <eos> We were born for the wild <eos> You make me feel that way <eos> If the clouds don’t burn <eos> And the sunlight fades <eos> And the rain comes down <eos> All over LA then <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> When the wind moves high <eos> And the leaves give chase <eos> We can close our eyes <eos> Feel the windows shaking <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay here? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> Something 'bout you keeps hitting me harder (Something 'bout you keeps hitting me harder) <eos> Maybe that work can wait a little longer (Just a little bit) <eos> Breath it all in, baby, we belong here, yeah <eos> Watching this storm rise <eos> Make me feel a way, yeah <eos> If the clouds don’t burn <eos> And the sunlight fades <eos> And the rain comes down <eos> All over LA then <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> When the wind moves high <eos> And the leaves give chase <eos> We can close our eyes <eos> Feel the windows shaking <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> Why don’t you stay? <eos> 
To see age in a flower <eos> The dawns are speeding up <eos> You know it’ll hurt you <eos> Feel all of a sudden <eos> Tired and teary-eyed <eos> You knew it’d kill you <eos> Don’t wear a tie that’ll choke you <eos> To death in the city <eos> Take it off and forget <eos> Spare the fret that’ll make you <eos> Miss all of summer <eos> Sweat it out and forgive <eos> To see loss in a shower <eos> The petals turn to mush <eos> It still disappoints you <eos> Then less of a sudden <eos> You wire your weary mind <eos> To let it deceive you <eos> Don’t force a smile that’ll make you <eos> Resent the city <eos> Play it soft and forgive <eos> Keep the frown that’ll make you <eos> Squint in the summer <eos> Play it slow and forget <eos> 
Ese amor llega así de ésta manera <eos> No tiene la culpa <eos> Caballo de danza vana <eos> Porque es muy despreciado por eso <eos> No te perdono llorar <eos> Ese amor llega asi esta manera <eos> No tiene la culpa <eos> Amor de compra y venta <eos> Amor de en el pasado <eos> Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem <eos> Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> No tienes perdón de Dios <eos> Tu eres mi vida la fortuna del destino <eos> En el destino del desamparado <eos> Lo mísmo ya que ayer <eos> Lo mísmo soy yo <eos> No te encuentro l'abandon <eos> Eres imposible no te encuentro de verdad <eos> Por eso un dia no encuentro si de nada <eos> Lo mísmo ya que ayer <eos> Lo pienso en ti <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi <eos> Bamboleo bambolea <eos> Porque mi vida yo la prefiero vivir asi! <eos>

Vosotras, las familiares <eos> Inevitables golosas; <eos> Vosotras mosca vulgares <eos> Me evocais todas las cosas <eos> Oh viejas moscas voraces <eos> Como abejas en abril <eos> Viejas moscas pertinaces <eos> Sobre mi calva infantil <eos> Moscas de todas las horas <eos> De infancia y adolescencia <eos> De mi juventud dorada; <eos> De esta segunda inocencia <eos> Que da en no creer en nada, en nada <eos> Moscas del primer hastío <eos> En el salón familiar <eos> Las claras tardes de estío <eos> En que yo empece a soñar! <eos> Y en la aborrecida escuela <eos> Raudas mosca divertidas <eos> Perseguidas, perseguidas <eos> Por amor de lo vuela <eos> Yo se que os habeis posado <eos> Sobre el juguete encantado <eos> Sobre el librote cerrado <eos> Sobre las cartas de amor <eos> Sobre los párpados yertos <eos> De los muertos <eos> Inevitables golosas <eos> Que ni labrais como abejas <eos> Ni brillais cual mariposas <eos> Pequeñitas, revoltosas <eos> Vosotras, amigas viejas <eos> Me evocais todas las cosas <eos> 
I met you in a bathroom stall <eos> Kissing  up against the wall <eos> Thinking  it was love right there, right then <eos> And I don't want this night to end <eos> Why'd you have to make me fall <eos> Right  before the final call? <eos> Hoping  you will tell me where and when <eos> 'Cause I just wanna do it again <eos> What  if this is not just for the night - the night, baby? <eos> Say the word and I'd be down for life <eos> For life <eos> I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've  got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Is it love? <eos> I'm just tryinna make it last <eos> Throwing back another glass <eos> I ain't never felt a rush like that <eos> You make me wanna move too fast <eos> Fall for the way we dance <eos> A little bit of man on man, yeah <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> But I just wanna do it again <eos> What if this is not just for the night - the night, baby? <eos> Say the word and I'd be down for life <eos> For life <eos> I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> Or maybe just not enough <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> Or maybe just not enough <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> And I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> 
Find your feet <eos> Don't look down <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> We can't climb <eos> If we're intertwined <eos> Oh, I never would have thought we were holding on <eos> For too long <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Trust these words <eos> Though I get a little tongue-tied sometimes <eos> We're worth <eos> More than I ever could know <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> And you might just say that you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me 'cos we can't see <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> Like the first time and now I leave <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me again <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos>

Leave me out with the waste <eos> This is not what I do <eos> It's the wrong kind of place <eos> To be thinking of you <eos> It's the wrong time <eos> For somebody new <eos> It's a small crime <eos> And I got no excuse <eos> And is that all right, yeah? <eos> Give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> That all right, yeah? <eos> If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it? <eos> That all right, yeah? <eos> Give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> That all right, yeah, with you? <eos> Leave me out with the waste <eos> This is not what I do <eos> It's the wrong kind of place <eos> To be cheating on you <eos> It's the wrong time <eos> She's pulling me through <eos> It's a small crime <eos> And I got no excuse <eos> And is that all right, yeah? <eos> To give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it? <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> If I give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right? <eos> That all right with you? <eos> That all right, yeah? <eos> If I give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it? <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> If I give my gun away when it's loaded <eos> (Is that all right with you?) <eos> Is that all right? <eos> Is that all right with you? <eos> And is that all right, yeah? <eos> (To give my gun away when it's loaded) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> (You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?) <eos> Is that all right, yeah? <eos> (To give my gun away when it's loaded) <eos> Is that all right?

There ain’t nothing more depressing than a pine tree <eos> Gussied up with candy canes and balls <eos> Those carollers have kept me up for hours <eos> "It’s Merry Christmas" — seeping through my walls <eos> Now, I’m no wiccan commie nut or nothing <eos> But there’s one damn holiday that I can’t stand <eos> It ain’t Halloween, or Thanksgiving, or even April Fools <eos> But it’ll surely make a fool out of every man <eos> Ha! <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> You know where to stick those jingle bells <eos> If I ain’t hammered, it ain’t Hanukkah <eos> And all you motherfuckers go to hell <eos> If I ain’t cock-eyed, it ain’t Kwanzaa <eos> Joy to the world of Jack & Cokes <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> ‘Cuz I ain’t ever anything but broke <eos> Now, every year the malls are just a madhouse <eos> Full of empty pockets, thoughts and smiles <eos> Just the smell of eggnog makes me vomit <eos> And those colored lights are fucking infantile <eos> I think, we collectively as a people <eos> Should rise against this corporate jolly noise <eos> And tell the world: "Let’s buy some peace and quiet for a change <eos> Before we spend it all on fucking toys!" <eos> Ha! <eos> So, if I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> You know where to stick those jingle bells <eos> If I ain’t hammered, it ain’t Hanukkah <eos> Fa-la-la-la-la, go fuck yourself <eos> If I ain’t cock-eyed, it ain’t Kwanzaa <eos> Joy to the world of getting stoned <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> So leave this goddamn Scrooge the fuck alone <eos> Merry Fucking Christmas <eos> 
Once in royal David's city <eos> Stood a lowly cattle shed <eos> Where a mother laid her Baby <eos> In a manger for His bed: <eos> Mary was that mother mild <eos> Jesus Christ her little Child <eos> He came down to earth from heaven <eos> Who is God and Lord of all <eos> And His shelter was a stable <eos> And His cradle was a stall; <eos> With the poor, and mean, and lowly <eos> Lived on earth our Saviour holy <eos> And our eyes at last shall see Him <eos> Through His own redeeming love; <eos> For that Child so dear and gentle <eos> Is our Lord in heaven above <eos> And He leads His children on <eos> To the place where He is gone <eos> Not in that poor lowly stable <eos> With the oxen standing by <eos> We shall see Him; but in heaven <eos> Set at God's right hand on high; <eos> When like stars His children crowned <eos> All in white shall wait around <eos>

Colgados, enamorados <eos> Aqui estamos como dos perros sin dueño <eos> Esta noche es imposible tener sueño <eos> Seguro, pegados <eos> En plena calle <eos> Parecemos como dos recien casados <eos> Cuando todos los amigos se han largado <eos> Cansados <eos> (coro) <eos> Completamente enamorados <eos> Alucinando con nosotros dos <eos> Sintiendo morbo por primera vez <eos> Y por primera vez tocandonos <eos> Completamente enamorados <eos> Como borrachos yo no se de que <eos> Entre las sombras de los arboles <eos> Nos desvestimos para amarnos bien <eos> Para amarnos bien(4) <eos> Compenetrados, estamos enamorados <eos> Matados de tanta risa <eos> Con la luna resbalando por la espalda <eos> Tu te pones mi camisa yo tu falda <eos> Felices <eos> (coro) <eos> Para amarnos bien(4) <eos> Compenetrados, estamos enamorados <eos> (coro) <eos>

Contemplating what's gonna be <eos> Wondering which way to turn <eos> Lotta things left to be learned <eos> Complicating silly old me <eos> The things I hold on to <eos> Just let it go & see what it do <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we want to see <eos> Just what we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> Fantasizing having myself a ball <eos> Staring up at the big screen <eos> Problem is I'm the only one <eos> Who's seen it <eos> Realizing it's not like that at all <eos> Time to come down to Earth <eos> & feel what it's really worth <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we wanna see <eos> Just want we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos>

Who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> And who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> Who can say why your heart sighs <eos> As your love flies? Only time <eos> And who can say why your heart cries <eos> When your love lies? Only time <eos> Who can say when the roads meet? <eos> That love might be in your heart? <eos> And who can say when the day sleeps <eos> If the night keeps all your heart? <eos> Night keeps all your heart <eos> Who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> And who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos>

Cuando te veo así <eos> Tengo que sentarme <eos> Tengo que pensar en mis palabras <eos> Cuando te veo así <eos> Quiero abrazarte, piernas por delante <eos> Cabeza en tu cama <eos> Cuando te veo así <eos> Superficies cambian <eos> Las estrellas manchan ojos como llamas <eos> Cuando te veo así <eos> Colores levantan <eos> Cada movimiento de tu dulce espalda <eos> Ayayai <eos> Ayayai <eos> Ayayai <eos> Ayayai <eos> Es mi respiración <eos> Hecha de luna <eos> Vientos en dirección <eos> Pa' tu cintura <eos> Cambio de perspectiva <eos> Cuerpo de pluma <eos> Volando por el cuarto <eos> Pa'l cielo corre llanto <eos> Digo <eos> Y dices <eos> Y digo <eos> Ayayai <eos> Y dices tú <eos> Ayayai <eos> Digo <eos> Y dices <eos> Y digo <eos> Ayayai <eos> Y dices tú <eos> Ayayai <eos> 
I sat by the ocean <eos> And drank a potion, baby, to erase you <eos> Face down in the boulevard <eos> Yet, I couldn't face you <eos> There ain't no use in crying <eos> It doesn't change anything <eos> So, baby, what good does it do? <eos> Your friends, they all sympathize <eos> Maybe I don’t need them to <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead, I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> There's nowhere to run away <eos> Said, "Boy, if you want love <eos> You'll have to go and find it with someone new <eos> Do you know who you really are <eos> Are you sure it's really you?" <eos> Lies are a funny thing <eos> They slip through your fingertips <eos> Because they never happened to you <eos> Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> Into the light, left with nowhere to hide <eos> Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night <eos> 
When they ask to go away with me <eos> I say the music is art, I'm ready to go <eos> Feel the bass in my heart like <eos> In my heart like <eos> Bass in my heart like <eos> I'm startin' to feel it, do you feel it too? <eos> I think that I like it, I think I like you <eos> I'm startin' to fly, this beat is like a magic carpet <eos> It's bringin' me higher <eos> I'm lovin' that this makes me free <eos> I'm hopin' that this never leaves <eos> When they ask to go away with me <eos> I say the music is art, I'm ready to go <eos> Feel the bass in my heart like <eos> In my heart like <eos> Bass in my heart like <eos> I'm startin' to feel it, do you feel it too? <eos> I think that I like it, I think I like you <eos> I'm startin' to fly, this beat is like a magic carpet <eos> It's bringin' me higher <eos> I'm startin' to feel it, do you feel it too? <eos> I think that I like it, I think I like you <eos> I'm startin' to fly, this beat is like a magic carpet <eos> It's bringin' me higher <eos> I'm lovin' that this makes me free <eos> I'm hopin' that this never leaves <eos> When they ask to go away with me <eos> I say the music is art, I'm ready to go <eos> Feel the bass in my heart like <eos> In my heart like <eos> Bass in my heart like <eos> When they ask to go away with me <eos> I say the music is art, I'm ready to go <eos> Feel the bass in my heart like <eos> 
Spinning around, spinning around <eos> Oh <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed <eos> From back in the day <eos> Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe <eos> I got something to say <eos> I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back <eos> The future will be <eos> And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction <eos> And it leads back to me? <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength <eos> To really believe <eos> And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it <eos> 'Cause it's gotta be real <eos> I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight <eos> 'Cause the truth's given me <eos> A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire <eos> Do you like what you see? <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh) <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> You know you like it like this <eos> Oh, baby, baby, baby <eos> You know you like it like this <eos> Oh, baby, baby, baby <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down (I'm not the same) <eos> I'm not the same (I know you feel me) <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> Feel me 'cause you like it like this, oh <eos> I'm not the same <eos> I know you like it like this, oh <eos> Ooh yeah, like it like this, like it like this <eos> I'm not the same, like it like this <eos> I'm not the same, I'm not the same, oh <eos> 
There's a stranger in my bed <eos> There's a pounding in my head <eos> Glitter all over the room <eos> Pink flamingos in the pool <eos> I smell like a minibar <eos> DJ's passed out in the yard <eos> Barbies on the barbeque <eos> This a hickey or a bruise? <eos> Pictures of last night ended up online <eos> I'm screwed, oh well <eos> It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled <eos> Damn <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> Trying to connect the dots <eos> Don't know what to tell my boss <eos> Think the city towed my car <eos> Chandelier is on the floor <eos> Ripped my favorite party dress <eos> Warrant's out for my arrest <eos> Think I need a ginger ale <eos> That was such an epic fail <eos> Pictures of last night ended up online <eos> I'm screwed, oh well <eos> It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled <eos> Damn <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again) <eos> This Friday night, do it all again <eos> (Do it all again) This Friday night <eos> T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F <eos> T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> 
It's been awhile, since I could, hold my head high <eos> And it's been awhile, since I first saw you <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could call you <eos> But everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem <eos> The consequences that I've rendered <eos> I've stretched myself beyond my means <eos> It's been awhile, since I could say, that I wasn't addicted <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could say I love myself as well <eos> And it's been awhile, since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do <eos> And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you <eos> And everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem <eos> The consequences that I've rendered <eos> I've gone and fucked things up again <eos> Why must I feel this way? <eos> Just make this go away <eos> Just one more peaceful day <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could, look at myself straight <eos> And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry <eos> And it's been awhile, since I've seen the way the candles light your face <eos> And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste <eos> But everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem to be... and I know it's me <eos> I cannot blame this on my father <eos> He did the best he could for me <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could, hold my head up high <eos> And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry <eos> 
Les matins se suivent et se ressemblent <eos> Quand l'amour fait place au quotidien <eos> On n'était pas fait pour vivre ensemble <eos> Ça n'suffit pas toujours de s'aimer bien <eos> C'est drôle, hier, on s'ennuyait <eos> Et c'est à peine si l'on trouvait <eos> Des mots pour se parler du mauvais temps <eos> Et maintenant qu'il faut partir <eos> On a cent mille choses à dire <eos> Qui tiennent trop à cœur pour si peu de temps <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos> On fait c'qu'il faut, on tient nos rôles <eos> On se regarde, on rit, on crâne un peu <eos> On a toujours oublié quelque chose <eos> C'est pas facile de se dire adieu <eos> Et l'on sait trop bien que tôt ou tard <eos> Demain peut-être ou même ce soir <eos> On va se dire que tout n'est pas perdu <eos> De ce roman inachevé, on va se faire un conte de fées <eos> Mais on a passé l'âge, on n'y croirait plus <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos> Roméo, Juliette et tous les autres <eos> Au fond de vos bouquins dormez en paix <eos> Une simple histoire comme la nôtre <eos> Est de celles qu'on écrira jamais <eos> Allons petite il faut partir <eos> Laisser ici nos souvenirs <eos> On va descendre ensemble si tu veux <eos> Et quand elle va nous voir passer <eos> La patronne du café <eos> Va encore nous dire "Salut les amoureux" <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos>

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night <eos> And wouldn't you love to love her? <eos> Takes to the sky like a bird in flight <eos> And who will be her lover? <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> She is like a cat in the dark <eos> And then she is the darkness <eos> She rules her life like a fine skylark <eos> And when the sky is starless <eos> Once in a million years a lady like her rises <eos> Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone <eos> Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> She rings like a bell through the night <eos> And wouldn't you love to love her? <eos> She rules her life like a bird in flight <eos> And who will be her lover? <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Dreams unwind <eos> Love's a state of mind <eos> Dreams unwind <eos> Love's a state of mind <eos> 
What if I were smiling? <eos> And falling into your arms? <eos> Would you see then? <eos> What I can see now? <eos> Tell me about the old days <eos> Us against December skies <eos> I've spent my happiest days here <eos> Carry me forever in your heart <eos> Now I'm standing here alone <eos> In the street where we once met <eos> I am sadder than I've ever been <eos> But still glad you're doing well <eos> And I hope even when I'm gone <eos> Your smile will never lеave your face <eos> And I am sadder than I'vе ever been <eos> But still glad you're doing well <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut your name into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut our names into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> And so I smiled at you <eos> If I never shed a tear for you <eos> Cause alone from the heart <eos> You can touch the sky <eos> Don't think of me too often <eos> I don't want you to get sad <eos> I think I'll miss you forever <eos> Like the sun the stars in the morning skies <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut your name into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut our names into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> What if I were smiling? <eos> And falling into your arms? <eos> Would you see then? <eos> What I can see now? <eos> So, this was us my dear <eos> Us against December skies <eos> I've spent my happiest days here <eos> Carry us forever in your heart <eos> 
There's nothing weirder than to wake up with my enemy <eos> Despite I know that I was wrong <eos> I take the thought and push it away <eos> I don't believe that the fact I never learn <eos> I never change, won't have a downside for me <eos> I'm immortal, I'll be ok <eos> But what comes up must come down, that's what they say, what they say <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I'm hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> I can't help it, I'm such a slave <eos> There is something in my veins I can't contain <eos> When will I learn to behave? <eos> So just fuck it, let's play the game <eos> Let's enjoy the ride, we all die all the same <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I'm hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I’m hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> 
A million miles away <eos> Your signal in the distance <eos> To whom it may concern <eos> I think I lost my way <eos> Gettin' good at startin' over <eos> Every time that I return <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> Do you remember the days <eos> We built these paper mountains <eos> Then sat and watched them burn? <eos> I think I found my place <eos> Can't you feel it growin' stronger? <eos> Little conquerors <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> Now <eos> For the very first time <eos> Don't you pay no mind <eos> Set me free again <eos> To keep alive a moment at a time <eos> But still inside a whisper to a riot <eos> To sacrifice but knowin' to survive <eos> The first to climb another state of mind <eos> I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign <eos> Forever, whenever, I never want to die <eos> I never want to die, I never want to die <eos> I'm on my knees, I never want to die <eos> I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire <eos> Forever, whenever, I never want to die <eos> I never want to leave, I never say goodbye <eos> Forever, whenever, forever, whenever <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos>

Mercy like a gun when you’ve come undone <eos> I’ve awoken in the hour that receives no one <eos> The sound of a tribe will shake me out until sunrise <eos> The heat of tomorrow released as the wind blows <eos> A beating stare from all the tribe <eos> No sleep tonight <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Stripped of all the air in my lungs now <eos> Flee from the walls <eos> So alone <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Raise me up in my throes <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Upon the burial lie thieves of their past <eos> Firewater <eos> Tenacious <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Between the living and the dead we move <eos> Between the living and the dead we all move <eos> Shift all placement, but they’re sifting you <eos> Between the living and the dead we all move <eos> The claim we stake <eos> A land within our wake <eos> A garden in the bones <eos> A headdress down in the soil we own <eos> We build it on the bullshit or build it upon the burial <eos> A garden in the bones <eos> A headdress down in the soil we own, yeah <eos> Stripped of all the air in my lungs now <eos> Feeling so alone <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Feeling so low <eos> Pull out all the ground from below <eos> You’ve given quite a show <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Raise me up in my throes <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Upon the burial lie thieves of their past <eos> Firewater <eos> Tenacious <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Between the living and the dead we move (We move) <eos> Mercy like a gun <eos> 
We don't know what we’re made of <eos> The same thing we're afraid of might improve us <eos> Stay up all night, just lay up <eos> Use half of this pay stub to make moves with <eos> Or all of it, of course <eos> And it ain't no room in Paris <eos> We could still fly high, then crash here <eos> Just make sure you pass it <eos> No, you can’t imagine <eos> Ooh, it's automatic <eos> The life we live is lavish <eos> We don't have to be here if we stay <eos> We don't have to leave if we go <eos> Roll some mo' <eos> And we ain't too high if we see eye to eye <eos> Know you feel the rush from a simple touch <eos> Baby, roll some mo' <eos> Through some kissin', lifted up through your vision <eos> Got me on my knees, you’re my religion <eos> Speak in tongues all on your body, no one’s listenin' <eos> Tap out on you, that’s a submission, know you give in <eos> Can't let no time go wasted <eos> This moment can't replace it <eos> Sittin' around so lazy <eos> Comfortably, we’ll fade away <eos> And it ain't no room in Paris <eos> We could still fly high, then crash here <eos> Just make sure you pass it <eos> No, you can't imagine <eos> Ooh, it's automatic <eos> The life we live is lavish <eos> We don't have to be here if we stay <eos> We don't have to leave if we go <eos> Roll some mo' <eos> And we ain't too high if we see eye to eye <eos> Know you feel the rush from a simple touch <eos> Baby, roll some mo' <eos>

Alas my love you do me wrong <eos> To cast me out discourteously <eos> When I have loved you so so long <eos> Delighting in your company <eos> Your gown was of the grassy green <eos> Your sleeves of satin were hanging by <eos> Which made you be a harvest queen <eos> Yet you would not love me <eos> Green sleeves was my all my joy <eos> Green sleeves was my delight <eos> Green sleeves was my heart of gold <eos> And who but my lady green sleeves <eos> Alas my love you do me wrong <eos> To cast me out discourteously <eos> When I have loved you so so long <eos> Delighting in your company <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos> 
Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say <eos> Just like children sleeping we can dream this night away <eos> But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the night <eos> We go where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> When we were strangers I watched you from afar <eos> When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart <eos> But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high <eos> I want to celebrate see it shining in the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> 
My thoughts awake <eos> When dark shadows swallow my eyes <eos> Then I grasp you <eos> Out of me and listen <eos> To the breath of your step in me <eos> Your image is so much closer <eos> As it rips my nights <eos> And scattered by days <eos> It returns into my silence <eos> I gather you in me <eos> And begin to understand <eos> Be my playground of intimacy <eos> Voilence of endearment <eos> You have to inhale if you want to breath <eos> Tired views fall down <eos> Soft bounce without sound <eos> Blurring colours of shattering brains <eos> Warm salivation <eos> Shuttered expression <eos> The aromatic shades of darkness <eos> A red breath whispers in the rivers <eos> The screaming of drowning tongues <eos> A black breath whispers in your bloodlines <eos> You have to inhale <eos> If you want to breath <eos> 
You take a mortal man <eos> And put him in control <eos> Watch him become a god <eos> Watch people's heads a'roll <eos> A'roll, a'roll... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos> Actin' like a robot <eos> Its metal brain corrodes <eos> You try to take its pulse <eos> Before the head explodes <eos> Explodes, explodes... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos> The Earth starts to rumble <eos> World powers fall <eos> A'warring for the heavens <eos> A peaceful man stands tall <eos> A'tall, a'tall... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos>

Games, changes and fears <eos> When will they go from here? <eos> When will they stop? <eos> I believe that fate has brought us here <eos> And we should be together, babe <eos> But we're not <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> I may appear to be free <eos> But I'm just a prisoner of your love <eos> And I may seem alright and smile when you leave <eos> But my smiles are just a front <eos> Just a front, hey! <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Here is my confession <eos> May I be your possession? <eos> Boy, I need your touch <eos> Your love, kisses, and such <eos> With all my might, I try <eos> But this I can't deny <eos> Deny <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> (But I'm dreaming of you, babe) <eos> I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble (Oh!) <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble (Hey, yeah, yeah!) <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear (Sick of love) <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near (Love, your love, kisses ends) <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Goodbye and I choke, yeah) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos>

Dime si llegué a tiempo para la rumba <eos> Hoy traigo aquí un cantar para el bembé <eos> Y también traigo un saco de alegría <eos> Para que se inspire todo aquél que no lo esté Que suene el quinto, clave y timbal con la tumbadora <eos> Pues tengo ganas de bailar y echar un pie <eos> Tan sólo quiero que cuando yo cante, bailen <eos> Y que bailen todos con la punta del pie (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Bailalo rico, María, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> No me digas que tú no fuiste a la rumba, si yo te avisé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Con la punta, con la punta, con la punta, con el peroné <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Y si quieres guarachar, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Y vente a la fiesta, mulata, que yo te enseñé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Es que si yo llego a saber que Perico era sordo, yo paro el tren <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Con la punta, con la punta, con la punta suave <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Para que puedas guarachar conmigo, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Dale movimiento a la cintura, como te enseñé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Es que te busqué por Jesús María y no te encontré <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Bailalo rico, mi gente, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Recuérdalo siempre, mulata, con la punta suave <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Están tocando la gloria, pa´que baile usted <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) (Bailen) <eos> 
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true <eos> Or is he holding you the way I do? <eos> Though love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know <eos> Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go? <eos> You can't say the words I want to hear <eos> While you're with another man <eos> Do you want me, answer yes or no <eos> Darling, I will understand <eos> Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> 
Just a small-town girl <eos> Livin' in a lonely world <eos> She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> Just a city boy <eos> Born and raised in South Detroit <eos> He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> A singer in a smoky room <eos> The smell of wine and cheap perfume <eos> For a smile, they can share the night <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Workin' hard to get my fill <eos> Everybody wants a thrill <eos> Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time <eos> Some will win, some will lose <eos> Some are born to sing the blues <eos> Oh, the movie never ends <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos>

Si por cosas del destino <eos> Un día tú y yo nos despedimos <eos> Ay, yo no sé qué comería <eos> O de qué me reiría <eos> Porque el mundo sin ti no me lo imagino <eos> Si por cosas de la vida <eos> Llega el hombre que por fin te merecías <eos> Y si él es tu alma gemela <eos> Yo me quito aunque me duela <eos> Y hasta dos o tres consejos le daría <eos> No te preocupes por mí <eos> Yo me las arreglaría <eos> Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía <eos> Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti <eos> Y aunque te den el doble de caricias <eos> Y el triple de los besos que te di <eos> Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día <eos> Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti <eos> Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero <eos> Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos> No te preocupes por mí <eos> Yo me las arreglaría <eos> Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía <eos> Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti <eos> Y aunque te den el doble de caricias <eos> Y el triple de los besos que te di <eos> Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día <eos> Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti <eos> Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero <eos> Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos>

I feel like a bird with broken wings <eos> I can't fly back up in the trees <eos> Or like a addict fiendin' for crack <eos> Tryin' to break the habit, but it keep on comin' back <eos> Or like a child cryin' all night long <eos> Hungry for some food, but it's all gone <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> I feel like I'm lost and can't be found <eos> A boat with a hole that's slowly sinkin' down <eos> Or like a bully that put me to the test <eos> Got me paranoid and I can't get no rest <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos>

I'm a-gonna raise a fuss <eos> I'm a-gonna raise a holler <eos> About workin' all summer <eos> Just-a trying to earn a dollar <eos> Every time I call my baby <eos> Try to get a date <eos> My boss says "No dice, son <eos> You gotta work late" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos> Well my mama and papa told me <eos> "Son, you gotta make some money <eos> If you wanna use the car <eos> To go a-ridin' next Sunday" <eos> Well, I didn't go to work <eos> Told the boss I was sick <eos> "You can't use the car <eos> Cause you didn't work a lick" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos> I'm gonna take two weeks <eos> Gonna have a fine vacation <eos> I'm gonna take my problem <eos> To the United Nations <eos> Well, I called my congressman <eos> And he said, quote: <eos> "I'd like to help you, son <eos> But you're too young to vote" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos> 
I guess I'm going through a phase <eos> I'm feeling kinda low <eos> I never leave the house but I'm not home <eos> Can't tell if I'm awake, or living in a dream <eos> A caterpillar drifting down a stream <eos> And I just wanna fly away <eos> But I can't seem to get my feet up off the ground <eos> Everything is turning upside down <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Going through a chrysalis (Oh yeah) <eos> Don't you ever wonder why, wonder why <eos> We've been going through all this <eos> Maybe there's a cocoon around the world <eos> And we're all dying just to break through <eos> 'Cause we'll be butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> La la la la <eos> My consciousness is just a state of mind <eos> I meditate to metamorphosize <eos> I needed change, I shifted paradigms <eos> Go to Hawaii, get a whole new life <eos> 'Cause I feel the breeze just like a second wind <eos> Underneath my wings and I'm alive again <eos> Seeing everything through a new lens <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Going through a chrysalis (Oh yeah) <eos> Don't you ever wonder why, wonder why <eos> We've been going through all this <eos> Maybe there's a cocoon around the world <eos> And we're all dying just to break through <eos> 'Cause we'll be butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> La la la la la la la <eos> Going through a chrysalis <eos> La la la la la la la <eos> We won't even remember this (oh yeah) <eos> (Oh yeah) <eos> (Oh yeah) <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Oh, we'll be butterflies <eos> Butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> 
I really can't stay <eos> But baby it's cold outside <eos> I got to go away <eos> But baby it's cold outside <eos> This evening has been <eos> Been hoping that you'd drop in <eos> So very nice <eos> I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice <eos> My mother will start to worry <eos> Beautiful, what's your hurry? <eos> My father will be pacing the floor <eos> Listen to the fireplace roar <eos> So really, I'd better scurry <eos> Beautiful, please don't hurry <eos> But maybe just a half a drink more <eos> I'll put some records on while I pour <eos> The neighbours might think <eos> Baby, it's bad out there <eos> Say, what's in this drink? <eos> No cabs to be had out there <eos> I wish I knew how <eos> Your eyes are like starlight tonight <eos> To break this spell <eos> I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell <eos> I ought to say, no, no, no sir <eos> Oh, mind if I move in closer? <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried <eos> What's the sense in hurting my pride? <eos> I really can't stay <eos> But baby, don't hold out <eos> But baby it's cold outside! <eos> I simply must go <eos> But baby, it's cold outside <eos> The answer is no, no, no <eos> Aw baby, it's cold outside <eos> Your welcome has been <eos> How lucky that you dropped in <eos> So nice and warm <eos> Look out the window at that storm <eos> My sister will be suspicious <eos> Um gosh, your lips are delicious <eos> And my brother will be there at the door <eos> Waves on a tropical shore <eos> My maiden aunt's mind is vicious <eos> Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious <eos> But maybe just a cigarette more <eos> Oh never such a blizzard before <eos> I've got to get home <eos> But baby, you'll freeze out there <eos> Say lend me your coat <eos> Oh up to your knees out there <eos> You've really been grand <eos> I thrill when you touch my hand <eos> But you don't see, no, no <eos> How can you do this thing to me? <eos> There's bound to be talk tomorrow <eos> Think of my life long sorrow <eos> At least there will be plenty implied <eos> If you cought pneumonia and died <eos> But I really can't stay <eos> Get over that whole doubt <eos> But baby it's cold outside! <eos>

Daddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints <eos> What preachers were preaching You could take to the bank <eos> Kids played outside up until it turned dark <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Trucks took a beatin', the working man too <eos> You could turn on the six o' clock and get the whole truth <eos> A seat belt was a backup for Mama's right arm <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when thе world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Neighbors came by and talked on the porch <eos> We all said goodnight and never locked the front door <eos> Even downtown you could still see the stars <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could Smoke in a Bar <eos> A deal was a deal when you shook a man's hand <eos> When we saw the flag flying, We all gave a damn <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos>

Estaba pensando las cosas y por más que quiero <eos> Con la conclusión de que tu adrenalina yo soy <eos> Con esos besos salvajes, tu modo tan interesante <eos> Comprimir la realidad, sí me pones a temblar <eos> Tu amor es un mar de tristezas con mis emociones <eos> Y es que estoy tan acostumbrado a ponerme a llorar <eos> Si digo lo que estoy sintiendo, será el armamento perfecto <eos> Para la posibilidad de arrancarme de la faz <eos> Quiero llorar y no puedo <eos> Y mi orgullo tiene miedo <eos> De que se rompa con el tuyo <eos> Para volvernos a amar y empezar <eos> Quiero llorar de tristeza <eos> Y meterme en la cabeza <eos> Que tú y yo seremos la sombra <eos> De un amor que nunca se hará realidad <eos> Tu amor es un mar de tristezas con mis emociones <eos> Y es que estoy tan acostumbrado a ponerme a llorar <eos> Si digo lo que estoy sintiendo, será el armamento perfecto <eos> Para la posibilidad de arrancarme de la faz <eos> Quiero llorar y no puedo <eos> Y mi orgullo tiene miedo <eos> De que se rompa con el tuyo <eos> Para volvernos a amar y empezar <eos> Quiero llorar de tristeza <eos> Y meterme en la cabeza <eos> Que tú y yo seremos la sombra <eos> De un amor que nunca se hará realidad <eos> 
Uh, uh, uh <eos> No sé como empezó todo, mas hoy te amo <eos> Después de un gran sufrimiento vino mi amor <eos> Yo sé lo que es el tormento venido del sentimiento <eos> Y ahora se regocija mi corazón <eos> Todo esto se fue escribiendo día con día <eos> Tal vez en la hipocresía de un gran amor <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Uh, uh, uh <eos> No sé como empezó todo, más hoy te amo <eos> Después de un gran sufrimiento vino mi amor <eos> Yo sé lo que es el tormento venido del sentimiento <eos> Y ahora se regocija mi corazón <eos> Todo esto se fue escribiendo día con día <eos> Tal vez en la hipocresía de un gran amor <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> 
Summer through the window <eos> But I can't seem to let go <eos> And I know that I should feel a little better 'bout it but I don't <eos> Water running off my skin <eos> Trying to find a way to let you in <eos> And I know the puzzle pieces wanna fit together but they won't <eos> And I'd be the first to <eos> Be there for you <eos> If you needed me to <eos> But can't turn the tide <eos> I'm paralyzed <eos> What do I do <eos> Show me what I can't see <eos> 'Cause I don't recognise me <eos> Wide awake in my sleep <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos> I'm tripping over my feet <eos> With promises I can't keep <eos> I don't recognise me <eos> And it scares mе, oh it scares me <eos> Everybody's happy <eos> Evеrybody but me <eos> And I know it's just the voices in my head getting the best of me <eos> Yeah I thought that I would be alright <eos> Thought I'd put up a better fight <eos> Maybe now I need your help to get it back to where it's supposed to be <eos> And I'd be the first to <eos> Be there for you <eos> If you needed me to <eos> But can't turn the tide <eos> I'm paralyzed <eos> What do I do <eos> Show me what I can't see <eos> 'Cause I don't recognise me <eos> Wide awake in my sleep <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos> I'm tripping over my feet <eos> With promises I can't keep <eos> I don't recognise me <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos> 
Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing <eos> I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens <eos> I'm the small town <eos> One in seven billion <eos> Why can't it be me? <eos> They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> When did we all stop believing in magic? <eos> Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic? <eos> I'm the long shot <eos> I'm the Hail Mary <eos> Why can't it be me? <eos> They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down) <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> Hey, hey <eos> Oh, cover me in daisies <eos> Hey, hey <eos> I'm the small town <eos> One in seven billion <eos> Why can't it be me? <eos> They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out) <eos> Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house <eos> They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me <eos> 'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies <eos> 
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat <eos> I can hear you breathing near my ear <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> Anytime you want to you can turn me onto <eos> Anything you want to, anytime at all <eos> When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver <eos> Can't control the quivering inside <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter <eos> My whole world could shatter, I don't care <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> Oh, oh-oh-oh <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> 
Loving you isn't the right thing to do <eos> How can I ever change things that I feel? <eos> If I could, maybe I'd give you my world <eos> How can I when you won't take it from me? <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> Tell me why everything turned around <eos> Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do <eos> If I could, baby, I'd give you my world <eos> Open up, everything's waiting for you <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way <eos> 
Well, I was nineteen, you were twenty-one <eos> The year we got engaged <eos> And everyone said we were much too young <eos> But we did it anyway <eos> We got the rings for forty each <eos> From a pawn shop down the road <eos> We said our vows and took the leap <eos> Now fifteen years ago <eos> And we went dancing in the minefields <eos> We went sailing in the storms <eos> And it was harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> "I do" are the two most famous last words <eos> The beginning of the end <eos> But to lose your life for another, I've heard <eos> Is a good place to begin <eos> 'Cause the only way to find your life <eos> Is to lay your own life down <eos> And I believe it's an easy price <eos> For the life that we have found <eos> And we're dancing in the minefields <eos> We're sailing in the storms <eos> This is harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> That's what the promise is for <eos> So when I loose my way, find me <eos> When I loose love's chains, bind me <eos> At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days <eos> When I forget my name, remind me <eos> 'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man <eos> So there's nothing left to fear <eos> So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands <eos> Till the shadows disappear <eos> 'Cause he promised not to leave us <eos> And his promises are true <eos> So in the face of all this chaos <eos> Baby, I can dance with you <eos> So let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> Let's go sailing in the storms <eos> Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> And kicking down the doors <eos> Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> And sailing in the storms <eos> Oh, this is harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> That's what the promise is for <eos> 
We're sittin' 'round on the couch <eos> We were makin' words with our mouths <eos> We had a pile of junk <eos> That's already runnin' out <eos> You think we're out of stuff <eos> But, hey, I'll tell you what <eos> Look, there's a little left there in the corner <eos> And I ain't had enough <eos> There's some more fun to be had <eos> If you lick the bag <eos> Well, turn the bag inside out <eos> And rub it in your mouth <eos> Suck on it for a while <eos> To get the rest of it out <eos> And if you're feelin' down <eos> You can lick the bag <eos> There ain't enough of it left <eos> To make a little line <eos> No need to get upset <eos> Yeah, you don't need to cry <eos> 'Cause there's some more fun to be had <eos> Lyin' in the corners of the bag <eos> So shove it in your mouth <eos> Yeah, you can lick the bag <eos> There's some more fun to be had <eos> If you lick the bag <eos> Bag <eos> Gather 'round, gather 'round <eos> Hey, kids, I wanna know something <eos> Are we all out of that good stuff? (No) <eos> And have we had enough? (No) <eos> Tell me what we're gonna do with that bag <eos> (We're gonna lick it) <eos> What did you say, kids? <eos> (Lick the bag) <eos> I said what did you say, kids? <eos> (Lick the bag) <eos> 
Last week my life had meaning <eos> It was beautiful and so sweet <eos> But now it's nothing <eos> Nothing without you, baby <eos> My whole world is incomplete <eos> 'Cause honey I can't see you no more <eos> That was all that you said, baby <eos> But you just might as well have <eos> Placed a gun to my head <eos> Baby, baby, oh, why did you do it <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Yeah, yes it did, honey <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground, baby <eos> Did you ever mean those sweet things <eos> Ah, that you use to say <eos> Did you mean 'em baby <eos> Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden <eos> And a little baby someday <eos> Oh, tell me, baby <eos> Where did I go wrong, honey <eos> Whatever changed your mind, baby <eos> I've asked myself these questions over a million times <eos> Baby, baby, oh, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Oh, yes it did, baby, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby <eos> Oh baby, now my body is numb <eos> I feel, feel so senseless to the touch <eos> My life is so wasted <eos> So wasted without you <eos> I guess I love too much, too much <eos> Oh, baby, how can I face tomorrow <eos> When yesterday is all I see <eos> I just don't want to face tomorrow <eos> If you're not sharing it with me <eos> Baby, baby, oh, tell me why <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Oh, yes it did, baby, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground <eos> Baby, I keep holding on, holding on <eos> Although your love is gone, baby <eos>

Got a piece of my mind, to tell you who's mine <eos> Nobody hurts like me for you. <eos> Soft slacks at night, I'm wearing 'em tight <eos> Nobody hurts like I do. <eos> Your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine <eos> So stop feeding me, 'a little more time' <eos> Your shit's a mess, I'm not yours to undress <eos> I'm leaving this love for the last time. <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine. <eos> You've got the means to caress, but weak you leave me a mess <eos> One touch is enough, your hands, a little too rough <eos> Will I ever be enough? <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> We fall the fader to black, release the ropes and feel the slack <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I tell you every time, you're walking a fine, fine line <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I'm not yours <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> 
Blood starved machine in a feeding frenzy <eos> Don't look now, but the floor is collapsing <eos> No escape, the plummet is everlasting <eos> Sound awake in the bed I've made <eos> Pull out the pin, sanity is a grenade <eos> Dead and sound awake <eos> You could lose yourself in the absence of loss <eos> Reset and wander far away <eos> Dead and sound awake, ambitions thrown away <eos> Spirits washed away, you should know <eos> Nothing lasts forever <eos> Following footprints in circles, going snowblind <eos> Exits overgrown inside the maze of my mind <eos> Crawling out of the crypt to bleed the living dry <eos> In this fantasy, the villains win, the heroes die <eos> Slow diving to despair <eos> Fuck it, I'm done, this is a waking nightmare <eos> Blood starved machine in a feeding frenzy <eos> Dead and sound awake <eos> You could lose yourself in the absence of loss <eos> Reset and wander far away <eos> Dead and sound awake, ambitions thrown away <eos> Spirits washed away, you should know <eos> Nothing lasts forever <eos> Black moon rising <eos> Glimpse of madness <eos> Blossom black rose <eos> Withered, abandoned <eos> Sorrowed, sleepless, alone <eos> Sleepless nights, hearing voices <eos> Faint whispers expand like disease <eos> The dead are not dreaming <eos> Can't you hear them screaming? <eos> Oh <eos> This is a waking nightmare <eos> Crawling out of the crypt to bleed the living dry <eos> In this fantasy, the villains win, the heroes die <eos> Slow diving to despair <eos> Fuck it, I'm done, this is a waking nightmare <eos> 
She said, "Hold me, baby, I think I need saving <eos> I think I need a hero, I think I need you" <eos> I said she's borderline insane, but I like it <eos> I think I might love it and I think I love you <eos> Girl, you got me hoping <eos> We could get going <eos> We could get lonely, baby <eos> Fogging up my windows <eos> Got my backseat smelling like oranges and roses <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> She said, "Hold mе, baby, I think I need healing (Oh yeah) <eos> I think I need a miracle (Oh yеah), but I'm good here with you" <eos> She said, "Kiss me, baby, I need a revival <eos> I need a good preaching, but I need it from you" <eos> Girl, you got me hoping <eos> We could get going <eos> We could get lonely, baby <eos> Fogging up my windows <eos> Got my backseat smelling like oranges and roses <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> Tangerine, tangerine <eos> Got you dripping juice like tangerine, tangerine <eos> 
I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> I wish you could have seen us <eos> Begging for change to get home <eos> Or at least San Francisco <eos> Let's put a ten on the high card <eos> And spend a summer on the West Coast <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you (memories) <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue (memories) <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you (memories) <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos> 
I can’t believe it’s over <eos> I was there they said “forever” <eos> It’s getting harder to pretend <eos> It’s good to know that it’s on-trend <eos> Take the weight up off their shoulders <eos> It’s better now before they grow up <eos> These are some of my best friends <eos> Things like this never happen <eos> I’m smiling again <eos> Like we did when we were younger <eos> Wash me clеan with holy water <eos> Take me down on thе weekend <eos> Savor the flavor of wet skin <eos> Now you and me, we can’t be closer <eos> We are different than the others <eos> I’m begging for your attention <eos> Things like this never happen <eos> Lay me down again <eos> Oh lover, don't let it in <eos> Tell me it’s true (true) <eos> Tell me it's true (true) <eos> Tell me it's— <eos> Tell me <eos> Tell me <eos> Tell me it's true <eos> I can’t believe he told her <eos> Did she know before he told her? <eos> It’s feeling more like a loose end <eos> It’s better now they can be friends <eos> I’m smiling again <eos> And as for me I fuck things over <eos> Talk me down, keep your composure <eos> Lay me down again <eos> Oh lover, don’t let it in <eos> Tell me it’s true <eos> Tell me it's true <eos> Tell me it's— <eos> What you want, it’s what you need <eos> Your happiness depends on me <eos> If you want me if you need me <eos> Tell me that you’ll never leave <eos> Insecure my tendency <eos> I do believe that we can make it through (tell me) <eos> Tell me that’s true (tell me) <eos> Now that I think about it <eos> I can't believe it's over <eos> These are some of my best friends <eos> 
Down around the corner <eos> Half a mile from here <eos> You see them long trains runnin' <eos> And you watch 'em disappear <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> You know I saw Miss Lucy <eos> Down along the tracks <eos> She lost her home and her family <eos> And she won't be coming back <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now-na-na-now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, pistons keep on churnin' <eos> And the wheels go 'round and 'round <eos> And the steel rails lie cold and hard <eos> On the mountains they go down <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Ooh, where would you be now? <eos> Mmm, got to get you, baby baby, won't you move it down? <eos> Won't you move it down? <eos> Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down? <eos> When the big train run <eos> When the train is movin' on <eos> I got to keep on movin' <eos> Keep on movin' <eos> Won't you keep on movin'? <eos> Gonna keep on movin' <eos>

Por las noches la miro <eos> En un negro vestido <eos> Con tacones tan altos, que hacen que camine tan lindo <eos> Su sonrisa tan tierna <eos> Sus ojitos de perlas <eos> Y la luz de la luna, se refleja en su piel de seda <eos> En su piel de seda <eos> Y al tomarle la mano <eos> Beso sus dulces labios <eos> Me pierdo en su mirada, no hay palabras que puedan explicarlo <eos> Su sonrisa tan tierna <eos> Sus ojitos de perlas <eos> Y la luz de la luna, se refleja en su piel de seda <eos> En su piel de seda <eos> Alguna vez has visto <eos> Al sol cobijarse con las olas del mar <eos> La noche vino <eos> Comienzo este sueño y no pienso despertar <eos> Oh no, oh no no <eos> No oh no <eos> 
When dreaming I'm guided to another world <eos> Time and time again <eos> At sunrise I fight to stay asleep <eos> Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place <eos> Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape <eos> From the life I live when I'm awake <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Although I would like our world to change <eos> It helps me to appreciate <eos> Those nights and those dreams <eos> But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights <eos> If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same <eos> The only difference is <eos> To let love replace all our hate <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> 
I bet you thought your life would change <eos> But you're sat on a train again <eos> Your memories are sceneries for things you said <eos> But never really meant <eos> You build it to a high to say goodbye <eos> Because you're not the same as them <eos> But your death it won't happen to you <eos> It happens to your family and your friends <eos> I pretend <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> You win, you lose, you sing the blues <eos> There's no point in buying concrete shoes <eos> I'll refuse <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die <eos> Am I me through geography? <eos> A face collapsed through entropy <eos> I can hardly speak <eos> And when I try it's nothing but a squeak <eos> On the video <eos> Living room for small <eos> If you can't survive, just try <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> And I always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die, sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> I, sometimes, always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die, sometimes <eos> 
Oh, you've got the feeling that I wanna feel <eos> Oh, you've got that feeling that I know is real, real, real <eos> It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love <eos> And I can see that this is real, is real <eos> It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch <eos> And I can see... <eos> This is real, real, real, real love <eos> This is real, real, real, real love <eos> You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling <eos> You give me that, you give me that real love <eos> You give me that feeling, you give me that feelings <eos> You give me that, you give me real love <eos> You give me that, you give me real love <eos> You give me that, you give me real love <eos> Oh, before I was searchin' for a rarity <eos> Oh, you showed me things I've never thought that I would see <eos> It's in the way you look, it's in the way you love <eos> And I can see that this is real, real <eos> It's in the way you talk, it's in the way you touch <eos> And I can see... <eos> This is real, real, real, real love <eos> This is real, real, real, real love <eos> You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling <eos> You give me that, you give me real love <eos> You give me that feeling, you give me that feeling <eos> You give me that, you give me real love <eos> Real, real, real, real love <eos> This is real, real, real, real love <eos> 
Don't you know I'm no good for you? <eos> I've learned to lose you, can't afford to <eos> Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin' <eos> But nothin' ever stops you leavin' <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> Don't you know too much already? <eos> I'll only hurt you if you let me <eos> Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back) <eos> And I'll call you when the party's over <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> But nothin' is better sometimes <eos> Once we've both said our goodbyes <eos> Let's just let it go <eos> Let me let you go <eos> Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that <eos> 
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love <eos> Even more than I usually do <eos> And although I know it's a long road back <eos> I promise you <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please have snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents by the tree <eos> Christmas eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in my dreams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please have some snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents by the tree <eos> 
Maybe it's nice to be alone in the end <eos> You know I'm fine living so close to the edge <eos> Who needs a house when I've got all these friends? <eos> They say: "Are you gonna give up some day?" <eos> "Are you gonna grow up some day?" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Don't need a license when you've got no drive <eos> It feels so right taking the wrong advice <eos> They tell me one day that I'll pay the price <eos> They saying: "Maybe I'll go up in flames" <eos> "Maybe it'll blow up one day" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live my life, live my life <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> 
(kotetsu on the beat) <eos> (You ready, K?) <eos> You drought me <eos> I'm falling <eos> I know the worst is coming <eos> Don't know where <eos> I'm going <eos> Can't get out from this slumber <eos> You drought me <eos> I'm falling <eos> I know the worst is coming <eos> Don't know where <eos> I'm going <eos> Can't get out from this slumber <eos> I don't know what I did wrong <eos> Sometimes I'm not too strong <eos> I don't want to make this long <eos> I just want to let it go <eos> Put a gun in my mouth <eos> Shoot gently, don't take doubt <eos> Cause I wanna feel the pain <eos> Crossing slowly to my brain <eos> I'm so tired about this life <eos> About theese ghosts <eos> With hunting knives <eos> I hear them from I was five <eos> Maybe I need to strive <eos> It's so cold, here outside <eos> I promise, I fukking tried <eos> My life is a fukking lie <eos> I don't wanna die <eos> Listen to me, listen to my soul <eos> Drown em' deeper, it would take so long <eos> Voices in my head, they scream so loud <eos> Voices in my head, I can't hold on <eos> I can't get out from this fukking nightmare <eos> I can't get out from here <eos> You drought me <eos> I'm falling <eos> I know the worst is coming <eos> Don't know where <eos> I'm going <eos> Can't get out from this slumber <eos> You drought me <eos> I'm falling <eos> I know the worst is coming <eos> Don't know where <eos> I'm going <eos> Can't get out from this slumber <eos> Listen to my friends <eos> They tell me all day <eos> “Everything’s ok” <eos> I just can forgive <eos> But I won't’t forget <eos> All the shit you made <eos> Listen to me, listen to my soul <eos> Drown em' deeper, it would take so long <eos> Voices in my head, they scream so loud <eos> Voices in my head, I can't hold on <eos> This is Melancholy Despair by Fukking Space Cowboys <eos> We hope you liked it... <eos> This is... <eos> The beginning <eos> 
See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own <eos> Business as I kick up the treble tone <eos> On my radio tape player box, right <eos> Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? <eos> Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin' <eos> Investigation maybe she was demonstratin' <eos> But nevertheless I was pleased <eos> My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease <eos> Until a group of brothers started buggin' out <eos> Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route <eos> Disrespectin' my black queen <eos> Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene <eos> At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type <eos> They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight <eos> And they see a young couple having a time that's good <eos> And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood <eos> So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do <eos> And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!) <eos> I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit <eos> And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it <eos> Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be <eos> But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy <eos> Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me? <eos> 'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> I told the niggas please let us pass, friend <eos> I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans <eos> But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube <eos> But I had to take the brother out for being rude <eos> And like I said before I was mad by then <eos> It took three or four cops to pull me off of him <eos> But that's the story y'all of a black man <eos> Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African <eos> You see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> The moral of the story is <eos> You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to <eos> 'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it <eos> Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite <eos> 
Have you ever felt like you just couldn't be yourself <eos> Like it'd be easier if you were someone else <eos> Is there a voice inside your mind <eos> That reminds you all the time <eos> The ways you're broken <eos> Has it left you hopeless? <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never be enough <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never measure up <eos> Are you just trying to escape? <eos> Trying to run from all the pain <eos> Of being human <eos> Can you make it through it? <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> 
I don't commit, I just collide <eos> I won't submit, I'll just decide <eos> On where to run or where to hide <eos> Their eyes are everywhere <eos> I see them spying there <eos> At my face, at my hair <eos> I won't plug in, to their machine <eos> I hate the sound, I hate that scene <eos> I sure ain't hip, I sure can't hop <eos> I lost the script, I lost the plot <eos> Their spies are everywhere <eos> I feel them hiding there <eos> On my face, in my hair <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> It's pushing down, down, down <eos> Down on me <eos> Look at me, what you see <eos> Is social debris <eos> You said you'd treat me, but tried to delete me <eos> You think I'm tragic, but I know I'm magic <eos> Your eyes are everywhere <eos> I see you spying there <eos> At my face, at my hair <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> Pushing down, down, down <eos> Down on me <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> I'm social debris <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> Social debris <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> Social debris <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> I'm social debris <eos> 
You know <eos> The fire is running low <eos> Can you feel the flame her fading glow <eos> You know <eos> We are slowing down <eos> I can hear your footsteps drowning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> You are <eos> You singing now a song <eos> But you heard it somewhere else I know <eos> We are <eos> We're trying to belong <eos> Pick up the pieces left of us <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> If you can see me running up to you <eos> You know <eos> I've been running in circles around you <eos> If you could tell me I was back in time <eos> You know <eos> I've been running in circles for you <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> The lie has fallen from the stars <eos> Now your sinking through the night <eos> Out of sight we're falling underground <eos> Pick up the pieces left of us <eos> If you can see me running up to you <eos> We know ... <eos> I've been running in circles around you <eos> If you could tell me I was back in time <eos> You know ... <eos> I've been running in circles for you <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> You know ... <eos> The fire is running low  <eos>

If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place <eos> (You can't run, you can't hide, you can't run, you can't hide) <eos> Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face <eos> Oh yeah, yeah <eos> If you just put your hand in mine <eos> We're gonna leave all our troubles behind <eos> We're gonna walk and don't look back (Don't look back) <eos> And don't look back (Don't look back), oh yeah, yeah <eos> And don't look back, baby (Don't look back) <eos> (The past is behind you, don't let them remind you) <eos> If your first lover broke your heart <eos> There's something that can be done <eos> (You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide) <eos> Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done <eos> So if you just put your hand in mine <eos> We're gonna leave all our troubles behind <eos> Keep on walking, don't look back (Don't look back) <eos> Forget about the past now <eos> Don't look back, baby (Don't look back) <eos> Keep on walking and don't look back, mmm (Don't look back) <eos> (The past behind you, don't let them remind you) <eos> Love can be a beautiful thing <eos> Though your first love let you down <eos> Oh yeah, yeah <eos> (You don't run, you don't hide, you don't run, you don't hide) <eos> 'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby <eos> The second time around <eos> Oh yeah, yeah <eos> So if you just put your hand in mine <eos> We're gonna leave all our troubles behind <eos> Keep on pushing and don't look back (Don't look back) <eos> Now, what'd I say, we won't look back, girl (Don't look back) <eos> Keep on walking and won't look back <eos> Forget about the past now, baby (Don't look back) <eos> And don't look back (Don't look back) <eos> Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back <eos> 
The sun is shining <eos> There's plenty of light <eos> A new day is dawning <eos> Sunny and bright <eos> But after I've been crying all night <eos> The sun is cold <eos> And the new day seems old <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> The birds are singing <eos> And the children are playing <eos> There's plenty of work <eos> And the bosses are paying <eos> Not a sad word should <eos> A young heart be saying <eos> But fun is a bore <eos> And with money I'm poor <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Next time I'll be kinder <eos> (Next time I'll be kinder) <eos> Won't you please help me find her <eos> (Won't you please help me find her) <eos> Someone just remind her <eos> (Someone just remind her) <eos> Of this love she left behind her <eos> (Of this love she left behind her) <eos> 'Til I find her I'll be trying <eos> ('Til I find her I'll be trying) <eos> Every day I'm more inclined to find her <eos> Inclined to find her <eos> (Inclined to find my baby) <eos> Been looking everywhere (Baby) <eos> Baby, I really, really care <eos> Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah) <eos> Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah) <eos> Can't see how my hope's gonna last <eos> Good things are bad <eos> And what's happy is sad <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Everything is wrong (Since I lost my baby) <eos> This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby) <eos> What's gonna happen to me? <eos> 
We're in the homestretch of the hard times <eos> We took a hard left, but we're alright <eos> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but <eos> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I <eos> Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried <eos> No, it don't always go the way we planned it <eos> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> When the bones are good <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter) <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah) <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain) <eos> 'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo) <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo) <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Yeah, ooh <eos>

All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain <eos> Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain <eos> She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame <eos> Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos> Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law <eos> Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw <eos> He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night <eos> He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, facing where the lines are broken <eos> Oh, name your price to all this living <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, face it where the lines are broken <eos> Oh, name a price to all that's living <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos> 
...It's just not right, it's <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh, oh <eos> I just wanna see your face at home, home, home <eos> You can't do me right <eos> So I... decide that <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, no more <eos> I just wanna see you up and out, out of the door, oh <eos> I'm not living right <eos> So I... decide that <eos> I don't wanna be your girl no more, oh oh <eos> I won't hide the ways, I've tried <eos> It's just not right <eos> It's killing me tonight <eos> So, so <eos> 
I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on <eos> I have screamed until my veins collapsed <eos> I've waited as my time's elapsed <eos> Now all I do is live with so much fate <eos> I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <eos> I've left behind this little fact <eos> You cannot kill what you did not create <eos> I've gotta say what I've gotta say <eos> And then I swear I'll go away <eos> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <eos> I guess I'll save the best for last <eos> My future seems like one big past <eos> You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <eos> Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone <eos> Tell me the reality is better than the dream <eos> But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos>

I wish I would've met you <eos> Now it's a little late <eos> What you could've taught me <eos> I could've saved some face <eos> They think that your early ending was all wrong <eos> For the most part, they're right <eos> But look how they all got strong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> Now that the smoke's gone <eos> And the air is all clear <eos> Those who were right there <eos> Got a new kind of fear <eos> You'd fight and you were right <eos> But they were just too strong <eos> They'd stick it in your face <eos> And let you smell what they consider wrong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> What a good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I'd say, "Nice shot." <eos> 
Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cruzaste la frontera de otro cuerpo <eos> Por qué saltaste hacia el abismo de otros besos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Cada mañana en el reflejo de mis sueños <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cambiaste nuestro amor por un antojo <eos> Y desnudaste tu pudor ante otros ojos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué perdiste el equilibrio y te alejaste de mi vida... <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo en aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Muy buena suerte <eos> Yo te deseo un paraíso de mentiras <eos> Un universo con estrellas que no brillan <eos> Yo te quería <eos> Y me obligaste renunciar a la mitad de mi alegría <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías... <eos> Un día entenderás que fue un error <eos> Cambiar la realidad por fantasía <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos> 
Got ready for the night and <eos> She’s heading for the lights <eos> She sees the vision going <eos> Hopping line after line <eos> See how she looks for trouble <eos> See how she dances and <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> That's what you’re coming for <eos> But they don’t want to let you in and <eos> You drop your bag to the floor and <eos> You ask them what's happening <eos> Well it's getting late now, hey now <eos> Enough of the arguments <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> Oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet) <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet) <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh (She can't tell the difference yet) <eos> That's what you’re coming for <eos> But they don’t want to let you in and <eos> You drop your bag to the floor and <eos> You ask them what's happening <eos> It's getting late now, hey now <eos> Enough of the arguments <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> That's what you’re coming for <eos> But they don’t want to let you in and <eos> You drop your bag to the floor and <eos> You ask them what's happening <eos> Well it's getting late now, hey now <eos> Enough of the arguments <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> Oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Got ready for the night and <eos> She’s heading for the lights <eos> She sees the vision going <eos> Hopping line after line <eos> See how she looks for trouble <eos> See how she dances and <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet, she can’t tell the difference yet <eos> Oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> Oh oh oh, oh oh oh <eos> That's what you’re coming for <eos> But they don’t want to let you in and <eos> You drop your bag to the floor and <eos> You ask them what's happening <eos> Well it's getting late now, hey now <eos> Enough of the arguments <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> That's what you’re coming for <eos> But they don’t want to let you in and <eos> You drop your bag to the floor and <eos> You ask them what's happening <eos> Well it's getting late now, hey now <eos> Enough of the arguments <eos> She sips the Coca-Cola <eos> She can’t tell the difference yet <eos> 
Letra de ''La Botella'' <eos> Aja aja wuouohh yeiyyee.. <eos> Mach and daddy (x2) <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera y me ha quemado hasta morir <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera es traicionera <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Todo lo que le brindé <eos> Le di mi amor y mi cariño también <eos> Lo que ella me pedía se lo daba también <eos> Un carro una casa y me preguntó por que por que <eos> Ella se fue con otro hombre <eos> Ahora de la paja solito me quede borracho y tirado <eos> Con ganas de beber y le dije al cantinero otra vez <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Todos los que han sido traicionados <eos> Y con la botella se han desahogado <eos> A la cuenta de 3 quiero ver todo <eos> El mundo con el coro one, two <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera es traicionera <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos> 
Cruel one convinced you in his stillness <eos> In a dream, safe and harmless <eos> Unknown to you <eos> Wolf in sheep’s clothing <eos> Hand over mouth <eos> His secrets you’re holding <eos> I can see you and the ache you’re hiding <eos> I’m here you know I’ll always remind you <eos> Lonely one, I always knew <eos> The future tells a hazel view <eos> Gemstone, like polish and acetone <eos> For you are my sister sewn <eos> I know you like the drive home <eos> Breath deep, the knower’s perspective <eos> You’ll see how the rest of this is undeniable <eos> Hold out for June, it brings new season <eos> Vision is clear, your mind revealing <eos> Pressing the flower in the page <eos> Forever kept, a memory made <eos> Now you’re so sure, you’re always leading <eos> All the same words now bring new meaning <eos> I can hear you and I know you’re singing <eos> “I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.” <eos> Lovely one <eos> Four leaf luck <eos> Skilled hands built you up <eos> Hold out for June, it brings new season <eos> Vision is clear, your mind revealing <eos> Pressing the flower in the page <eos> Forever kept, a memory made <eos> Now you’re so sure, you’re always leading <eos> All the same words now bring new meaning <eos> I can hear you and I know you’re singing <eos> “I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.” <eos> “I’m here you know I’ll always remind you.” <eos> 
Cradle me, I'll cradle you <eos> I'll win your heart with a woop-a-woo <eos> Pulling shapes just for your eyes <eos> So with toothpaste kisses and lines <eos> I'll be yours and you'll be... <eos> Lay with me, I'll lay with you <eos> We'll do the things that lovers do <eos> Put the stars in our eyes <eos> And with heart shaped bruises <eos> And late night kisses, divine <eos> So with toothpaste kisses and lines <eos> Stay with me, I'll stay with you <eos> Doin' things that lovers do <eos> What else to do? <eos> 
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans <eos> Way back up in the woods among the evergreens <eos> There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood <eos> Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode <eos> Who never ever learned to read or write so well <eos> But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack <eos> Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track <eos> Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade <eos> Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made <eos> People passing by they would stop and say <eos> Oh my, but that little country boy could play <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> His mother told him "Someday you will be a man <eos> And you will be the leader of a big old band <eos> Many people coming from miles around <eos> To hear you play your music when the sun go down <eos> Maybe someday your name will be in lights <eos> Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'" <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go <eos> Go go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Go, Johnny B. Goode <eos>

You're tired now, lie down <eos> I'll be waitin' to give you the good news <eos> It might take patience <eos> And when you wake up, it won't be over <eos> So don't you give up <eos> We've got the time to take the world <eos> And make it better than it ever was <eos> That's what they'll say about us <eos> If I say a cliché, it's 'cause I mean it <eos> We can't walk away, we gotta get in between it <eos> And when you wake up, we'll grow together <eos> So don't you give up <eos> We've got the time to take the world <eos> And make it better than it ever was <eos> That's what they'll say about us <eos> I never said it would be easy <eos> I'm never giving up, believe me <eos> I used to think the pain would fade, but it never does <eos> You're tired now, lie down <eos> I'll be waitin' to give you the good news <eos> It might take patience <eos> And if you don't wake up <eos> I'll know you tried to <eos> I wish you could see him <eos> He looks just like you <eos>

You're taking what you want right from me <eos> Wrapped up in so much <eos> Life is just the way you hold me <eos> You pick your miscellaneously <eos> Wrapped up in all the choices you're not giving to me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to  fill the empty spaces <eos> You're saying what you want right to me <eos> No filter on your mouth, we know you talk in your sleep <eos> Remembering the times they won't remember me <eos> Our nights melt into sequels, you sink into me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit, just a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of, oh <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> 
Voices, in my head again <eos> Trapped in a war inside my own skin <eos> They're pulling me under (Go) <eos> I've swallowed myself but the fever remains <eos> I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain <eos> If I showed you my soul would you cover your eyes? <eos> If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie? <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices, Voices <eos> As I walk through this valley of shadows and death <eos> I curse not the “wicked”, I praise not the “blessed” <eos> If I told you the truth, you’d beg me to change <eos> If fear were a currency, you’d own the bank <eos> Voices, In my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices <eos> I don't want to live <eos> So calloused and frozen <eos> Ugly and hopeless <eos> I don't want to live forever <eos> I just want to live right now <eos> You can't take me from me <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Head again <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices <eos> (They're pulling me under) <eos> Voices <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices, voices <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> 
Get off your sled and go to bed <eos> Don't you ever tire? <eos> Throw a bone, I'm finally home <eos> Curled up by the fire <eos> Snow is falling from the sky <eos> Like ashes from an urn <eos> Sweet dreams, my little one <eos> Now it's my turn <eos> Well, Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> Now, when I sleep I like to dream <eos> Of rabbits in the snow <eos> Jumping right into my jaws <eos> From their rabbit hole <eos> Take one home and set him down <eos> Right next to your shoes <eos> Wake up to a big surprise <eos> My gift to you <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> So I'll just stay here and chew <eos> 
I know your heart <eos> And I know your downfall <eos> Though we fell apart <eos> It was no one's fault <eos> I've gotta make you remember <eos> How hard it was to let me go <eos> Slow dancing with a stranger <eos> But I found somebody new <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes just like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Back when we started <eos> I was a fighter <eos> I kept my guard up <eos> But I took it down for you <eos> Oh, what a thing to do <eos> What do you tell your friends? <eos> The ones I'll never see again <eos> What are you filling in their heads? <eos> I found another ex <eos> Some temporary settlement <eos> To kiss the heartbreak off my lips <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> 
Feels like a distant mem'ry <eos> When I first laid eyes on you <eos> it was a little more than friendly <eos> and I won't pretend I'm ready <eos> but I'll tell you this for free <eos> I'm ready as I'll ever be <eos> I was fine on my own <eos> You came and rocked my boat <eos> as I floated down the river <eos> It's no secret that I hate a ... <eos> so keep it to yourself <eos> don't be a b*tch about it <eos> Am I lonely? Oh if only. <eos> Got better things to think about than falling in love with you <eos> Am I lonely? Oh if only <eos> I can't catch your way without being right next to you, ooh <eos> nananana... <eos> Nothing lasts forever <eos> 'cept waiting on my own <eos> for you to get your ass together <eos> take your time, won't you baby <eos> take a moment or two <eos> think about someone else but you <eos> It's no secret that I hate a ... <eos> so keep it to yourself <eos> don't be a b*tch about it <eos> don't be a b*tch about it <eos> Am I lonely?

Trapped in purgatory <eos> A lifeless object, alive <eos> Awaiting reprisal <eos> Death will be their acquittance <eos> The sky is turning red <eos> Return to power draws near <eos> Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears <eos> Abolish the rules made of stone <eos> Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past <eos> Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above <eos> Awaiting the hour of reprisal <eos> Your time slips away <eos> Raining blood <eos> From a lacerated sky <eos> Bleeding its horror <eos> Creating my structure <eos> Now, I shall reign in blood <eos>

Don't you ever leave me out <eos> Are these pieces of you? <eos> You never show <eos> Now I'll never know <eos> You needed to <eos> Get high just to prove <eos> You've got control <eos> And I wanna believe it <eos> The faces we put on our scars <eos> And then they let me down <eos> I’m famous for my flaws and scars <eos> I’ll take them lying down <eos> I’ve got nothing left to prove <eos> I've been left alone all my time spent in my head <eos> Try defending all my sins <eos> And if you could only know my body language <eos> We could hold conversations <eos> I've been patient <eos> Leave me out <eos> All these things that we do <eos> They help us grow <eos> Just let me go <eos> You needed me to <eos> Get clean just for you <eos> We never spoke <eos> We never address this true <eos> The faces we put on our scars <eos> And then they let me down <eos> I’m famous for my flaws and scars <eos> It's such a heavy crown <eos> When they all got eyes on you <eos> I've been left alone all my time spent in my head <eos> Try defending all my sins <eos> And if you could only know my body language <eos> We could hold conversations <eos> I've been patient <eos> You said you're running out <eos> I don't want to believe it <eos> You said you've grown it <eos> You know I won't <eos> You said I let you down <eos> I don't want to believe it <eos> I know I won't x2 <eos> I've been left alone all my time spent in my head <eos> Try defending all my sins <eos> And if you could only know my body language <eos> We could hold conversations <eos> I've been patient <eos> I've been left alone all my time spent in my head <eos> Try defending all my sins <eos> And if you could only know my body language <eos> We could hold conversations <eos> I've been patient <eos> 
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen <eos> Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen <eos> But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> Had a very shiny nose <eos> And if you ever saw it <eos> You would even say it glows <eos> All of the other reindeer <eos> Used to laugh and call him names <eos> They never let poor Rudolph <eos> Join in any reindeer games <eos> Then one foggy Christmas Eve <eos> Santa came to say <eos> Rudolph with your nose so bright <eos> Won't you guide my sleigh tonight <eos> Then how the reindeer loved him <eos> As they shouted out with glee <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> You'll go down in history <eos> (Repeat) <eos>

Sittin' on my own, chewin' on a bone <eos> A thousand million miles from home <eos> When something hit me <eos> Somewhere right between the eyes <eos> Sleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complain <eos> You took your last chance once again <eos> I landed, stranded <eos> Hardly even knew your name <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> Until the morning light <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life <eos> You and me see how we are <eos> You and me see how we are <eos> All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade <eos> And you make sure I eat today <eos> You take me walking <eos> To where you played when you were young <eos> I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry <eos> And this I'll say, I don't know why <eos> I know I'm leavin' <eos> But I'll be back another day <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> Until the morning light <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (You saved my life) <eos> I wanna talk tonight (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos>

The first time I ever talked to you <eos> My heart told me you were a dream came true <eos> And the first time you put your hand in mine <eos> I was wishing it would last a lifetime <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> And we kept close under the mistletoe <eos> As we watched the moonlit shadow in the snow <eos> And it was then, that I knew for sure <eos> That I got just what I asked for <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> I know I see angels <eos> When I look in your eyes <eos> When I wake Christmas Day <eos> You'll be my big surprise <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>  Well, Ron, you know Christmas is all the same man <eos> Yeah, Mike, and I can't wait to the 25th <eos>  Because I know my mother bought me something very special <eos>  Special? There's nothing more special <eos> Than being under the Christmas tree with your family <eos> Opening gifts, spreading love, that's a serious feeling <eos>  Well fellas, let's remember that the spirit of Christmas is all about giving <eos> What do you think, Ralph? <eos>  What, who me, Rick? Well, the greatest gift I could ever have <eos> Is to spend Christmas with my two favorite girls: <eos> My mother and of course my Candy Girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>

I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall <eos> And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call <eos> It's just another call from home <eos> And you'll get it and be gone <eos> And I'll be crying <eos> And I'll be begging you, baby <eos> Beg you not to leave <eos> But I'll be left here waiting <eos> With my heart on my sleeve <eos> Oh, for the next time we'll be here <eos> Seems like a million years <eos> And I think I'm dying <eos> What do I have to do to make you see <eos> She can't love you like me? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> You keep telling me, baby <eos> There will come a time <eos> When you will leave her arms <eos> And forever be in mine <eos> But I don't think that's the truth <eos> And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting <eos> It's too much pain to have to bear <eos> To love a man you have to share <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> I can't take it any longer <eos> But my will is getting stronger <eos> And I think I know just what I have to do <eos> I can't waste another minute <eos> After all that I've put in it <eos> I've given you my best <eos> Why does she get the best of you <eos> So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm up off my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> You can't give me what I need <eos> When she begs you not to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> I don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay, yeah? <eos> 
When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> When I wake each morning <eos> As the storm beats down on me <eos> And I know we belong together <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When we touch each other <eos> In a state of ecstasy <eos> Want this night to last forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> 
Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie <eos> We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt <eos> We got a little crazy but we never got caught <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Aw haw <eos> Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy <eos> I was willin' but she wasn't ready <eos> So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone <eos> I dropped her off early but I didn't go home <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie <eos> We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt <eos> We got a little crazy but we never got caught <eos> Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy <eos> I was willin' but she wasn't ready <eos> So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone <eos> I dropped her off early but I didn't go home <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a living for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Yeah-eee <eos> That's right <eos>

Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon <eos> (How does it feel when you've got no herb?) <eos> You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June <eos> (If you got no herb you will walk an' talk) <eos> So I lef' my gate and went out for a walk <eos> As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I hear them say <eos> (How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?) <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> So I stopped to find out what was going on <eos> (How do you find when you make your stuff?) <eos> For the spirit of Jah, you know he leads me on <eos> (Them all have a leaf at the dreadlocks' camp) <eos> There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing <eos> I could feel the chill as I see and heard them say <eos> (How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?) <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> 
Good King Wenceslas looked out <eos> On the feast of Stephen <eos> When the snow lay round about <eos> Deep and crisp and even <eos> Brightly shown the moon that night <eos> Though the frost was cruel <eos> When a poor man came in sight <eos> Gathering winter fuel <eos> Hither, page, and stand by me <eos> If thou know it telling: <eos> Yonder peasant, who is he? <eos> Where and what his dwelling? <eos> Sire, he lives a good league hence <eos> Underneath the mountain <eos> Right against the forest fence <eos> By Saint Agnes fountain <eos> Bring me flesh, and bring me wine <eos> Bring me pine logs hither <eos> Thou and I will see him dine <eos> When we bear the thither <eos> Page and monarch, forth they went <eos> Forth they went together <eos> Through the rude wind's wild lament <eos> And the bitter weather <eos> Sire, the night is darker now <eos> And the wind blows stronger <eos> Fails my heart, I know not how <eos> I can go no longer <eos> Ark my footsteps my good page <eos> Tread thou in them boldly: <eos> Thou shalt find the winter's rage <eos> Freeze thy blood less coldly <eos> In his master's step he trod <eos> Where the snow lay dented <eos> Heat was in the very sod <eos> Which the saint had printed <eos> Therefore, Christian men, be sure <eos> Wealth or rank possessing <eos> Ye who now will bless the poor <eos> Shall yourselves find blessing <eos>

We fight, we get high holdin' on to love <eos> We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us <eos> Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are? <eos> Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart? <eos> Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go? <eos> Are your tears falling down when the lights are low? <eos> Another Friday night tryna put on a show <eos> Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'? <eos> I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin <eos> So, darlin' <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin' <eos> I look around as my heart is collapsin' <eos> 'Cause you're the only one I need <eos> To put a little love on me <eos> We wrote and we wrote <eos> 'Til there were no more words <eos> We laughed and we cried <eos> Until we saw our worst <eos> Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are? <eos> Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart? <eos> Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go? <eos> Are your tears falling down when the lights are low? <eos> Another Friday night tryna put on a show <eos> Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'? <eos> I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin <eos> Will someone <eos> Put a little love on me? Ayy <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin' <eos> I look around as my heart is collapsin' <eos> 'Cause you're the only one I need <eos> To put a little love on me <eos> Last night I lay awake <eos> Stuck on the things we say <eos> And when I close my eyes <eos> The first thing I hear you say is <eos> Put a little love on me, ayy <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing <eos> I look around and you're standing there asking <eos> You say, "You're the only one I need <eos> So put your love on me" <eos> You're the only one I need <eos> Put your love on me <eos>

Teardrops <eos> We hurt ourselves for fun <eos> Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb <eos> Addicted to a lonely kind of love <eos> What I wanna know <eos> Is how we get this stressed out, paranoid <eos> Everything is going dark <eos> Nothing makes me sadder than my head <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> I'm tripping on the edge <eos> High as a kite, I'm never coming down <eos> And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels <eos> To be alone <eos> So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid? <eos> Everything is going dark <eos> Nothing makes me sadder than my head <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind <eos> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ <eos> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind <eos> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> Teardrops <eos> Teardrops <eos> I'm running outta teardrops <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos>

Vacate is the word <eos> Vengeance has no place in me to hurt <eos> Cannot find the comfort in this world <eos> Artificial tears <eos> Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers? <eos> Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere <eos> A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto <eos> But there's a trapdoor in the sun <eos> It's immortality… <eos> As privileged as a whore <eos> Victims in demand for public show <eos> Swept out through the cracks beneath the door <eos> Holier than thou, how? <eos> Surrendered, executed, anyhow… <eos> Scrawl resolved, cigar box on the floor <eos> A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto <eos> There's a trapdoor in the sun <eos> It's immortality... <eos> I cannot stop the thought running in the dark <eos> Coming up a which way sign <eos> All good truants must decide <eos> Oh, stripped and sold, mom… <eos> Auctioned forearm and whiskers in the sink <eos> Truant moves on, cannot stay long <eos> Some die just to live… <eos> Oh… <eos>

I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> I can feel that <eos> Muddy water runnin' through my veins <eos> And I can hear that <eos> Lullaby of the midnight train <eos> And it sings to me and sounds familiar <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> I can taste that honeysuckle <eos> And it's still so sweet <eos> When it grows wild <eos> On the banks down at old Camp Creek <eos> Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin' <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> It's where I learned about livin' <eos> It's where I learned about love <eos> It's where I learned about workin' hard <eos> And havin' a little was just enough <eos> It's where I learned about Jesus <eos> And knowin' where I stand <eos> You can take it or leave it <eos> This is me, this is who I am <eos> Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road <eos> And that is home to me, feels like home to me <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos>

I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks <eos> Slow movin' trains and rain <eos> I love little country streams, sleep without dreams <eos> Sunday school in May and hay <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends <eos> Birds of the world and squirrels <eos> I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups <eos> Bourbon in a glass and grass <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child <eos> Tomatoes on the vine and onions <eos> I love winners when they cry, losers when they try <eos> Music when it's good and life <eos> And I love you too <eos>

Doctor, my eyes have seen the years <eos> And the slow parade of fears without crying <eos> Now I want to understand <eos> I have done all that I could <eos> To see the evil and the good without hiding <eos> You must help me if you can <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Tell me what is wrong <eos> Was I unwise to leave them open for so long? <eos> 'Cause I have wandered through this world <eos> And as each moment has unfurled <eos> I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams <eos> People go just where they will <eos> I never noticed them until I got this feeling <eos> That it's later than it seems <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Tell me what you see <eos> I hear their cries <eos> Just say if it's too late for me <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Cannot see the sky <eos> Is this the prize <eos> For having learned how not to cry? <eos>

Just a Monday, thrift shop couch <eos> Bowl of Cheerios, it's getting dark out <eos> Clicking my remote to an episode <eos> Of Crazy Housewives <eos> And before you know <eos> I see your face on my screen <eos> That ringtone can only mean <eos> Your friends are gone <eos> You're all alone <eos> And you're thinkin' 'bout me <eos> I used to be your "6 a.m <eos> Hey good morning <eos> Beautiful, how you been?" <eos> I used to be a "we just landed <eos> Miss you, you can't stand it <eos> See you this weekend" <eos> Now I'm just a midnight number <eos> Familiar voice <eos> When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice <eos> So let it ring, let it ring all night long <eos> 'Cause I ain't your lonely call <eos> It's been three weeks and two days <eos> And twelve hours, but who's counting <eos> Ten thousand tears, feels like a year <eos> Looking for some peace, and I found it <eos> 'Cause boy you said, "Let's take a break" <eos> In the front seat of your Jeep <eos> So if you got more to say <eos> Leave a message at the beep <eos> I used to be your "6 a.m <eos> Hey good morning <eos> Beautiful, how you been?" <eos> I used to be a "we just landed <eos> Miss you, you can't stand it <eos> See you this weekend" <eos> Now I'm just a midnight number <eos> Familiar voice <eos> When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice <eos> So let it ring, let it ring all night long <eos> 'Cause I ain't your lonely call <eos> I ain't your lonely call, call, oh <eos> Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl <eos> Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl <eos> Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl <eos> Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl <eos> Let it ring, let it ring, let it ring, girl <eos> Let it ring <eos> I used to be your "6 a.m <eos> Hey good morning <eos> Beautiful, how you been?" <eos> I used to be a "we just landed <eos> Miss you, you can't stand it <eos> See you this weekend" <eos> Now I'm just a midnight number <eos> Familiar voice <eos> When you start to wonder if you made the wrong choice <eos> So let it ring, let it ring all night long <eos> 'Cause I ain't your lonely call <eos> I ain't your lonely call <eos> No, I ain't your lonely call <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 
Quarter in a payphone <eos> Drying laundry on the line <eos> Watching Sun Tea in the window <eos> Pocket watch tellin time <eos> Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette <eos> Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet <eos> If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress <eos> We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas <eos> God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be <eos> I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos> If you had something to say <eos> You'd write it on a piece of paper <eos> Then you'd put a stamp on it <eos> And they'd get it three days later <eos> Boys would call the girls <eos> And girls would turn them down <eos> Staying married was the only way to work your problems out <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos> Automatic <eos> Let's pull the windows down <eos> Windows with the cranks <eos> Come on let's take a picture <eos> The kind you gotta shake <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos>

Loving you is a mountain <eos> We don't have breath in our lungs <eos> The higher up we go is the problem <eos> So maybe we should fly to the sun <eos> I just don't believe we can function <eos> There is no life if there's an absence of blood <eos> And I don't even feel our hearts beating <eos> So maybe there is an absence of love <eos> 
If there was anyone I'd want <eos> To spend about a hundred days with <eos> Laying in the yard, staring up at stars <eos> Wondering where all the planes went <eos> It would be you, only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms, in my arms (oh-oh) <eos> And we'll leave on the news until <eos> The broadcast stops broadcasting <eos> Yes, making drinks instead of plans <eos> While the record player's blasting <eos> I sing, it would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> And when the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> If the sky turns black, if the markets crash <eos> You should check your mom's house <eos> And then you should come back <eos> Cause when it all goes down <eos> I want you by my side <eos> We could stay up till the last sunrise <eos> We could stay up until the last sunrise <eos> It would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We can keep on dancing in the dark, in the dark, in the dark <eos> It would be you till the end of the world <eos> Till the end of the world, yeah <eos> Cause if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> 
There's an hourglass sitting on the table <eos> I'm watching as everything's changing <eos> My mind goes to a different time <eos> Old love I remember falling so madly <eos> There must've been magic in the valley <eos> And a rhythm in the night <eos> 'Cause I could almost see it <eos> Did you fade right out of view <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Sometimes there's shadows growing in my mind <eos> Like a sundial in the nighttime but if i close my eyes <eos> I think I still see it <eos> Sunlight coming through <eos> CHORUS <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Oh if it takes time <eos> Where you go I'll keep on running <eos> I hope you know that I'll keep coming <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos>

Do you ever think about leaving? <eos> Do you ever think about me and you? <eos> Running to the country <eos> Where we go nothing to prove <eos> Where we can grow old with new friends <eos> Lay low on the weekends <eos> Running to the country <eos> Where we go nothing to lose <eos> 'Cause I'm tired of the busy nights <eos> Fed up with the city lights <eos> Oh, I don't wanna spend my life in this place <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause evеn cowgirls get the blues <eos> Thеre's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I wanna see a scar from a dirt road <eos> I wanna feel the air cut through my coat <eos> Seven hundred acres <eos> So many new ways to see you (To see you) <eos> And all I see is a love that we sow <eos> I can see 'em grow as we grow <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause even cowgirls get the blues <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> Getting tired of the busy nights <eos> Getting tired of the city lights <eos> Yeah, I know I can spend the rest of my life here <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause even cowgirls get the blues <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> In Montana <eos> 
Well, I guess I'm at the end again <eos> Back to breaking down on benches <eos> Guess I've grown to feel nothing <eos> And it seems nothing hurts the broken <eos> Out of everyone, I seem to be the one without <eos> Stopped waiting out for love, so shouldn't it be here by now? <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Long to feel loved, loved <eos> Maybe one to feel loved, loved <eos> I keep waiting for my lover (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> And I keep losing everyone again <eos> Maybe 'cause I haven't found myself <eos> Feels like I'm looking for nothing <eos> And nothing hurts more than not knowing <eos> Out of everyone, I seem to be the one without (Oh) <eos> Stopped waiting out for love, so shouldn't it be here by now? <eos> (By now) <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Long to feel loved, loved <eos> Maybe one to feel loved, loved <eos> I keep waiting for my lover (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> One day I might have it <eos> 'Round the corner <eos> I keep waiting for my lover <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> 
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit <eos> Been saying "yes" instead of "no" <eos> I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though <eos> I hit the ground running each night <eos> I hit the Sunday matinée <eos> You know the greatest films of all time were never made <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And if you wanted me, you really should've showed <eos> And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow <eos> And it's alright now <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> I have this dream you're doing cool shit <eos> Having adventures on your own <eos> You meet some woman on the internet and take her home <eos> We never painted by the numbers, baby <eos> But we were making it count <eos> You know the greatest loves of all time are over now <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And it's another day waking up alone <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you <eos> If one thing had been different <eos> Would everything be different today? <eos> We were something, don't you think so? <eos> Rosé flowing with your chosen family <eos> And it would've been sweet <eos> If it could've been me <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For digging up the grave another time <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> 
Weeks go so slow <eos> We haven't spoken one word <eos> Been an endless summer <eos> I go out and get home <eos> When neighbours' leaving for work <eos> I don't mind them judging <eos> I got nowhere to go <eos> Call everyone I know 'cause I go off when I'm alone <eos> Just get me drunk and hold me in the sun <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> Spending money <eos> On things I know I don't need <eos> Cut my hair to change me <eos> I'm smoking again <eos> Know how much you'd hate it <eos> But you ain't here to tell me <eos> I learned to live alone <eos> My home is not a home <eos> No, I don't feel it on my own <eos> And when I leave, I'm keepin' all lights on <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms, oh <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> I don't wanna know if you have moved on <eos> And you don't wanna know if I have met somebody new <eos> It's not as if I wanna run right back to you <eos> I just want time to pass so I'll get over you <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms, oh <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Oh, I'll get over you <eos> Oh, I'll get over you <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> 
I knew I’d have a bad time shaking you <eos> On the form, I’m naming who? <eos> With the crack sound of my tooth <eos> Coming loose <eos> It was all so complicated <eos> I didn’t mean to say it out loud <eos> Anyway then, I think I should go <eos> Exaggerate it <eos> All my heart is breaking <eos> I can’t overstate it <eos> How should I be feeling? <eos> So run the red out <eos> The ceiling is all coming down <eos> And I feel I should care but I don’t <eos> Mean to (So run the red out) <eos> Be rude (It’s all coming down) <eos> Now I feel like I’m finally me <eos> I know, I could’ve said I was feeling low <eos> But I’m here just to hold your coat <eos> I’ve been thinking I could stay at home <eos> It was all so complicated <eos> I didn’t mean to say it out loud <eos> Anyway then, I think I should go <eos> Exaggerate it <eos> All my heart is breaking <eos> I can’t overstate it <eos> How should I be feeling? <eos> So run the red out <eos> The ceiling is all coming down <eos> And I feel I should care but I don’t <eos> Mean to (So run the red out) <eos> Be rude (It’s all coming down) <eos> Now I feel like I’m finally me <eos> 
Tell her a story <eos> Tell her the honest truth <eos> You treat her better <eos> Make sure to see it through <eos> Don't be just everything she wants <eos> Be everything she needs <eos> When she says she loves you <eos> Tell her you love her too <eos> Give her a reason <eos> Reason to love all you do <eos> She'll tell you secrets <eos> You'll tell her secrets too <eos> She'll tell you all her hopes and dreams <eos> You'll tell them too <eos> When she says she loves you <eos> Tell her you love her too <eos> Tell her you love her too <eos> But don't you run away, run away <eos> When you get tired <eos> 'Cause this will slip away, slip away <eos> And start a fire <eos> That can never be put out <eos> Oh, hurry, time is running out <eos> But don't you run away, run away <eos> Before you tell her you love her <eos> When she says she needs you <eos> Tell her you need her too <eos> You tell her clearly <eos> Speak what your heart wants you to <eos> Tell her she's lovely <eos> Always tell her the truth <eos> When she says she loves you <eos> Tell her you love her too <eos> But please don't run away, run away <eos> When you get tired <eos> 'Cause this will slip away, slip away <eos> And start a fire <eos> That can never be put out <eos> Oh, hurry, time is running out <eos> But don't you run away, run away <eos> Before you tell her you love her <eos> You love her <eos> 
I'm not gonna make this easy, here comes the goodbye <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Take a bath in all the sorrow and enjoy the sight <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I'm takin' a picture of this in the back of my mind <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I know when I really need to I can close my eyes <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> I remember the way you look at all the gates you've been assigned <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Just let me know when you land, only then I'll be fine <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> This won't be the last time <eos> One day we're both gonna look back, laugh at how much we cried <eos> 'Cause every time we left I thought that it would be the last time <eos> 
I hate you for what you did <eos> And I miss you like a little kid <eos> I faked it every time <eos> But that's alright <eos> I can hardly feel anything <eos> I hardly feel anything at all <eos> You gave me fifteen hundred <eos> To see your hypnotherapist <eos> I only went one time <eos> You let it slide <eos> Fell on hard times a year ago <eos> Was hoping you would let it go, and you did <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> Somebody roll the windows down <eos> There are no words in the English language <eos> I could scream to drown you out <eos> I'm on the outside looking through <eos> You're throwing rocks around your room <eos> And while you're bleeding on your back <eos> In the glass <eos> I'll be glad that I made it out <eos> And sorry that it all went down like it did <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> Somebody roll the windows down <eos> There are no words in the English language <eos> I could scream to drown you out <eos> Hey, why do you sing with an English accent? <eos> I guess it's too late to change it now <eos> You know I'm never gonna let you have it <eos> But I will try to drown you out <eos> You said when you met me, you were bored <eos> You said when you met me, you were bored <eos> And you, you were in a band when I was born <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> I try to stay clean and live without <eos> And I want to know what would happen <eos> If I surrender to the sound <eos> Surrender to the sound <eos> 
I saw you in a dream <eos> You had stayed the same <eos> You were beckoning me <eos> Said that I had changed <eos> Tried to keep my eyes closed <eos> I want you so bad <eos> Then I awoke and it was so sad <eos> Haven't talked to you in months <eos> And I thought that I might cry <eos> But I'm not that kind of guy <eos> I saw you in a dream <eos> You came to me <eos> You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision <eos> There was no reason, no explanation <eos> The perfect hallucination <eos> All good things come to an end <eos> But I thought that this might last <eos> But you came and left so fast <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> (It isn't the same but it is enough) <eos> I saw you in a dream <eos> Then it came to an end <eos> I wonder if you'll come and visit me again <eos> You're taking your time to reappear <eos> I'm starting to believe that when I call your name <eos> You just don't hear me anymore <eos> And I know that I shouldn't even try <eos> It's a waste of time <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> (It isn't the same but it is enough) <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> 
Hello <eos> There's a place <eos> I've been going <eos> There's a place I've been going <eos> Now I'm clean <eos> It would seem <eos> Let's go somewhere I'll be seen <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> I seen Greg and he was like <eos> "I seen your friends at the birthday party <eos> They were kinda fucked up before it even started <eos> They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show <eos> They didn't know about all the weird stuff <eos> So they just left it" (So they just left it) <eos> I was wasted (I was wasted) <eos> And cold <eos> And minding my business <eos> And I seen the girls and they were all like <eos> "Do you wanna come and get fucked up?" <eos> Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing <eos> "No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid <eos> It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it" <eos> "This ain't going well" <eos> I thought that I was stuck in Hell <eos> In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel <eos> About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well <eos> You pulled away when I went in for the kiss <eos> No, it wasn't a diss <eos> You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss <eos> After four years, don't you think I'm over all this? <eos> "That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room <eos> He's gotta share for a bit" <eos> You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby <eos> To get things that they don't have <eos> Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya? <eos> You know that I could sue ya if we're married <eos> And you fuck up again <eos> Impress myself with stealth and bad health <eos> And my wealth and progressive causes <eos> Then drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha <eos> Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it <eos> Look, the fucking state of it <eos> I came pretty late to it <eos> We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture <eos> All your friends <eos> In one place <eos> Oh, we're a scene <eos> Whatever that means <eos> I depend <eos> On my friends <eos> To stay clean <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> As sad as it seems (Alright) <eos> As sad as it seems (Come on) <eos> 
Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Who was I? <eos> Who were you when I loved you? <eos> Babe, it's you <eos> I don't think I know <eos> I was different but you were too <eos> Matching socks and old cartoons <eos> Wish those days never changed <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Oh, I want you <eos> Do you want me back? <eos> Oh, I need you <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> 
Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> Cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Tip-toeing ‘round in space (out of control, out of control) <eos> Do the dash, do the race <eos> Throw the cash in their face <eos> On the moon but out of phase (out of control, out of control) <eos> City map, locate, Double back rotate <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Command V copy and paste (copy and paste, copy and paste) <eos> Command me, set the pace (set the pace) <eos> Wanna link for your chain ? <eos> Grass on ground, rough terrain <eos> You man lounge, I’m detained <eos> So profound and too mundane <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Ring ring ring on my phone <eos> Hot hot hot on my own, on my own <eos> Eclipse just some fresh to my breath (ey) <eos> Everybody knows I’m a mess (ey) <eos> Pressed for a breath, I confess (ey) <eos> Leave me dead <eos> I step with disruption, sometimes I stride with some pride or corruption <eos> Find myself at a junction, looking both ways man I’ve run out of options <eos> Seeing the figures, I choose to ignore them <eos> If them seems important it’s blown out of proportion <eos> Moving with caution, I’m closer to satellites that are in orbit <eos> Flown overseas I’m in-doors I’m exhausted <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> 
She would never say where she came from <eos> Yesterday don't matter if it's gone <eos> While the sun is bright <eos> Or in the darkest night <eos> No one knows <eos> She comes and goes <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> Don't question why she needs to be so free <eos> She'll tell you it's the only way to be <eos> She just can't be chained <eos> To a life where nothing's gained <eos> And nothing's lost <eos> At such a cost <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> "There's no time to lose," I heard her say <eos> "Catch your dreams before they slip away <eos> Dying all the time <eos> Lose your dreams and you <eos> Will lose your mind <eos> Ain't life unkind?" <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> 
If you’re travelin' in the north country fair <eos> Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline <eos> Remember me to one who lives there <eos> For she once was a true love of mine <eos> If you go when the snowflakes storm <eos> When the rivers freeze and summer ends <eos> Please see if she has a coat so warm <eos> To keep her from the howling winds <eos> Please see if her hair hangs long <eos> If it rolls and flows all down her breast <eos> Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long <eos> For that’s the way I remember her best <eos> I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all <eos> Many times I’ve often prayed <eos> In the darkness of my night <eos> In the brightness of my day <eos> So if you’re travelin' the north country fair <eos> Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline <eos> Remember me to one who lives there <eos> For she once was a true love of mine <eos> 
First Field Mob break up, now every day I wake up <eos> Feel the pressure coming down on me <eos> Know I wrote a thousand rhymes, somethin' like a thousand times <eos> I promise I got it, just put it all on Steve <eos> We ratchet and righteous, no, I ain’t forgot it <eos> How shawties would want me, ignoring all of my mileage <eos> We were losing our homies, we were dropping out college <eos> We were losing our way, just hoping that we could find it but look <eos> This that Holy Bible in a Gucci bag <eos> Word to Soulo Ho, might catch the holy coach <eos> Looking for my father, wonder where he at <eos> Still pray I never see you down, boy, that's a Holy Ghost <eos> Run it back, biking to the park or to the corner store <eos> J&J, Mama hit the grind and got us out the hood <eos> Where we at? Home of Ray Charles' mama and dreams <eos> From the minors to the show, homie, welcome to the league <eos> People love, people lie <eos> Grab the wheel, take a ride <eos> It’s you and yours, it's me and mine <eos> The memories, they never die <eos> No straight line and it's okay <eos> 'Cause you gon' find that they might fade, but <eos> The memories, they never die, the memories, they never die <eos> I lost my voice, still I'm the voice of the city <eos> I got it back, I'm a national treasure and God sent me <eos> It's God-written, I’ve been scribed in hieroglyphics <eos> My mind busy, the stressing, I clip it like Doc Rivers <eos> Gotta practice patience <eos> Youngins looking at me, I been grabbing spaceships <eos> Usher in my partners like we trading places <eos> We don’t forget the basics <eos> Had to fix the vision like I went and got Lasik <eos> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the fairest of 'em all? <eos> Who ain’t never hit a lick, who ain't had that karma call? <eos> Who ain't try to study Big? Who ain't try to study Nas? <eos> Who ain’t try to study Jay in hopes that I would never fall? <eos> Yeah, aspire to inspire <eos> Chasing all my desires, follow me through the fire <eos> Swimming through troubled waters, do away with my idols <eos> Hoping we never grow up, still repeating the cycle <eos> People love, people lie <eos> Grab the wheel, take a ride <eos> It's you and yours, it's me and mine <eos> The memories, they never die <eos> No straight line and it's okay <eos> 'Cause you gon' find that they might fade, but <eos> The memories, they never die, the memories, they never die <eos>

Try to do right by your body <eos> But your body says it can't make up its mind <eos> Singing the song of your body <eos> But the melody is changing all the time <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> And when the blood runs <eos> And you wonder if you're ringing like a bell <eos> You can have your fun <eos> But you'll never know if you danced for yourself <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> Try to do right by your body <eos> But it's always taking bidders on the side <eos> There at the end with it <eos> But your body falls to pieces and you look to the sky <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> So you stand at thе window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They arе waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how <eos> 
If you wake up someday soon <eos> In a great big house, in a new bedroom <eos> If you get to thinkin' 'bout the passing of time <eos> Circumstances, years are strange <eos> The same old people have new last names <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still loving you the best that I can <eos> If some weekend evening, your kind new man <eos> At a black tie party, he takes your hand <eos> If you make your entrance in that dress that I liked <eos> If sometime later, you should meet <eos> Some quiet stranger who talks like me <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> 
Have it all, rip our memories off the wall <eos> All the special things I bought <eos> They mean nothing to me anymore <eos> But to you, they were everything we were <eos> They meant more than every word <eos> Now I know just what you love me for <eos> Take all the money you want from me <eos> Hope you become what you want to be <eos> Show me how little you care <eos> How little you care, how little you care <eos> You dream of glitter and gold <eos> My heart's already been sold <eos> Show you how little I care <eos> How little I care, how little I care <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> You’re never gonna hear my heart break <eos> Never gonna move in dark ways <eos> Baby, you're so cruel <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Material love won't fool me <eos> When you’re not here, I can't breathe <eos> Think I always knew <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Shake it off, shake the fear of feeling lost <eos> Always me that pays the cost <eos> I should never trust so easily <eos> You lied to me, lied to me <eos> Then left with my heart 'round your chest <eos> Take all the money you want from me <eos> Hope you become what you want to be <eos> Show me how little you care <eos> How little you care, how little you care <eos> You dream of glitter and gold <eos> My heart's already been sold <eos> Show you how little I care <eos> How little I care, how little I care <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> You're never gonna hear my heart break <eos> Never gonna move in dark ways <eos> Baby, you're so cruel <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Material love won't fool me <eos> When you're not here, I can’t breathe <eos> Think I always knew <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Woah-oh, woah-oh <eos> Always knew <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Woah-oh, woah-oh <eos> Always knew <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> You’re never gonna hear my heart break <eos> Never gonna move in dark ways <eos> Baby, you're so cruel <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> Material love won’t fool me <eos> When you're not here, I can't breathe <eos> Think I always knew <eos> My diamonds leave with you <eos> 
Pop the cork on yesterday's wine <eos> 'Cause I don't feel like going out tonight <eos> Let's spin a couple of forty-fives <eos> And order some Chinese takeout <eos> Do the dishes and turn down the lights <eos> Watch West Side Story for the eighteenth time <eos> I couldn't think of a better way to spend my Friday night <eos> No cover charge or taxicabs <eos> C'mon, baby, what do you say? <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> I'm more about the right here, right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Never cared much for fancy champagne <eos> Unpronounceable fancy French names <eos> I'd much rather just sit on the couch and make out <eos> Mmm, it's been a long hard week <eos> And I don't want nothing but you holding me <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> I'm more about the right here, right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date, hey <eos> Come a little closer baby <eos> Let me be your cheap date <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> No, I'm more about the you and me, right here and right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Ooh, I'll be your cheap date <eos> 
Sometimes I think about the ones that we’ve replaced <eos> All the millions underneath the burnt and waste <eos> And I get sad because, of course, we’ll be the same <eos> All of history collapsing in its wake <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> I heard that someday when they look up at the night <eos> They’ll see nothing but a black and starless sky <eos> And they’ll tell stories of some old and callow time <eos> Claiming spectacles of brilliant burning lights <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> So maybe this is what it takes to realize <eos> I am grateful just that I have been alive <eos> And I’ll be happy if I look back on my life <eos> Been a sister, been a mother, been a wife <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> 
I've been falling for her <eos> While you've been falling for me <eos> You're asking for the space in my heart <eos> But my heart is no longer with me <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could dry your eyes <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> It could be easy <eos> If I could split my heart right into three <eos> For you, for her, for me <eos> I don't love you <eos> Any less than before <eos> But I can't love you anymore <eos> There are times I can't see us apart <eos> But even a broken clock is right twice a day <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could dry your eyes <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> It could be easy <eos> If I could split my heart right into three <eos> For you, for her, for me <eos> What's the point in having part of a heart <eos> When the rest is left to bleed? <eos> But maybe some <eos> Will be better than none <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could split it into three <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> I wish I could split my heart <eos> For me, for her, for you <eos> For me, for her, for you <eos> 
My cousin is in Colombia <eos> Hunting down the rebels <eos> Over fields of bright and shiny coca <eos> Over the jungle floor <eos> One-handing a 32 <eos> He says: "bring her down low now, I'm ready to go." <eos> "I hunt kids in camouflage <eos> Rain down bullets in flight, white light <eos> Barefoot boys run for your lives." <eos> But you can't be nice <eos> You put your gun to their head <eos> And you pull back the pin <eos> And you can't be good <eos> My friend is based in Afghanistan <eos> He goes from cave to cave and pulls the trigger <eos> At the first sight of a man <eos> It's total anarchy <eos> Shooting tracer bullets at night <eos> A high and holy patrol into poppy fields <eos> But you can't be good <eos> You hold up the bloody knife <eos> And let it shine in the sun <eos> You gotta be everywhere <eos> I'm a guard in Guantanamo <eos> I bring the prisoners in <eos> The hoods come off and torture slowly begins <eos> The screams I've overheard <eos> It'd fuck up a weaker man <eos> But I'm cold, I'm so untouchable <eos> And you can't be nice <eos> I got a flak jacket <eos> On my soul with me tonight <eos> And you can't be good <eos>

Follow me, follow me, follow me, my supernova <eos> Going up, going up, going up til you burst to flames <eos> Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around for no one <eos> The way you make it so hard for me to say a goodbye <eos> I think I want to be around you for the rest of my life <eos> I’m just living in the moment <eos> Having good times, I’ll be moving with the motion for once in my life <eos> Follow me, follow me, follow me, my supernova <eos> Going up, going up, going up til you burst to flames <eos> Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around for no one <eos> Keep on blasting through girl <eos> The way you make it so hard for me to say a goodbye <eos> I think I want to be around you for the rest of my life <eos> I’m just living in the moment <eos> Having good times, I’ll be moving with the motion for once in my life <eos> Follow me, follow me, follow me, my supernova <eos> 
You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Oh, oh you said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Did you want me at home more? <eos> Was I runnin' around more than you liked, me leavin' you? <eos> Did you want more alone time? <eos> Was I callin' you up every night when I needed you? <eos> Times that I was tired and selfish <eos> I don't know why I did it, I couldn't help it <eos> But you know that I've tried <eos> Now I keep on askin', could I? <eos> Could I? <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Oh-oh you said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Memories twist the light <eos> I know you're thinkin' tonight about the things I did right <eos> But seein' you so happy now <eos> Has got me thinkin' about all the things I did wrong <eos> Times that I was quiet and distant <eos> I don't know why I didn't tell you what I meant <eos> But you know that I've tried <eos> Now I keep on askin', could I? <eos> Could I? <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> There must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> 
When we're all alone and the night has falled <eos> And lost in what each other needs <eos> When the silence echoes our nervous hearts <eos> And all is just the way we feel <eos> I can't hide it, shouldn't fight <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And loose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> You  shy away, you was afraid <eos> To give into something so real <eos> Allow desire to rule your head <eos> Get lost in what we feel <eos> You can't hide it shouldn't fight it <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And lose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> 
You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair <eos> Tellin' me how well you used to dance <eos> The western wind will come again <eos> And make you feel like you did <eos> When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance <eos> Said his life took most of you <eos> Gave you twice and the day was through <eos> You said it all turned out awfully fair <eos> So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by <eos> Breathin' in that cold November air <eos> No one was there <eos> No one was there <eos> When no one was there <eos> Two kids 'bout 23, when the sun sets you'll never see <eos> You were yellin' "Supper" from the yard <eos> And they grew old and sailed away <eos> Call you on phones from far away <eos> Wrote you novels on postcards <eos> And all you ever wanted was to see your children fly <eos> Maybe one day they're stars <eos> But there ain't no leavin' this small town this evenin' <eos> You can't even drive your own car <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Dear Mama, how's it goin'? <eos> Was the weather fair last week? <eos> Dear Mama, they were wonderful <eos> All the sights you'll never see <eos> And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms <eos> Tell you what it means <eos> You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats <eos> And make him mean something <eos> Tell us what you wanted to, and all we did, we needed you <eos> Your dreams were too small to care <eos> But I'm always reminded, if you look hard you'll find it <eos> Memory gives warmth to right here <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Dear Mama, how's it goin'? <eos> Was the weather fair last week? <eos> Dear Mama, they were wonderful <eos> All the sights you'll never see <eos> And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms <eos> Tell you what it means <eos> You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats <eos> And make him mean something <eos> You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair <eos> Tellin' me how well you used to dance <eos> The western wind will come again <eos> And make you feel like you did <eos> When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance <eos> 
In this autumn town where the leaves can fall <eos> On either side of the garden wall <eos> We laugh all night to keep the embers glowing <eos> Some are leaping free from their moving cars <eos> Stacking stones 'round their broken hearts <eos> Waving down any wind that might come blowing <eos> Mice move out when the field is cut <eos> Serpents curl when the sun comes up <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> Some get rain and some get snow <eos> Some want love and some want gold <eos> I just want to see you in the morning <eos> Dogs lay down in the evening heat <eos> Fish do worse when they leave the sea <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> In this autumn town where the lights can change <eos> Some get mercy and some get blame <eos> Some get lost when they feel the river flowing <eos> It's all holy smoke and the flame dies fast <eos> We hold our hats while the days fly past <eos> Cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going <eos> Fathers, Sons and Holy Ghosts <eos> All come back or they all come close <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> Some get hard and some go home <eos> Some want flesh and some want bone <eos> I just want to see you in the morning <eos> Yeah, I just want to see you in the morning <eos> 
It was a crawdad spring and a grasshopper summer <eos> I had a dime store daddy and a paperback mother <eos> Sister had a boyfriend and brother was playing ball <eos> And I was raising myself, the last of them all <eos> So I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> There was a party going on with nobody home <eos> No one to mind me, or looking to find me <eos> I was outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> I was a California dreamer in a hot Texas town <eos> And I was too young to drive but I still got around <eos> Climbing out of windows just to get stoned <eos> Out there on the edge swimming alone <eos> But I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> I was always running away from home <eos> But on my side was my heart open wide <eos> I learned how to survive swimming alone <eos> Yeah <eos> I've had friends and lovers and so many others <eos> I've had a lot of good deals and plans that I broke <eos> Sometimes you get burned but that's how you learn <eos> When you're out there in the world swimming alone <eos> So I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> Don't bother calling 'cause I won't pick up the phone <eos> Baby don't mind me, you know where to find me <eos> I'm outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> I'll be outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> 
Me and Louise never had much luck <eos> Just a couple of kids with a lot of love <eos> Laid our fortunes on her daddy's old farm <eos> Didn't see how dirt could do such harm <eos> Seasons came and the seasons left <eos> The only thing that changed was the shape of her dress <eos> She said: you're a good man, you'll have my child <eos> You can't raise a living a thing on this cursëd old ground <eos> We laid a sheet on the piano keys <eos> Crying good lord, please, please <eos> Packed our things into the old farm car <eos> Wondering if it could take us very far <eos> And I said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> Out here on the borderline the sun sets low <eos> Like a couple of jackrabbits dancing in the morning snow <eos> Knew we'd make it, if we could just get out <eos> The only thing we saw was love in sow <eos> Miles came and the miles went <eos> Our hearts full - our money spent <eos> Somewhere outside El Paso my Louise cried out <eos> She took my arm - said, "It's time now" <eos> I prayed and waited all night <eos> Oh Louise, please, please <eos> I heard a new voice with the new day <eos> I thought back to what her Daddy used to say <eos> And he said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> Then me and Louise didn't go too far <eos> We named our boy for Louise's pa <eos> Found a plot of ground we could call our own <eos> We built a house - we built a home <eos> And we said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> Louise <eos>

I’m going back to the farm <eos> Where the starry night skies roll on and on <eos> I’m going back to my ancestry <eos> Gonna find out a little more about what made me <eos> When Madeleine was 26 <eos> She was given a daisy chain made with love <eos> She kept that daisy chain in her jewelry box <eos> To this day the chain remains unbroken <eos> I’m going back to the southern shores <eos> Gonna run along my favourite beaches with my dog <eos> And I will miss you ‘til the day I die <eos> But I find comfort knowing I can see you in the sky <eos> I’m going back to the farm <eos> Where the brilliant sunrise wakes me from my sleep <eos> Knowing I still have a million miles to run <eos> And a million songs still to be sung <eos> I’m going back to the farm I tell ya <eos> Where the starry night skies roll on & on into November and all year <eos> Tonight we’re gonna sing songs of hope and joy <eos> And be thankful for what we’ve learned along the way <eos> And be thankful for what we’ve learned along the way <eos> The moon, the sun, the laughter and the tears <eos> We find comfort knowing you’ll always be near <eos> Each link in the chain holds strong and true <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos> 
If I tell you, if I tell you now <eos> Will you keep on <eos> Will you keep on loving me? <eos> If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel <eos> Will you keep on bringing out the best in me? <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> And it never felt like this before <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> That is you <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> And it never felt this hot before <eos> Giving me something that's taboo <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> You've got the biggest heart <eos> Sometimes I think you're just too good for me <eos> Every day is Christmas and every night is New Year's Eve <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> Only the sweetest <eos> Only the sweetest <eos> 
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> When I met you <eos> I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around <eos> Into someone new <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> It's much too late to find <eos> You think you've changed your mind <eos> You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Oh-oh, mm <eos> Mm-mm-mm, mm <eos> I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> That much is true <eos> But even then I knew I'd find a much bettеr place <eos> With or without you <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't beliеve it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh-oh? <eos> Ooh <eos> 
Baby blue bandana drives by in a pickup truck <eos> Got a white stripe right down the side, tires on the mud <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> Stand up on my shoulders <eos> And tell me, darling, what can you see? <eos> Ten thousand holy rollers going to battle <eos> Cigarettes tucked up in their sleeves <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of lovе and I'll obey her evеry word <eos> We take our loving on the run quite seriously <eos> I'm wondering if she's got a gun hidden up her sleeve <eos> Now stand up on my shoulders <eos> And tell me, honey, what can you see? <eos> Ten thousand holy rollers <eos> Going to battle, plain white tees <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> Every word, every word, start a fire <eos> Baby blue, baby blue <eos> 
Call me when the storms are closing in <eos> And let me hold you then <eos> Fall into the arms of this old home <eos> And let me drink you in <eos> Lay your troubles down beside my door <eos> Come and rest with me <eos> Where the light is there is dark no more <eos> Close your eyes with me <eos> The world is quietly below <eos> And you are free with me <eos> I can see you wanting to let go <eos> And let it be <eos> Let it be <eos> I will walk you to the water’s edge <eos> Feel alive again <eos> And listen to the song inside the wind <eos> And we will dance again <eos> The world is quietly below <eos> And you are free with me <eos> I can see you wanting to let go <eos> And let it be <eos> Let it be <eos> Let it be <eos> Oh let it be <eos> Call me when the storms are closing in <eos> And let me hold you then <eos> 
How can I rearrange <eos> And put it on the page <eos> When the enemy's at the door <eos> And there's nothing you can do they've never seen before <eos> And everybody knows <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> I can see a fire from a mile away <eos> 'Cause nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> If I could reach you now <eos> I'd say that I am proud <eos> Of everything you've done <eos> And the wonderful man I know you have become <eos> 'Cause maybe you don't know <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> Tell me that you love me when you're miles away <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Loneliness is on the dawn <eos> Loving is a line <eos> I saw it on the sign <eos> It's a line to drag you in <eos> It's false advertising <eos> And no one wants to say <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> I can see a fire from a mile away <eos> 'Cause nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> 
Danger danger <eos> I can read your mind <eos> Wouldn’t change it <eos> ‘Cus I fall this way <eos> And feels so right <eos> Yeah it all feels right <eos> I can’t believe that I would ever stand so close to you <eos> It doesn’t matter where this ends up, I ain’t leaving <eos> Know what I’m doing, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> I try to act like it ain’t ever gonna bother me <eos> But when you talk like that you make it feel so easy <eos> Know where I’m headed, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no, ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back oh I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos>

The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken <eos> I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold <eos> In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot <eos> I willed the car to start to bring me home to you <eos> Oh, lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview <eos> To wish back an image of myself I thought was true <eos> So now when colors fade and on that day of days <eos> I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue <eos> Oh, and lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes <eos> Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit <eos> And I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken <eos> Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big <eos> But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met <eos> You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago <eos> There was something about you I struggled to forget <eos> My blood was rushing down to you <eos> You were leadin’ me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse <eos> 'Cause you're a wanderer too <eos> 
Hey, everything must always start again. That's how it goes my little Mickey Finn <eos> They rob you and they kick you when you're out like a light, I know it's happening <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> Give me something, Bloomsday's coming, open up the doors and have a goddamn beer <eos> Ring the baker, the butcher, the charioteer, the palm readers in Salem, the engineer <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> So are you a socialite, do you buy candles to pricey now to light? <eos> Or are you an Okie from Okmulgee just making due with wax and pride? <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> 
Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring <eos> Oh but I know love as a fading thing <eos> Just as fickle as a feather in a stream <eos> See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me <eos> It put its face up to my face so I could see <eos> Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me <eos> Into something I am not recognizing <eos> You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ <eos> I will not open myself up this way again <eos> I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand <eos> I will not lay like this for days now upon end <eos> You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand <eos> To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand <eos> You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ <eos> I will not open myself up this way again <eos> You see the moon is bright in that treetop night <eos> I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light <eos> Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white <eos> And we race out on the desert plains all night <eos> See honey, I am not some broken thing <eos> I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee <eos> No my heart is gold and my feet are light <eos> And I am racing out on the desert plains all night <eos> Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring <eos> Oh but I know love as a caging thing <eos> Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream <eos> Ah and all you folks, you come to see <eos> You just stand there in the glass looking at me <eos> But my heart is wild and my bones are steam <eos> And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free <eos> 
Don't go changin' <eos> To try and please me <eos> You never let me down before, mmm <eos> Don't imagine <eos> You're too familiar <eos> And I don't see you anymore <eos> I would not leave you <eos> In times of trouble <eos> We never could have come this far, mmm <eos> I took the good times <eos> I'll take the bad times <eos> I'll take you just the way you are <eos> Don't go tryin' <eos> Some new fashion <eos> Don't change the color of your hair, mmm mmm <eos> You always have my <eos> Unspoken passion <eos> Although I might not seem to care <eos> I don't want clever <eos> Conversation <eos> I never want to work that hard <eos> I just want someone <eos> That I can talk to <eos> I want you just the way you are <eos> I need to know that you will always be <eos> The same old someone that I knew <eos> Ahh, what will it take 'til you believe in me <eos> The way that I believe in you <eos> I said I love you <eos> And that's forever <eos> And this I promise from the heart, mmm mmm <eos> I couldn't love you <eos> Any better <eos> I love you just the way you are <eos> Right! <eos> 3:04 - 3:29 <eos> I don't want clever <eos> Conversation <eos> I never want to work that hard, mmm-mm <eos> I just want someone <eos> That I can talk to <eos> I want you just the way you are, ohh <eos> 
You sheltered me from harm <eos> Kept me warm, kept me warm <eos> You gave my life to me <eos> Set me free, set me free <eos> The finest years I ever knew <eos> Were all the years I had with you <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> You taught me how to love <eos> What it's of, what it's of <eos> You never said too much <eos> But still you showed the way <eos> And I knew from watching you <eos> Nobody else could ever know <eos> The part of me that can't let go <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> Is there someone you know <eos> You're loving them so <eos> But taking them all for granted? <eos> You may lose them one day <eos> Someone takes them away <eos> And they don't hear the words <eos> You long to say <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> Just to touch you once again <eos> 
When you're weary <eos> Feeling small <eos> When tears are in your eyes <eos> I will dry them all <eos> I'm on your side <eos> When times get rough <eos> And friends just can't be found <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> When you're down and out <eos> When you're on the street <eos> When evening falls so hard <eos> I will comfort you <eos> I'll take your part <eos> When darkness comes <eos> And pain is all around <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Sail on Silver Girl <eos> Sail on by <eos> Your time has come to shine <eos> All your dreams are on their way <eos> See how they shine, oh <eos> If you need a friend <eos> I'm sailing right behind <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will ease your mind <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will ease your mind <eos> 
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane <eos> I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain <eos> Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye <eos> God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been <eos> And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen <eos> Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough <eos> Lord, I miss Daniel <eos> Oh, I miss him so much <eos> Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me <eos> Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? <eos> Your eyes have died, but you see more than I <eos> Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky <eos> Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me <eos> Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? <eos> Your eyes have died, but you see more than I <eos> Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky <eos> Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane <eos> I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain <eos> Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye <eos> God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> Oh God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> 
Hey, have you ever tried <eos> Really reaching out for the other side? <eos> I may be climbing on rainbows <eos> But baby, here goes <eos> Dreams <eos> They're for those who sleep <eos> Life is for us to keep <eos> And if you're wondering <eos> What this all is leading to <eos> I want to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos> No, you don't know me well <eos> And every little thing <eos> Only time will tell <eos> If you believe the things that I do <eos> And we'll see it through <eos> Life can be short or long <eos> Love can be right or wrong <eos> And if I chose the one <eos> I'd like to help me through <eos> I'd like to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos> 2:03 - 2:26 <eos> Baby, you know that <eos> Dreams <eos> They're for those who sleep <eos> Life, it's for us to keep <eos> And if I chose the one <eos> I'd like to help me through <eos> I'd like to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos> 
Let's be chameleons <eos> You're a sister, I needed more <eos> Once the war fought the storm <eos> And I thought the light would beam <eos> Write the words on the shore <eos> Give a signal when we breathe <eos> Let the wheels take the fall <eos> The wheels take the fall <eos> When I'm cold, you shake <eos> I see you in the morning in a myriad ways <eos> I'm all for yours to keep <eos> I'm all for yours to keep <eos>

Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole <eos> N'aria serena doppo na tempesta! <eos> Pe'II'aria fresca pare già na festa! <eos> Che bella cosa na iurnata 'e sole! <eos> Ma n'atu sole <eos> Cchiu bello, oje <eos> 'o sole mio <eos> Sta 'nfronte a te! <eos> 'O sole, 'o sole mio <eos> Sta nfronte a te <eos> Sta nfronte a te! <eos> Quanno fa notte e' sole se ne scenne <eos> Mme vene quase 'na malincunia; <eos> Sotto 'a fenesta toia restarria <eos> Quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne <eos> Ma n'atu sole, ecc <eos> 
When the cold of winter comes <eos> Starless night will cover day <eos> In the veiling of the sun <eos> We will walk in bitter rain <eos> But in dreams (But in dreams) <eos> I can hear your name <eos> And in dreams (And in dreams) <eos> We will meet again <eos> When the seas and mountains fall <eos> And we come, to end of days <eos> In the dark I hear a call <eos> Calling me there <eos> I will go there <eos> And back again <eos> 
I know it ain't all that late <eos> But you should probably leave <eos> I recognize that look in your eyes <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> You want me to say that I want you to stay <eos> So you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> There's still time for you to finish your wine <eos> Then you should probably leave <eos> And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss <eos> Then you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> You want me to say that I want you to stay <eos> So you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> Like a devil on my shoulder you keep whisperin' in my ear <eos> And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here <eos> I wanna do the right thing, baby <eos> Sun on your skin, 6AM <eos> And I been watchin' you sleep <eos> And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say <eos> That you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> I want you to stay but you'll probably say <eos> That you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> Oh, you should probably leave <eos> 
When the sun goes down on my side of town <eos> That lonesome feelin' comes to my door <eos> And the whole world turns <eos> Blue <eos> There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks <eos> I've got a table for two, way in the back <eos> Where I sit alone <eos> And think of losin' you <eos> I spend most every night <eos> Beneath the light of a neon moon <eos> Now if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free <eos> I close my eyes and sometimes see <eos> You in the shadows <eos> Of this smoke-filled room <eos> No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried <eos> Or how many lies that I've lied <eos> Tellin' my poor heart <eos> She'll come back someday <eos> Oh, but I'll be alright <eos> As long as there's light from a neon moon <eos> Oh, if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> The jukebox plays on, drink by drink <eos> And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think <eos> And this hurt inside of me <eos> Ain't never gonna end <eos> Oh, but I'll be alright <eos> As long as there's light from a neon moon <eos> Oh, if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams <eos> Of a neon moon <eos> Come watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> Oh, watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> 
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while? <eos> Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside <eos> Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone <eos> 'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know <eos> Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said <eos> Just 'cause I'm leavin' <eos> It don't mean that I won't be right by your side <eos> When you need me <eos> And you can't see me in the middle of the night <eos> Just close your eyes and say a prayer <eos> It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here <eos> But I'll always be right there <eos> Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere <eos> Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait <eos> He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away <eos> I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut <eos> 'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough <eos> Before I left, he hugged my neck and said <eos> Just 'cause you're leavin' <eos> It don't mean that I won't be right by your side <eos> When you need me <eos> And you can't see me in the middle of the night <eos> Just close your eyes and say a prayer <eos> It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here <eos> But I'll always be right there <eos> Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere <eos> Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while? <eos> I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye <eos> Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own <eos> There's no way that I can walk this road alone <eos> Daddy grabbed my hand and said <eos> Just 'cause I'm leavin' <eos> It don't mean that I won't be right by your side <eos> When you need me <eos> And you can't see me in the middle of the night <eos> Just close your eyes and say a prayer <eos> It's okay, boy, I ain't scared <eos> I won't be here, but I'll always be right there <eos> Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere <eos> I ain't goin' nowhere <eos>

In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town <eos> Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all around <eos> And all the girls from there to Austin <eos> Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelry in hock <eos> To take a trip to go and listen to the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Well he couldn't ride or wrangle <eos> And he never cared to make a dime <eos> But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time <eos> And all the girls from nine to ninety <eos> Were snappin' fingers, tappin' toes, and beggin' him "don't stop" <eos> And hypnotized and fascinated by the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him 'round <eos> He vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town <eos> But all the girls still dreamed about him <eos> And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked <eos> And then one day on the Hit Parade was a little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> 
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman <eos> Giving all your love to just one man <eos> You'll have bad times <eos> And he'll have good times <eos> Doin' things that you don't understand <eos> But if you love him <eos> You'll forgive him <eos> Even though he's hard to understand <eos> And if you love him <eos> Oh, be proud of him <eos> 'Cause after all, he's just a man <eos> Stand by your man <eos> Give him two arms to cling to <eos> And something warm to come to <eos> When nights are cold and lonely <eos> Stand by your man <eos> And show the world you love him <eos> Keep giving all the love you can <eos> Stand by your man <eos> Stand by your man <eos> And show the world you love him <eos> Keep giving all the love you can <eos> Stand by your man <eos>

Well, we were down in Austin, Texas <eos> At the Hang 'em High Saloon <eos> Hitting the bars, pickin' on guitars <eos> And singin' out country tunes <eos> When some third-string Longhorn quarterback <eos> Said he wanted a piece of Wade <eos> Well, when it's two for one <eos> It's one for all <eos> So I jumped down off that stage <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm bulletproof <eos> Ten feet tall when I'm drinkin' <eos> Get to thinkin' that I'm Superman <eos> So you stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Yeah, this one time, we were out in L.A. <eos> Shuttin' down the Sunset Strip <eos> We were sippin' on bubbles <eos> Lookin' for some trouble <eos> When a supermodel strutted on in <eos> Yeah, Randy told me, "That girl is famous" <eos> She's way, way over your head <eos> I bet you five hundred <eos> You can't get her number <eos> So I just smiled and said: <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm a Prince Charmin', Casanova <eos> Don Juan, Romeo <eos> A smooth talkin' ladies' man <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Well, good friends and bad decisions <eos> Just go hand in hand <eos> And it's good to know you got somebody <eos> Who's got your back <eos> And got your can <eos> Here, hold this man, you know what I'm talkin' about <eos> Oh, man! <eos> Yeah, well hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> And let us show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> So don't be fakin' <eos> It's okay to be drinkin' <eos> And I'm gonna want it back again <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> No, no, man <eos> You stay here <eos> Yeah, and hold my beer <eos> I got you, little buddy <eos> Good luck with that <eos>

VERSE 1 <eos> You wouldn't read my letter if I wrote you <eos> You asked me not to call you on the phone <eos> But there's something I'm wanting to tell you <eos> So I wrote it in the words of this song <eos> CHORUS <eos> I didn't know God made honky tonk angels <eos> I might have known you'd never make a wife <eos> You gave up the only one that ever loved you <eos> And went back to the wild side of life <eos> VERSE 2 <eos> The glamor of the gay night life has lured you <eos> To the places where the wine and liquor flows <eos> Where you wait to be anybody's baby <eos> And forget the truest love you'll ever know <eos> CHORUS <eos> 
Dreams on your face, taking you away <eos> Silence on a silver plate <eos> Got no explanations beyond imagination <eos> How beautiful you are to me <eos> Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling <eos> I look at your face all night <eos> I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it <eos> And dream about me tonight <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I'd never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos> I can assure you, when it comes to this game <eos> That you'll never know how I play <eos> No intimidation, it's pure adoration <eos> I love you more than yesterday <eos> Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling <eos> I look at your face all night <eos> I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it <eos> And dream about me tonight <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I'd never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> Woo <eos> When you sleep <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> When you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> Woo <eos> When you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos> 
"So while you're fixing up your bed <eos> So while you’re organizing drawers <eos> Could you just listen to the problems had <eos> With problems of yours? <eos> And what’s that note you’re writing there? <eos> Why are you giving me this back? <eos> This was a gift from when we met <eos> Back when you weren’t so upset" <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable <eos> I couldn’t recognize your shell <eos> Your branching off had met an end <eos> From all the weight that made you bend <eos> And when you tried to shed your leaves <eos> You pined for warmth as they said <eos> “Your lack of love for your dear self <eos> Is sapping all of us here out! <eos> Trace your roots back to the ground <eos> Work out the knotholes for yourself” <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> The sight of your family made me feel responsible <eos> And I found the notes you left behind <eos> Little hints and helpless cries <eos> Desperate wishing to be over <eos> You said you’re trapped in your body <eos> And getting deeper every day <eos> They diagnosed you born that way <eos> They say it runs in your family <eos> A conscious erasure of working-class background <eos> Where despair trickles down <eos> Imbalanced chemical crutch <eos> Open up, swallow down <eos> You said “Remember me for me <eos> I need to set my spirit free” <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> (I called in sick, I called in sick) <eos> Tradition of closure nearly felt impossible <eos> (I called in sick, I called in sick) <eos> I should have never gave my word to you <eos> Not a cry, not a sound <eos> Might have learned how to swim <eos> But never taught how to drown <eos> You said “Remember me for me" <eos> I watched you set your spirit free <eos> 
I promise that one day I'll be around <eos> I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound <eos> Right now it's pretty crazy <eos> And I don't know how to stop or slow it down <eos> Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about <eos> And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now <eos> Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own <eos> So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone <eos> You'll never be alone <eos> When you miss me close your eyes <eos> I may be far, but never gone <eos> When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars <eos> And hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about <eos> And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now <eos> And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own <eos> So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone <eos> You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone <eos> You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone <eos> And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own <eos> So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you will never be alone <eos> 
Now when I think about it <eos> Never been in love before, no, no <eos> Whenever we talk about it <eos> I question if I'm sure <eos> And now when I think about us <eos> And everything that we are <eos> I'm closer now to acceptance <eos> And I won't cry no more, no, no <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Though we never really talked about it <eos> I never been in love before <eos> But this is something I know <eos> ‘Cause now I don't cry no more <eos> No more, no more, no more <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else, yeah <eos> Living without you <eos> Can we make it through? <eos> What else would I do? <eos> Alone without you <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos>

Fuiste tú <eos> Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera <eos> Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera <eos> Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía <eos> Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería <eos> Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas <eos> O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas <eos> Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje <eos> Las nubes grises también forman parte del paisaje <eos> Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada más que decir <eos> Solo queda insistir <eos> Dilo <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> La luz de neón del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada <eos> Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada <eos> Estoy en medio del que soy y del que tú quisieras <eos> Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera <eos> Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Asi se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada mas que decir <eos> Solo queda insistir <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendio la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada mas que decir <eos> Si quieres insistir <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> 
All my life has been a surprise <eos> Faces cast in gold on the fire <eos> Phantoms colloquial and new <eos> Feelings inside floating through you <eos> All my life leads me to die <eos> Now Sherlock and Watson decide <eos> On a true mystery of the mind <eos> One Arthur Doyle would cease to write <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this time has been wasted to find <eos> The darkness triumphed over light <eos> Is the creator on my side? <eos> Or has he left us all behind? <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this life has been a disguise <eos> Except for the hand in mine <eos> Belonging to my one true love <eos> In Santa Barbara on Hanukkah <eos> 
Turn all the lights down low <eos> I need to feel you close <eos> I need your denim eyes <eos> Pick me up and take me through the night <eos> Oh, I wanna touch you like he's never touched you <eos> And I wanna love you 'til the morning comes <eos> And I know you think you found somebody who knows you <eos> But he'll never love you like the way I do <eos> Oh, wild girl <eos> I don't want nobody but you <eos> You're my wild girl <eos> He'll never love you like the way I do <eos> You never hobble in pain <eos> I give you comfort and none of the shame <eos> Slow-dancing into his heart <eos> I pick you up and take you through the night <eos> Oh, I wanna touch you like he's never touched you <eos> And I wanna love you 'til the morning comes <eos> And I know you think you found somebody who knows you <eos> But he'll never love you like the way I do <eos> Oh, wild girl <eos> I don't want nobody but you <eos> You're my wild girl <eos> He'll never love you like the way I do <eos> When you love, when you love, when you love someone <eos> And it all goes to waste <eos> When you love, when you love, when you love someone <eos> You can't love him the same <eos> When you love, when you love, when you love someone <eos> And it all goes to waste <eos> When you love, when you love, when you love someone <eos> You can't love him the same <eos> Oh, I wanna touch you like he's never touched you <eos> And I wanna love you 'til the morning comes <eos> And I know you think you found somebody who knows you <eos> But he'll never love you like the way I do <eos>

On the way I was crowned a king <eos> Felt the wind underneath my wings <eos> I've been high and I've been low <eos> Played the fool and the star of the show <eos> Gone along for a wild ride <eos> And I can say lookin' in your eyes <eos> That it all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found cynicism, I found criticism <eos> I've been the zero, the hero <eos> And I have been the villain <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> On the way I was given the keys <eos> To the city they were mine to keep <eos> Over time every lock'll change <eos> But you love me all the same <eos> I found pessimism, I found skepticism <eos> I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would have been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos>

She calls me from the cold <eos> Just when I was low, feeling short of stable <eos> And all that she intends <eos> And all she keeps inside, isn't on the label <eos> She says she's ashamed <eos> Can she take me for a while? <eos> And can I be a friend? <eos> We'll forget the past <eos> Or maybe I'm not able <eos> And I break at the bend <eos> We're here and now <eos> Will we ever be again? <eos> 'Cause I have found <eos> All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade <eos> Away again <eos> She dreams a champagne dream <eos> Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper <eos> Lavender and cream <eos> Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her <eos> She says that love is for fools who fall behind <eos> And I'm somewhere between <eos> I never really know <eos> A killer from a savior <eos> 'Til I break at the bend <eos> We're here and now <eos> Will we ever be again? <eos> 'Cause I have found <eos> All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade <eos> Away again <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah oh <eos> Yeah, it's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah ah oh <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Ah ah oh <eos> It's too far away for me to hold <eos> It's too far away <eos> Guess I'll let it go <eos>

I swear I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And I barely still remember <eos> Who's in the pictures on my wall <eos> 'Cause, no, I can't <eos> Recall your scent <eos> Jasmine, tuberose, and lily <eos> Or your silly French accent <eos> All but forgotten <eos> About those eyes <eos> The shade of green that if he'd seen <eos> Would make F. Scott Fitzgerald cry <eos> But I won't <eos> Break down at 2 AM and call <eos> 'Cause I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And I'm sleepin' fine <eos> I don't mean to boast <eos> But I only dream about you <eos> Once or twice a night at most <eos> And it feels so good <eos> Eating alone <eos> I don't get distracted by your smile <eos> And miss the green lights drivin' home <eos> No sign of stoppin' <eos> The house isn't far <eos> But I think our song is comin' on <eos> And now I wanna crash the car <eos> But I won't <eos> Make that mistake again and fall <eos> So I say I don't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> And someday I won't <eos> Miss you at all <eos> 
Someday we'll be together <eos> Say, say, say it, say it again <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Oh, yeah, oh yeah <eos> You're far away <eos> From me my love <eos> And just as sure my, my baby <eos> As there are stars above <eos> I wanna say, I wanna say, I wanna say <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Yes we will, yes we will <eos> Say, someday (some sweet day) we'll be together <eos> I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> My love is yours, baby <eos> Oh, right from the start <eos> You, you, you posses my soul now honey <eos> And I know, I know you own my heart <eos> And I wanna say: <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Some sweet day we'll be together <eos> Yes we will, yes we will <eos> Someday (tell everybody now) we'll be together <eos> Yes we will, yes we will <eos> A long time ago, my my sweet thing <eos> I made a big mistake, honey <eos> I said, I said goodbye <eos> Oh, oh baby <eos> Ever (ever), ever (ever), ever since that day <eos> Now, now all I wanna do is cry, cry <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> I long for you every, every night <eos> Just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips baby <eos> Hold you ever, ever so tight <eos> And I wanna say <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Yes we will, yes we will <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Yes we will, yes we will <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> Someday we'll be together <eos> 
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky <eos> And I swear like the shadow that's by your side <eos> I see the questions in your eyes <eos> I know what's weighing on your mind <eos> You can be sure I know my part <eos> 'Cause I stand beside you through the years <eos> You'll only cry those happy tears <eos> And though I make mistakes, I'll never break your heart <eos> And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky <eos> I'll be there <eos> I swear like the shadow that's by your side <eos> I'll be there <eos> For better or worse, 'til death do us part <eos> I'll love you with every beat of my heart <eos> And I swear <eos> I'll give you everything I can <eos> I'll build your dreams with these two hands <eos> We'll hang some memories on the walls <eos> And when (and when) just the two of us are there <eos> You won't have to ask if I still care <eos> 'Cause as the time turns the page <eos> My love won't age at all <eos> And I swear (I swear) by the moon <eos> And the stars in the sky I'll be there (I'll be there) <eos> I swear (and I swear) like the shadow that's by your side <eos> I'll be there (I'll be there) <eos> For better or worse, 'til death do us part <eos> I'll love you with every beat of my heart <eos> And I swear <eos> I swear (I swear) by the moon and the stars in the sky <eos> I'll be there (I'll be there) <eos> I swear like the shadow that's by your side <eos> I'll be there (I'll be there) <eos> For better or worse (better or worse) <eos> Till death do us part (oh no) I'll love you <eos> With every single beat of my heart <eos> I swear <eos> I swear <eos> Oh, I swear <eos>

De madrugada desperte pesando en la noche de ayer <eos> Y recorri parte de mi vida <eos> Son muchos que perdi y algunos que siguen aqui <eos> Pero no hay nada que soñar me impida <eos> Cuantos amores me gane y cuantos fracase <eos> Pero sigo amando porque es mi vida <eos> Cuando amigos conoci y cuantos que perdi <eos> Pero sigo con los que mas queria <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, de noche puedo sentir tu piel <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, me agarras la mano antes de caer <eos> Otra vez <eos> Cuantas canciones que cante y cuantas que llore <eos> Pero sigo cantando porque es mi vida <eos> Cuantas noches te perdi pero hoy te tengo aqui <eos> No voy a dejarte nunca mas mi vida <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, de noche puedo sentir tu piel <eos> Otra vez, otra vez, me agarras la mano antes de caer <eos> 
Espérame <eos> Espérame cuando nadie me espera <eos> Regálame las flores que prefieras <eos> Que igual las voy aceptar <eos> No dudes que siento tu presencia <eos> Estando lejos <eos> Parece extraño pero <eos> Yo te tengo aquí muy adentro <eos> Y no importa cuando sale el sol <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> Reconocí cuando te vi <eos> Esa forma de dudar <eos> Sabiendo que no te gusta nadar <eos> Igual quiero saltar <eos> Un mar que se extiende <eos> Posibilidad <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> Un mar que se extiende <eos> Posibilidad <eos> Razones me sobran <eos> Si tu vas a estar <eos> Porque tú cambiaste mi universo <eos> Despiertas esa calma <eos> Que no sabía <eos> Que un día llegaría <eos> Es que tú transformas lo que veo <eos> Llegaste a mi vida <eos> ¿Por qué será? <eos> 
Brothers and sisters <eos> Lend me your ears <eos> Listen to my story, of love and death <eos> I fell deep in love, with Ama Fosua <eos> A girl of my dreams, you see what I mean <eos> On our wedding day <eos> With tears in her eyes <eos> She gave me a kiss <eos> It was the kiss of death <eos> Love and death, walk hand in hand <eos> The way to the brave, is just the same <eos> Love and death, walk hand in hand <eos> The way to the grave, is just the same <eos>
