The geese have flown <eos> Way up high <eos> Clean over hill and vale <eos> 
Hence my care for you <eos> Beautiful people <eos> You know you're that <eos> Hence my care for you <eos> I can't go back <eos> On all of that <eos> Hence my care for you <eos> That the love is ours <eos> That the love is ours <eos> A flap of the wings <eos> And the chaos that it brings <eos> Wake up my love <eos> Please don't be sad <eos> There is no time <eos> That the light goes on <eos> That the light goes off <eos> Flies out of the window <eos> While angel stroke your head <eos> To know you're that <eos> I can't go back <eos> (I’m running blind) <eos> (I’m running blind) <eos> (I’m running blind) <eos> Hence my care for you <eos> Beautiful people <eos> Taken from us (that our love is blind) <eos> If there is a God <eos> Hence my care for you <eos> You know you’re that <eos> And I am so afraid <eos> I’m running blind to the faces I have <eos> I can’t go back, to all of that <eos> To know you’re that <eos> I can’t go back <eos> I dial out the bad <eos> I dial out the bad <eos> Hence my care for you <eos> If there is a God <eos> If there is a God <eos> Cut me some slack <eos>

Vater der Träume <eos> Erwecke die Betörten <eos> Zu lange haben sie geträumt <eos> Öffne ihre Augen! <eos> Im Niemandsland gefangen <eos> Schwarz und weiß <eos> Gleichgeschaltete Kreaturen <eos> Ihr dreht euch bloß im Kreis <eos> Vater des Todes <eos> Erlöse uns von den Betörenden <eos> Zu lange haben sie getäuscht <eos> Entreiße ihren Geist! <eos> Seelenlose Hüllen <eos> Kaum des Lebens wert <eos> Kein Empfinden, kein Grund zu fühlen <eos> Von Habgier verzerrt <eos> Trümmerhaufen Menschlichkeit <eos> Woher nehmt ihr euch die Rechte? <eos> Leben, Zeit, Vergänglichkeit <eos> Stumpfsinn führt zu Einsamkeit! <eos> Vater der Träume <eos> Was ist der Sinn des Lebens <eos> Jene die dies vergessen <eos> Träumen bis zum Ende der Zeit <eos> Vater des Todes <eos> Erlöse uns vom Gift <eos> Paralysierend und tödlich zu gleich <eos> Tyrannische Pest Unmenschlichkeit <eos> Gelähmt durch Apathie <eos> Maskiert durch Euphorie <eos> Heuchlerisch ein Sinn gefunden <eos> Allein gelassen, im Leben versunken <eos> 
Sólo busco señales divinas <eos> Para amar sin temor a perderte <eos> Salir siempre ilesa <eos> De este laberinto <eos> Comprenderte <eos> Si pudiera leer tu mente <eos> Y sentirme autosuficiente <eos> Siempre huyes <eos> Después de tenerme <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Para querer sin lamentos <eos> No des más vueltas <eos> Ya no te mientas <eos> No finjas más sentimientos <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Abrir tu mar por el medio <eos> Saber qué piensas <eos> Correr el riesgo <eos> Quiero que me ames en serio <eos> Sólo busco engañar al destino <eos> No andar encadenada a tu sombra <eos> Sentir que merezco lealtad y respeto <eos> No tus sobras <eos> No pretendo vengarme ni usarle <eos> No comprendo a quién hizo esta historia <eos> Me hizo vivir a tus pies sin memoria <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Para querer sin lamentos <eos> No des más vueltas <eos> Ya no te mientas <eos> No finjas más sentimientos <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Abrir tu mar por el medio <eos> Saber qué piensas <eos> Correr el riesgo <eos> Quiero que me ames en serio <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Para querer sin lamentos <eos> No des más vueltas <eos> Ya no te mientas <eos> No finjas más sentimientos <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Abrir tu mar por el medio <eos> Saber qué piensas <eos> Correr el riesgo <eos> Quiero que me ames en serio <eos> Busco señales divinas <eos> Para querer sin lamentos <eos> No des más vueltas <eos> Ya no te mientas <eos> Quiero que me ames <eos> Me ames en serio <eos>

Who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> And who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> Who can say why your heart sighs <eos> As your love flies? Only time <eos> And who can say why your heart cries <eos> When your love lies? Only time <eos> Who can say when the roads meet? <eos> That love might be in your heart? <eos> And who can say when the day sleeps <eos> If the night keeps all your heart? <eos> Night keeps all your heart <eos> Who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> And who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> 
Welcome the spring, the summer rain <eos> Softly turned to sing again <eos> Welcome the bud, the summer blooming flower <eos> Welcome the child whose hand I hold <eos> Welcome to you both young and old <eos> We are ever new, we are ever new <eos>

Klasyk nie klasyczek <eos> Mam mine do przekminek <eos> Jak przekminie to wybije się <eos> To są style na ulicznym bagnie <eos> My krokodyle wpierdalamy <eos> Mięso żmijek z czym szczyle <eos> Ubliżacie mi ślepe cipy jak <eos> Daredevile zajebiste linie <eos> Wypuszczamy w płynie <eos> Jemy co to zmontujemy <eos> Kleimy to co mieli dźwięki <eos> Mówią że mieli mielić jak Tommy III <eos> Twoje gówno leży a nie siedzi <eos> Ja nie śledzę tego co od śledzi <eos> 4 2 no i 0 ja podjeżdżam panamerą <eos> Nie na ręcznym a na wstеcznym tak się właśnie robi przełom <eos> Wokół nas tu sypią znowu jakieś dziwnе proszki <eos> Powinienem się dziś uczyć bo mam w kurwe zaległości <eos> To jest historia ??? się już kończy 4 3 3 <eos> Już nie panamera tylko nowy klip klip <eos> Kapie na nas w kurwe sosu mamy tutaj drip drip <eos> Każdy z nas na gaciach nie banknotów tylko zioła plik plik <eos> Biorę bucha nie zamulam biegnę jak Usain <eos> Do palenia ja mam ducha, uśmiech od ucha do ucha <eos> Kładzie mi się pod nogami suka, robie jej na dupie dwutakt <eos> Rzucam trójkę ja nie jestem Kevin Durant <eos> Sprawa prosta <eos> Jest jak feniks słońca <eos> Ona czarna chodź to nie jest kawa Costa <eos> Kominiara chodź nie jestem z Komsta <eos> Brudne skoki tak chodzę po domach <eos> Dzwoni mi komura ujebałem czarny dres <eos> Wszystko co mnie rusza, to jebany stres <eos> Jebać cię, nie chce z tobą gadać psie <eos> Wysłałem sms, albo mms <eos> Zaraz wyślesz znaki SOS <eos> Wchodzę do koszar <eos> Tam jest bomba <eos> Eksplozja <eos> Brat mi kona <eos> Przyćpana morda <eos> Walną prozak <eos> Duża gruda <eos> Sztywno w uszach <eos> Ujebana stówa <eos> Taka to historia.. <eos> Historyjka w pamiętnikach <eos> Przepisana w lipnych liniach <eos> Jak jest lipa to zawijam <eos> Jak jest bit to się w niego kurwa wbijam <eos> Syta jest grupka ubita jak grudka <eos> Gotowa do wyjścia na podwórka <eos> Silna w porachunkach <eos> Kumasz dumy nie masz dumasz <eos> Chowasz to po ustach <eos> Nie wyplujesz nam do ucha <eos> Jesteś judasz <eos> Nie ma co cię słuchać <eos> Kręcisz się jak mucha <eos> Bredzisz jak dziunia <eos> W gifcie dla ciebie mamy chuja <eos> Wyjście dla ciebie to window <eos> Wypierdalaj szybko <eos> Nie schowasz się za policją <eos> Ty jebana dziwko <eos> Spraye nie tandente <eos> Jak polece to wyjebie capy <eos> Jak wychodze po kieszeniach mam psiakcze <eos> Psiki psiki clashe <eos> Pik pik robi karta <eos> Haha śmieje się szatan <eos> Bo to krwawa kurwa karta <eos> Jasna sprawa ja nie spadam <eos> Ja tu wpadam i się wbijam rytm <eos> Cel widzę w tym <eos> Człowieku wandalizm <eos> Nie wiesz co to styl <eos> Ja polecę z tym <eos> Ty co najwyżej możesz suck my dick <eos>

Over the moon, under the stars <eos> Feel them arresting me, unknowables <eos> Fading at dawn, troubles too <eos> Dimness sustains, oh, the regret <eos> I could be lost to you, lost in thought <eos> Sending a kiss back to the sky <eos> So has my world become run out of breath <eos> I'm not the only one to lose a friend <eos> Where do you go? You're going home <eos> What do I do with the void in your shape <eos> Leaving me frailty, a drop and I break <eos> What do I do with half of myself? <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I could be loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> You’re going home <eos> 
What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone now? <eos> Are you? <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> 
You could open with your failings <eos> Make them understand, show the love notes <eos> Make them picture with their eyes closed <eos> Make them wonder where the time goes <eos> Keep your distance south of river <eos> Draw a line, they are not together <eos> Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red <eos> Make me wonder where the time went <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> Be not a stranger land here <eos> I will leave this empty-handed <eos> Feeling selfish, common as shit <eos> Leave me question where your heart lends <eos> How you open-wounded withstand <eos> Lead me into some false pretence <eos> I will ruin you in a second <eos> Leave it up to interpretation <eos> Open-ended invitation <eos> And your wedding, I could crash it <eos> Whisper in your ear “God, I missed you <eos> It's been too much, I can’t stand it” <eos> Then I cried there in the staff room <eos> Selling my seats to your concert <eos> I won't stomach it if I see you <eos> Walking so tall, I can't reach you <eos> Happier, pretty picture <eos> With some new pretty little blue <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> 
I hope this woman that I’m callin’ <eos> Has got a bed that I can fall in <eos> Cause its gonna be a cold <eos> A cold and lonely night <eos> The one I had just up and left me <eos> So I gotta go and catch me <eos> I gotta find somebody to make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Make me, make me feel alright <eos> Girl I know I’m not the only <eos> The only one that’s feeling lonely <eos> So you take my hand <eos> And tell me I can hold you tight <eos> I’m not asking you to love me <eos> Sure don’t want you to judge me <eos> Don’t tell me your problems <eos> And I sure won’t tell you mine <eos> Just make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Just make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> You can make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> Make me feel alright <eos> You can make me feel alright <eos> Alright, feel alright <eos> You can make me feel alright <eos> Feel alright <eos> You can make me feel alright <eos> Feel alright <eos> Make me, make me feel alright <eos> Alright <eos> Alright <eos> Alright <eos> Alright <eos> 
Well, it looks to me like, the end is comin' <eos> My feet really hurt, and my nose is runnin' <eos> Friends and neighbors are dropping like flies <eos> You better cover your face, sanitize <eos> Everybody's doin' the best that they can <eos> We're all just waitin' on the Medicine Man <eos> The Medicine Man <eos> Well, you better lock your doors, turn on the news <eos> The whole damn world is singin' the blues <eos> The President lost, but he don't wanna go <eos> Mothеr Earth, she needs a little help you know <eos> Evеrybody's doin' the best that they can <eos> We’re all just waitin' on the Medicine Man <eos> The Medicine Man <eos> We gonna give everybody their little dose <eos> But we got to give it to the people who need it the most <eos> I can't tell you what the future holds <eos> It might turn to crap, it might turn to gold <eos> Maybe the bees might teach the pigs to fly <eos> But I'm just gonna love everybody 'til the day I die <eos> Everybody's doin' the best that they can <eos> We're all just waitin' on the Medicine Man <eos> We're all just waitin' on the Medicine Man <eos> 
Woke up this morning feeling bad <eos> Had the worst hangover that I ever had <eos> And I know that my baby had it going on, yeah <eos> And if I did it all over again, I’d do the same damn thing anyhow <eos> And if I did it all over again, I’d do the same damn thing anyhow, yeah <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> Eyes are like switchblades <eos> Breath of cigarettes <eos> Lord knows I’d like to look, but I was scared today <eos> And I know that my baby had it going on, yeah <eos> You had my hands and knees and loins shaking, and me end up speechless every time, yeah <eos> You had my hands and knees and loins shaking, and end up speechless every time, yeah <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm-mmm, mmm <eos> And I know that my baby had it going on <eos> And if I did it all over again, I’d do the same damn thing anyhow <eos> And if I did it all over again I’d do the same damn thing anyhow <eos> Same damn thing anyhow <eos> Same damn thing anyhow <eos> 
She's alright <eos> Blazin' through the night like a satellite <eos> She's alright <eos> Burnin' like a match, she's about to strike <eos> She's on fire, oh yeah <eos> She's on fire, hey, hey, hey, yeah <eos> She's so clear <eos> Shining like a diamond in the atmosphere <eos> She's right here <eos> Lighting my fuse, grinding my gears <eos> She's on fire, oh yeah <eos> She's on fire, hey, hey, hey, yeah <eos> She's on fire, oh, don't make me, baby, don't makе me, baby <eos> She's on fire <eos> Shе's all mine <eos> Like a smoke show workin' it overtime <eos> She's so fine <eos> What was I thinking she was ever mine? <eos> She's on fire, oh yeah, I say what it is I'm thinkin' <eos> She's on fire, that there girl done turned me on <eos> She's on fire, come on, come on, come on, come on, hey <eos> She's on fire, don't let that girl burn me out now, one more time <eos> 
Poor boy, I'm a long way from home <eos> Poor boy, I’m a long way from home <eos> Poor boy, I'm a long way from home <eos> World gonna do me no <eos> Babe, I can't stay here long <eos> No, no, no <eos> Poor boy, I’m a long way from home <eos> Where the world can't do me no <eos> Poor boy, I'm a long way from home <eos> Poor boy, I'm a long way from home <eos> Poor boy, I'm a long way from home <eos> Where the world can't do me no <eos> 
I feel like a bird with broken wings <eos> I can't fly back up in the trees <eos> Or like a addict fiendin' for crack <eos> Tryin' to break the habit, but it keep on comin' back <eos> Or like a child cryin' all night long <eos> Hungry for some food, but it's all gone <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> I feel like I'm lost and can't be found <eos> A boat with a hole that's slowly sinkin' down <eos> Or like a bully that put me to the test <eos> Got me paranoid and I can't get no rest <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> 
Ain't no time for education <eos> Too much corn in the field <eos> Ain't got time to go to school, y'all <eos> We got too much work around here <eos> Never had time for playin' <eos> Never had to have no fun <eos> Too much cotton needs haulin' <eos> And that's too much, probably be done <eos> It was hard, but it was fair <eos> We was always out there <eos> Out in the red hot sun <eos> 'Cause the work was never done <eos> For a sharecropper's son, yeah <eos> Workin' from kin to cane <eos> Out in the heat of the day <eos> Me and my brothers, we was prayin' for rain <eos> 'Cause we still gotta haul that hay <eos> It was hard, but it was fair <eos> We was always out there <eos> Out in the red hot sun <eos> For all the work was never done <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> It wasn't easy <eos> 'Cause the work was never done <eos> It wasn't easy <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> It ain't easy <eos> 'Cause the work ain't never done <eos> It ain't easy <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> For a sharecropper's son <eos> 
I'm going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Chilly wind don't blow <eos> I'm going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe <eos> Going with you, babe, I'm going with you, babe <eos> Don't care where you go <eos> Some other man, some other man <eos> Some other man, some other man <eos> He's always hanging around <eos> I'd rather be dead, rather be dead <eos> Rather be dead, I'd rather be dead <eos> Six feet in the ground <eos> I'm going down south, going down south <eos> Going down south, I'm going down south <eos> Chilly wind don't blow <eos> 
The desert dust it fills your eyes <eos> The rattlesnake shake takes you by surprise <eos> The coyotes sing in the calm of night <eos> The cactus water goes down like fire <eos> The City of Angels ain't too far from here <eos> And when I need some sin, it's always near <eos> The Caliente warms my bones <eos> And the Valley of Death is a skeleton's home <eos> The desert toad takes me for a ride <eos> The Lizard King's always by my side <eos> The hawk and eagle just want to fly <eos> But the horizon's hot and the air is dry <eos> The venom stings from the scorpion <eos> And the owl watches where I've been <eos> My lips are cracked from the howlin' wind <eos> I need to quench my thirst and heal my skin <eos> The mountains like painting <eos> The Joshua Tree <eos> Gram died in room eight and left it all to Keith <eos> Just a couple of miles from the Salton Sea <eos> But a little closer to heaven for someone like me, woo <eos> 
Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> I'm trying to make a brand new friend <eos> And everybody trying to fight <eos> It ain't easy, it ain't fair <eos> Is the world so messed up <eos> Am I the only one to care? <eos> So much love that I'm willing to share, alright, yeah <eos> I've got it right here <eos> So many things that I'm trying to do right <eos> Trying to make friends <eos> But everyone wanna fight <eos> Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> Working from early in the morning <eos> Up until the edge of night <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> I've been so many places <eos> City from town to town <eos> Looking for a real good woman <eos> They all seem to turn me down <eos> I'm looking for a Louisiana girl <eos> To put into my placе <eos> So when I wake up in the morning <eos> Thеre'd be a smile on her face <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Ooh, belong <eos> And I'll tell you one more thing <eos> I'm used to dealing with doubt <eos> Should I be in the big city? <eos> You know my money's running out <eos> Cost too much for a hamburger <eos> And they want too much for fries <eos> You better not talk to the big leg woman <eos> 'Cause they want too much for the thigh <eos> I guess I'll go back home, yeah, go back home <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Oh, going home, take it home now <eos>

Congratulations to all of the 90th Academy Award Nominees <eos> I love these movies <eos> But they never seem to choose the blockbusters, do they? <eos> They sure don't <eos> I guess they'll just have to settle for all that money, huh? <eos> Why not me? <eos> Do I not deserve a nomination? <eos> The reviews were raves to be sure <eos> "Fun for the whole family <eos> Look no farther than Thor" <eos> Why not me? <eos> I left my family to fight for what's right <eos> Saved the world from the devil below <eos> But I'm sure it was hard for <eos> Sir Daniel Day-Lewis to learn how to sew <eos> Why not me? <eos> I battled Cate Blanchett <eos> Why not me? <eos> I hid a sword in my dress <eos> We both faced death it's true <eos> But at least Lady Bird got into NYU... <eos> Why not me? <eos> In All The Money in the World <eos> They kidnapped one kid <eos> And they got a nomination <eos> I killed hundreds <eos> I guess that's what you get <eos> When you're not <eos> "Classically handsome" <eos> Oscars so white <eos> But I guess not for me <eos> I need to raise my quote <eos> So I can finally fix my teeth <eos> Horror movies always get the shaft <eos> Hey... let me do one! <eos> (sung) <eos> I peed while hanging from a zip-line <eos> Meryl Streep has never done that <eos> We'd like to petition for <eos> A new category: <eos> "Best Chris" <eos> Or you could just write "Chris" <eos> On an Oscar <eos> And we can share it <eos> Trade off on weekends <eos> Roll call! <eos> Hemsworth! <eos> Pratt! <eos> Evans! <eos> Pine! <eos> Rock! <eos> (sung) <eos> What? It's us! The Chrises! <eos> Go Chris! <eos> And why not The Snowman? <eos> It was a box office smash <eos> (spoken) <eos> What's that? It wasn't? <eos> (sung) <eos> Well Oscars doesn't care <eos> Since it was critically acclaimed <eos> (spoken) <eos> 7% positive? Are you serious? <eos> (sung) <eos> Well I thought it was a neat idea <eos> In The Shape of Water <eos> I heard that a lady boned a fish man <eos> But if you're gonna bone a fish man <eos> Why not bone a fish like this man? <eos> And what even is art? <eos> How do you define its importance? <eos> If popcorn movies are bad <eos> How come popcorn's so delicious? <eos> And when I blow up 6 cars <eos> How is that worse than Schindler's List is? <eos> Why not me? <eos> We saved the world <eos> Why not me? <eos> I am Toretto <eos> Why not me? <eos> I heard a lady boned a fish man <eos> Why not me? <eos> The Snowman was underrated! <eos> Why not me? <eos> We'd like to petition for <eos> A new category: <eos> "Best Chris" <eos> I have terrible teeth <eos> Why not me? <eos> I got a cool new haircut <eos> Why not me? <eos> I am Groot <eos> Why not us? <eos> 
Let me testify a little bit <eos> Yes, yes <eos> What is the meaning of life? <eos> Well, I can't talk philosophy <eos> I know that every new sunrise <eos> The more it dawns on me <eos> I may be getting old <eos> But I sure ain't done yet <eos> 'Cause the longer that I live <eos> The older I want to get <eos> My body's just flesh and bone <eos> Wrapped around a soul <eos> When it's time to leave this earth <eos> I hope I'm the last to know <eos> When I go I'll be screaming <eos> "I ain't finishеd yet" <eos> 'Cause the longеr that I live <eos> The older I want to get <eos> Some folks just lay down and quit <eos> At the end of life's race <eos> But I'm gonna keep on keepin' on <eos> With one foot in the grave <eos> You see, I've climbed the mountains high <eos> And I've played the valley low <eos> And for all the gigs I've done <eos> I ain't got much to show <eos> Though I'm never slowin' down <eos> Until I play my final set <eos> 'Cause the longer that I live <eos> The older I want to get <eos> You better believe it <eos> I want to keep on keepin' on <eos> With every new sunrise <eos> The older I want to get <eos> I want to push to keep on keepin' on <eos> Heading down life's long road <eos> I'm gonna have to be dragged <eos> Just kickin', screamin' <eos> I want to live a long life <eos> 'Til I get my final curtain call <eos>

I'm leaving this town tomorrow <eos> I got many places to see <eos> And many places to go <eos> I'm so tired of doing the same old thing <eos> Shooting for the highest star <eos> Want people to remember my name <eos> If you don't understand <eos> Let me break it down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> I have friends and family that I see everyday <eos> Don't plan on moving forward <eos> Stuck in the same old place <eos> But that's not the road that I wanna go down <eos> I gotta do what's best for me <eos> Ain't no hanging around <eos> I could stay here forever <eos> But I just can't stick around <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> When the rooster crows I'm leaving <eos> And I ain't looking back <eos> All you gonna see is taillights <eos> Crossing those railroad tracks <eos> If I don't leave I'll die here <eos> And end up six feet down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> 
Well I know you don't love me <eos> Hey I know the reason why <eos> Well I know you don't love me <eos> Baby I know the reason why <eos> Well you take all of my money <eos> And you treat me like a child <eos> Like a little child <eos> Well now the woman I love <eos> Baby done been here and gone <eos> Well now the woman I love <eos> Well done been here and gone <eos> Well now if things don't change <eos> You know I ain't gonna be here long <eos> Be here long <eos> I ain't gonna be here long, ain't gonna be here long (repeat 5 times) <eos> She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, she's gone boy, she's gone, she's gone <eos> For long, how I miss ya baby, she's gone <eos> Oh, my baby's gone, she's gone <eos> I'm ain't gonna be here long <eos> Well I'm leaving my baby <eos> And I really don't want to go <eos> Well I'm leaving my baby <eos> And I really don't want to go <eos> Well she got her another man <eos> And she don't want me no more <eos> She don't want me no more (repeat) <eos> It's alright, it's alright boy <eos> It's alright, it's alright, alright, alright, it's alright babe! <eos> Yeah hey!

As long as time keeps ticking, long as people have to cry <eos> When I see loved ones leaving, saying last goodbyes <eos> I believe these blues are never gonna die <eos> When I see bad things happen to good folks everyday <eos> Children going hungry with nothin’ on their plates <eos> I believe these blues won’t ever go away <eos> People try to end their troubles by drinking whiskey down <eos> But I believe these blues will always be around <eos> I can’t tell the future but I can play my song <eos> I can’t tell the future but I sho' 'nuf can play my song <eos> And I believe these blues will go on and on and on <eos> 
You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> From my head down to my shoes <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> From my head down to my shoes <eos> I can't win, cause I don't have a thing to lose <eos> I stopped by my daughters house <eos> You know I just want to use the phone <eos> I stopped by my daughters house <eos> You know I just want to use the phone <eos> You know my new grand baby came to the door <eos> And said, granddaddy you know ain't no one at home <eos> I said now look out <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> From my head down to my shoes <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> From my head down to my shoes <eos> You know I can't win, now people <eos> Cause I don't have a thing to lose <eos> Alright <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> You damn right, I've got the blues <eos> Yeah <eos> 
Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby left this town <eos> Sunshining all day long <eos> But the rain keep coming down <eos> She's my life I need her so <eos> Why she left I just don't know <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since I set right down and cried <eos> Keep raining all the time <eos> But the river is running dry <eos> Lord help me it just isn't right <eos> I love that girl with all-a my might <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby broke my heart <eos> Searching for her in a while <eos> Like a blind man in the dark <eos> Love can make a poor man rich <eos> Or break his heart I don't know which <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Like a ship out on the sea <eos> Praying for her each night <eos> That she would come back-a home to me <eos> Life is love and love is right <eos> I hope she come back home tonight <eos>

I was born at the turn of the century <eos> Lucky to be born at all <eos> Grew up way down in Mississippi <eos> When I heard Robert Johnson call <eos> I’ve seen a lot and I've done a lot <eos> Too young to lay down in that hole <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos> Breaking rocks on a chain gang <eos> Up until the sun went down <eos> Too many souls are buried <eos> In the dirt poor delta ground <eos> I’ve seen a lot and I've done a lot <eos> Just too young to lay down in that hole <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos> I put lightning back in bottles <eos> Poke rattlesnakes just for fun <eos> People say I got an old soul <eos> And I ain’t even twenty-one <eos> But I’ve seen a lot and I done a lot <eos> Just ain’t ready for the hole, no I ain't <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos> 
A princess cooking in the kitchen, playing solitaire <eos> She been burning them stacks with a monkey on her back says daddy ain't there <eos> She been swinging bags and picking up the slack and it ain't fair <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> She made a deal with the angels and then never let go <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> When I'm driving down the highway, when I want to let up <eos> There's an angel on my shoulder with sweet tea driving in her old gray one <eos> Saying play this song, but the heart is a road that don't give up <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> She made a deal with the angels and then never let go <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> For just a minute and a moment, before all the roar <eos> Pride beside me here to ignite me when I'm finding that I'm all alone <eos> With prayer crossed paths, {?] but yeah you've been here before <eos> Go baby, sell your soul to rock and roll <eos> Yeah baby, sell your soul to rock and roll <eos> She made a deal with the angels and then never let go <eos> So I could sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> In the name of grandma, and granddad's ghost <eos> And the poster of a woman, mama, when she kissed me and let me go <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> She made a deal with the angels so I never let go <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> We made a deal with the angels so I never let go <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock and roll <eos> I'm gonna sell my soul to rock & roll <eos>

She's comin for you <eos> Hear the chains rattle <eos> Turn you into a slave <eos> Another piece of chattel <eos> Across the seas <eos> Stormy waters <eos> Showed no mercy <eos> She was satan’s daughter <eos> Born to steal <eos> With bodies to sell <eos> She had her own special <eos> Place in hell <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> She took souls <eos> On a horrible trip <eos> Her morning song <eos> Was the crack of a whip <eos> Ones who survived <eos> Died a long time ago <eos> Most of them buried <eos> Out at old plateau <eos> But the pain and the memory <eos> Will never go away <eos> Her spirits still lives <eos> By the shores of the bay <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' with her ghost <eos> She was a dirty secret <eos> Forgot but not forgiven <eos> But the shame was so great <eos> She could not stay hidden <eos> She's on fire.... <eos> Her flame no longer lights up atnight <eos> Now dreams survive and hope burns bright <eos> People still come from miles around <eos> To praise the folks of africatown <eos> Who rose from the ashes of sad history <eos> To stand unchained proud and free <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' <eos> We’re still livin' <eos> With her ghost <eos>

Roll up my friends and gather round <eos> The Medicine Man is back in town <eos> Mirrors and smoke and trickery <eos> Your very own real life make believe <eos> Bring your money and get in line <eos> Two for a nickel, three for a dime <eos> Miracle cures for aching bones <eos> But he takes your gold, sells you stone <eos> The devil rides in a horse and cart <eos> The purveyor of the darkest art <eos> I was bit by a snake, burnt by the fire <eos> Took the bait, shame on me <eos> I was taken for a ride by a barefaced liar <eos> Admission is free but he robs you blind <eos> A little taste to ease a troubled mind <eos> A glimpse of truth beyond the veil <eos> Oh a fallen angel’s holy grail <eos> He disappeared before sunrise <eos> Before I saw through his disguise <eos> Stole my soul, off he ran <eos> I was played for a fool by a Medicine Man <eos> The devil rides in a horse and cart <eos> The purveyor of the darkest art <eos> I was bit by a snake, burnt by the fire <eos> Took the bait, shame on me <eos> I was taken for a ride <eos> Taken for a ride <eos> He disappeared before sunrise <eos> Before I saw through his disguise <eos> Stole my soul, off he ran <eos> I was played for a fool by a Medicine Man <eos> The devil rides in a horse and cart <eos> The purveyor of the darkest art <eos> I was bit by a snake, burnt by the fire <eos> Took the bait, shame on me <eos> I was taken for a ride <eos> Taken for a ride <eos> By a barefaced liar <eos> Oh taken yeah <eos> Oh I was taken for a ride <eos>

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> 
I found a love for me <eos> Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <eos> Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <eos> Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me <eos> 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <eos> Not knowing what it was <eos> I will not give you up this time <eos> But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own <eos> And in your eyes, you're holding mine <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song <eos> When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath <eos> But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight <eos> Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know <eos> She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home <eos> I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets <eos> To carry love, to carry children of our own <eos> We are still kids, but we're so in love <eos> Fighting against all odds <eos> I know we'll be alright this time <eos> Darling, just hold my hand <eos> Be my girl, I'll be your man <eos> I see my future in your eyes <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song <eos> When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful <eos> I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song <eos> I have faith in what I see <eos> Now I know I have met an angel in person <eos> And she looks perfect <eos> I don't deserve this <eos> You look perfect tonight <eos> 
Tell me somethin', girl <eos> Are you happy in this modern world? <eos> Or do you need more? <eos> Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for? <eos> I'm falling <eos> In all the good times I find myself <eos> Longin' for change <eos> And in the bad times I fear myself <eos> Tell me something, boy <eos> Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void? <eos> Or do you need more? <eos> Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore? <eos> I'm falling <eos> In all the good times I find myself <eos> Longing for change <eos> And in the bad times I fear myself <eos> I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <eos> I'll never meet the ground <eos> Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Whoah! <eos> I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in <eos> I'll never meet the ground <eos> Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> In the shallow, shallow <eos> We're far from the shallow now <eos> 
I heard that you're settled down <eos> That you found a girl and you're married now <eos> I heard that your dreams came true <eos> Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you <eos> Old friend, why are you so shy? <eos> Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light <eos> I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited <eos> But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it <eos> I had hoped you'd see my face <eos> And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> You know how the time flies <eos> Only yesterday was the time of our lives <eos> We were born and raised in a summer haze <eos> Bound by the surprise of our glory days <eos> I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited <eos> But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it <eos> I had hoped you'd see my face <eos> And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Nothing compares, no worries or cares <eos> Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made <eos> Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Never mind, I'll find someone like you <eos> I wish nothing but the best for you, too <eos> Don't forget me, I beg <eos> I remember you said <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead <eos> 
Well you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> Staring at the bottom of your glass <eos> Hoping one day you'll make a dream last <eos> But dreams come slow and they go so fast <eos> You see her when you close your eyes <eos> Maybe one day you'll understand why <eos> Everything you touch surely dies <eos> But you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Staring at the ceiling in the dark <eos> Same old empty feeling in your heart <eos> 'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast <eos> Well you see her when you fall asleep <eos> But never to touch and never to keep <eos> 'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep <eos> Well you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh <eos> And you let her go <eos> Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh <eos> When you let her go <eos> Whoa <eos> 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> 
You and me, we made a vow <eos> For better or for worse <eos> I can't believe you let me down <eos> But the proof's in the way it hurts <eos> For months on end I've had my doubts <eos> Denying every tear <eos> I wish this would be over now <eos> But I know that I still need you here <eos> You say I'm crazy <eos> 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done <eos> But when you call me baby <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> You've been so unavailable <eos> Now, sadly, I know why <eos> Your heart is unobtainable <eos> Even though Lord knows you kept mine <eos> You say I'm crazy <eos> 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done <eos> But when you call me baby <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> I have loved you for many years <eos> Maybe I am just not enough <eos> You've made me realise my deepest fear <eos> By lying and tearing us up <eos> You say I'm crazy <eos> 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done <eos> But when you call me baby <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> You say I'm crazy <eos> 'Cause you don't think I know what you've done <eos> But when you call me baby <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, and I know, know <eos> I know I'm not the only one <eos> 
We're in the homestretch of the hard times <eos> We took a hard left, but we're alright <eos> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but <eos> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I <eos> Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried <eos> No, it don't always go the way we planned it <eos> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> When the bones are good <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter) <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah) <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain) <eos> 'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo) <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo) <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Yeah, ooh <eos>

My lover's got humor <eos> She's the giggle at a funeral <eos> Knows everybody's disapproval <eos> I should've worshipped her sooner <eos> If the heavens ever did speak <eos> She's the last true mouthpiece <eos> Every Sunday's getting more bleak <eos> A fresh poison each week <eos> "We were born sick" <eos> You heard them say it <eos> My church offers no absolutes <eos> She tells me "Worship in the bedroom" <eos> The only Heaven I'll be sent to <eos> Is when I'm alone with you <eos> I was born sick, but I love it <eos> Command me to be well <eos> Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me that deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me that deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> If I'm a pagan of the good times <eos> My lover's the sunlight <eos> To keep the goddess on my side <eos> She demands a sacrifice <eos> Drain the whole sea <eos> Get something shiny <eos> Something meaty for the main course <eos> That's a fine looking high horse <eos> What you got in the stable? <eos> We've a lot of starving faithful <eos> That looks tasty <eos> That looks plenty <eos> This is hungry work <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me my deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me my deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> No masters or kings when the ritual begins <eos> There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin <eos> In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene <eos> Only then I am human <eos> Only then I am clean <eos> Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me that deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> Take me to church <eos> I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies <eos> I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife <eos> Offer me that deathless death <eos> Good God, let me give you my life <eos> 
Right from the start <eos> You were a thief, you stole my heart <eos> And I, your willing victim <eos> I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty <eos> And with every touch, you fixed them <eos> Now you've been talking in your sleep <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Things you never say to me <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Tell me that you've had enough <eos> Of our love, our love <eos> Just give me a reason <eos> Just a little bit's enough <eos> Just a second - we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> It's in the stars <eos> It's been written in the scars on our hearts <eos> We're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> I'm sorry I don't understand <eos> Where all of this is coming from <eos> I thought that we were fine <eos> (Oh, we had everything) <eos> Your head is running wild again <eos> My dear, we still have everything <eos> And it's all in your mind <eos> (Yeah, but this is happening) <eos> You've been having real bad dreams <eos> Oh, oh <eos> You used to lie so close to me <eos> Oh, oh <eos> There's nothing more than empty sheets <eos> Between our love, our love <eos> Oh, our love, our love, love <eos> Just give me a reason <eos> Just a little bit’s enough <eos> Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> I’ve never stopped <eos> You’re still written in the scars on my heart <eos> You’re not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> Oh, tears ducts and rust <eos> I'll fix it for us <eos> We're collecting dust, but our love's enough <eos> You're holding it in <eos> You're pouring a drink <eos> No, nothing is as bad as it seems <eos> We'll come clean <eos> Just give me a reason <eos> Just a little bit's enough <eos> Just a second - we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> It's in the stars <eos> It's been written in the scars on our hearts <eos> That we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> Just give me a reason <eos> Just a little bit's enough <eos> Just a second we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> It's in the stars <eos> It's still written in the scars on our hearts <eos> That we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> Oh-oh, we can learn to love again <eos> Oh-oh, can learn to love again <eos> Oh-oh <eos> That we're not broken, just bent <eos> And we can learn to love again <eos> 
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground <eos> And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound <eos> You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down <eos> But wait <eos> You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around <eos> And say (That) <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> Too late, oh, oh <eos> I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh <eos> I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue <eos> And you say <eos> Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you <eos> But I'm afraid <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize <eos> It's too late, oh, oh <eos> It's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, yeah <eos> I said it's too late to apologize, yeah <eos> I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground <eos> 
What would I do without your smart mouth? <eos> Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out <eos> You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin' <eos> I can't pin you down <eos> What's goin' on in that beautiful mind? <eos> I'm on your magical mystery ride <eos> And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me <eos> But I'll be alright <eos> My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine <eos> You're crazy and I'm out of my mind <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> How many times do I have to tell you? <eos> Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too <eos> The world is beating you down, I'm around <eos> Through every mood <eos> You're my downfall, you're my muse <eos> My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues <eos> I can't stop singing, it's ringing <eos> In my head for you <eos> My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine <eos> You're crazy and I'm out of my mind <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> Give me all of you, oh <eos> Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts <eos> Risking it all, though it's hard <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you <eos> I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> 
I swear to God, when I come home <eos> I'm gonna hold you so close <eos> I swear to God, when I come home, I'll never let go <eos> Like a river, I flow to the ocean I know <eos> You pull me close, guiding me home <eos> And I need you to know that we're <eos> Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love <eos> And I'm not scared to say those words <eos> With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love <eos> I swear to God, I can see <eos> Four kids and no sleep <eos> We'll have one on each knee, you and me, hmm <eos> And when they've grown up <eos> You're still the girl in the club <eos> When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much <eos> And I need you to know that we're <eos> Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love <eos> And I'm not scared to say those words <eos> With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love <eos> I swear to God, every day <eos> He won't take you away <eos> 'Cause without you, babe, I lose my way <eos> Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love) <eos> Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love) <eos> Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love) <eos> Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love) <eos> Oh, I'm in love (I'm in love) <eos> Oh, I'm in love (Fallin' like the stars) <eos> And I need you to know that we're <eos> Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love <eos> And I'm not scared to say those words <eos> With you I'm safe, we're fallin' like the stars, we're fallin' in love <eos> 
I just want you close <eos> Where you can stay forever <eos> You can be sure <eos> That it will only get better <eos> You and me together <eos> Through the days and nights <eos> I don't worry 'cause <eos> Everything's going to be alright <eos> People keep talking, they can say what they like <eos> But all I know is everything's gonna be alright <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you <eos> When the rain is pouring down <eos> And my heart is hurting <eos> You will always be around <eos> This I know for certain <eos> You and me together <eos> Through the days and nights <eos> I don't worry 'cause <eos> Everything's going to be alright <eos> People keep talking, they can say what they like <eos> But all I know is everything's gonna be alright <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel <eos> I know some people search the world <eos> To find something like what we have <eos> I know people will try, try to divide, something so real <eos> So till the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one <eos> No one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I'm feelin' <eos> No one, no one, no one <eos> Can get in the way of what I feel for you <eos> Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <eos> Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh <eos> 
That Arizona sky <eos> Burnin' in your eyes <eos> You look at me and babe, I wanna catch on fire <eos> It’s buried in my soul <eos> Like California gold <eos> You found the light in me that I couldn’t find <eos> So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words <eos> Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts <eos> When the sun goes down <eos> And the band won't play <eos> I'll always remember us this way <eos> Lovers in the night <eos> Poets tryna write <eos> We don't know how to rhyme, but damn, we try <eos> But all I really know <eos> You're where I wanna go <eos> The part of me that's you will never die <eos> So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words <eos> Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts <eos> When the sun goes down <eos> And the band won't play <eos> I'll always remember us this way <eos> Oh yeah <eos> I don't wanna be just a memory, baby, yeah <eos> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo <eos> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo <eos> Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo hoo hooooooooo <eos> So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words <eos> Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts <eos> When the sun goes down and the band won't play <eos> I'll always remember us this way <eos> Way yeah <eos> When you look at me and the whole world fades <eos> I'll always remember us this way <eos> Oooh, oooh, hmmmm <eos> Oooh, oooh, hmmmm <eos> 
There are days <eos> I wake up and I pinch myself <eos> You're with me, not someone else <eos> And I'm scared, yeah, I'm still scared <eos> That it's all a dream <eos> 'Cause you still look perfect as days go by <eos> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <eos> I'd stop the world if it gave us time <eos> 'Cause when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> When you say <eos> You love the way I make you feel <eos> Everything becomes so real <eos> Don't be scared, no, don't be scared <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> And you still look perfect as days go by <eos> Even the worst ones, you make me smile <eos> I'd stop the world if it gave us time <eos> 'Cause when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> All my life <eos> I thought it'd be hard to find <eos> The one, 'til I found you <eos> And I find it bittersweet <eos> 'Cause you gave me something to lose <eos> But when you love someone <eos> You open up your heart <eos> When you love someone <eos> You make room <eos> If you love someone <eos> And you're not afraid to lose 'em <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> You probably never loved someone like I do <eos> 
I remember when <eos> I remember, I remember when I lost my mind <eos> There was something so pleasant about that place <eos> Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space <eos> And when you're out there without care <eos> Yeah, I was out of touch <eos> But it wasn't because I didn't know enough <eos> I just knew too much <eos> Does that make me crazy? <eos> Does that make me crazy? <eos> Does that make me crazy? <eos> Possibly <eos> And I hope that you are having the time of your life <eos> But think twice, that's my only advice <eos> Come on now, who do you <eos> Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are? <eos> Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul <eos> You really think you're in control? <eos> Well, I think you're crazy <eos> I think you're crazy <eos> I think you're crazy <eos> Just like me <eos> My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb <eos> And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them <eos> Ever since I was little <eos> Ever since I was little, it looked like fun <eos> And it's no coincidence I've come <eos> And I can die when I'm done <eos> But maybe I'm crazy <eos> Maybe you're crazy <eos> Maybe we're crazy <eos> Probably <eos> 
I think I've had enough <eos> I might get a little drunk <eos> I say what's on my mind <eos> I might do a little time <eos> 'Cause all of my kindness <eos> Is taken for weakness <eos> Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin' <eos> And we got three more days 'til Friday <eos> I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin' <eos> I swear I wish somebody would tell me <eos> Ooh, that's all I want <eos> Woke up an optimist <eos> Sun was shinin', I'm positive <eos> We can run <eos> Then I heard you was talkin' trash <eos> I'm on a mystery <eos> Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz <eos> Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin' <eos> And we got three more days ‘til Friday <eos> I’m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin' <eos> I swear I wish somebody would try me <eos> Ooh, that’s all I want <eos> And I know that you're up tonight <eos> Thinkin', "How could I be so selfish?" <eos> But you called 'bout a thousand times <eos> Wondering where I've been <eos> Now I know that you're up tonight <eos> Thinkin', "How could I be so reckless?" <eos> But I just can't apologize <eos> I hope you can understand, yeah <eos> If I go to jail tonight <eos> Promise you'll pay my bail <eos> See they want to buy my pride <eos> But that just ain't up for sale <eos> See all of my kindness (mhm) <eos> Is taken for weakness <eos> Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin' <eos> And we got three more days 'til Friday <eos> I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin' <eos> I swear I wish somebody would tell me <eos> Ooh, that's all I want <eos> Four, five seconds from wildin' <eos> And we got three more days 'til Friday <eos> Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin' <eos> I swear I wish somebody would tell me <eos> 'Cause that's all I want <eos> 
One, two, three, four <eos> Never sleep 'cause we night-owls <eos> Roam the streets when the lights out <eos> Give you the world that you deserve <eos> Sometimes I wish we could reverse <eos> VVS and your Prada <eos> Spend it 'til I'm down to nada <eos> Red on your new bottoms <eos> I can't seem to get you out 'em <eos> Do what I'm liking <eos> This feeling so righteous <eos> How did you know I wouldn't fight this <eos> Baby go spend it all <eos> Let's catch a flight then <eos> Eat, get the itis <eos> Hoping some day I don't wake up <eos> I'll pay up <eos> Feels like I'm buying more time <eos> So keep grooving <eos> And don't stop <eos> What you're doing <eos> I'm buying more time <eos> 'Cause I need an overdose of that <eos> And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> Mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine <eos> And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> Mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine <eos> I can't get off her love <eos> I can't get off her drug <eos> I get to panicking <eos> When she go vanishing <eos> Ain't no sun in the shade room <eos> She say, "Broke bitches they be late soon" <eos> Know I like it when you make rules <eos> Tell me more I can pay you <eos> Do what I'm liking <eos> This feeling so righteous <eos> How did you know I wouldn't fight this <eos> Baby go spend it all <eos> Let's catch a flight then <eos> Eat, get the itis <eos> Hoping some day I don't wake up <eos> I'll pay up <eos> Feels like I'm buying more time <eos> So keep grooving <eos> And don't stop <eos> What you're doing <eos> I'm buying more time <eos> 'Cause I need an overdose of that <eos> And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> Mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine <eos> And tell me you're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> Mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine (ooh ooh) <eos> You're mine <eos> Tell me you're mine <eos> Fast cars, ride on my heart <eos> Max card, shop you ain't shy, no <eos> Heart, all that we'll know <eos> I, diamond and gold <eos> The lights, all that we'll know <eos> The lights, diamond and gold <eos> The vice, all that she knows <eos> The ice, diamond and gold <eos> The vice, all that she knows <eos> The lights, all that we'll know <eos>

Wouldn't you know <eos> Those brown eyes <eos> See a side of me <eos> Nobody knows <eos> Nobody knows but you <eos> I wanna go <eos> Go wherever your thoughts lead <eos> Your treasures you hold <eos> Why don't you show the truth <eos> 'Cause what I've seen so far is heaven sent <eos> Eloquent and decadent <eos> Every drop you send my way I hold on, babe <eos> I'd live this whole damn life all over again <eos> Just to meet you once again <eos> Every second, minute, hour still in place <eos> 'Cause you've always been mine <eos> You've always been mine <eos> You've always been <eos> Would you believe <eos> Looked all ovеr creation <eos> When you had the kеys <eos> Standing in front of me <eos> How could it be <eos> Almost gave up completely <eos> But love wouldn't leave <eos> Love wanted me to see <eos> 'Cause what I've seen so far is heaven sent <eos> Eloquent and decadent <eos> Every drop you send my way I hold on, babe <eos> I'd live this whole damn life all over again <eos> Just to meet you once again <eos> Every second, minute, hour still in place <eos> 'Cause you've always been mine <eos> You've always been mine <eos> You've always been <eos> 
I can see your breath in the window <eos> Written I'm sorry <eos> You're fogging up friendship <eos> I don't want to say it back <eos> Do I need this stress or a symbol? <eos> I don't know probably <eos> The fate of my conscience <eos> Never thought much of that <eos> Could be easier to drive you mad <eos> Like I'm Jason Statham <eos> Do I know how to keep it all intact? <eos> No <eos> I think I'm dying in the subtlety <eos> Lying 'bout the worst of me <eos> I just wanna stay on track <eos> Crying like it hurts to be <eos> What we wanted initially <eos> Why don't you just cut some slack? <eos> Like peaches, apple pie, or strawberry cream <eos> It's like you haven't tasted pain and suffering <eos> To drive it home in words easily explained <eos> Love is just a passion with a four-letter name <eos> It could be easier to make you mad <eos> Just need a little more pressure <eos> The indecision couldn't make you crack <eos> Like it was now or never <eos> Would you pretend to see the pain I lack? <eos> Just for the simple pleasure <eos> Could make a movie out of the laughs we had <eos> I think I'm dying in the subtlety <eos> Lying 'bout the worst of me <eos> I just wanna stay on track (I just wanna stay on track) <eos> Crying like it hurts to be what we wanted initially <eos> Why don't you just cut some slack? <eos>

Knew by the first touch <eos> The first glance <eos> My first blush <eos> That I was something special <eos> I was someone you couldn’t touch <eos> Unless you worked and made it happen <eos> Then the whole thing became different <eos> It's my life I wanna live it <eos> If it's yours then it's your business <eos> Blurry eyes and a Discman that still works <eos> Yeah it hurts <eos> When it shatters in a million pieces first <eos> I can tell the way that I knew I was different <eos> Trying to mingle but when I talk no one listens <eos> But my eyes can glisten <eos> They can cry all they want and I can hide all day long <eos> How is it that a child can feel like he don't belong <eos> I kept my chin up and I did a bunch of drugs <eos> I don't regret it now but I know I had enough <eos> It's all these years where we just tried to fill a void <eos> At least we weren’t alone smoking weed <eos> Paranoid <eos> Unknown pills from parents' bathrooms our noses like vacuums <eos> Up all night on the chat rooms chatting away with Matthew <eos> And all these years where we just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> Countless nights star gazing <eos> Holy dope that we are blazing <eos> New feelings it's amazing <eos> Kisses by the water <eos> I'm an unruly daughter <eos> Yeah I make her wanna slap her <eos> But she knows that I love her <eos> I feel a lot and sometimes it just gets too much <eos> My breathing changes and my neck it tingles <eos> I get a rush <eos> It's adrenaline <eos> I'm in survival mode <eos> I fucking hate it <eos> But it's my normal mode <eos> Gotta learn gotta live <eos> Another day <eos> Are you feeling fine <eos> Yeah I'm okay <eos> I got 5 on it though <eos> Were 4 on a blunt <eos> I know you think it's too much <eos> But we broke, we wanna smoke <eos> And we just tried to fill a avoid <eos> So many things we want to avoid <eos> And we just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos> We just tried to fill a void <eos> Just tried to fill a void <eos>

You belong among the wildflowers <eos> You belong in a boat out at sea <eos> Sail away, kill off the hours <eos> You belong somewhere you feel free <eos> Run away, find you a lover <eos> Go away somewhere all bright and new <eos> I have seen no other <eos> Who compares with you <eos> You belong among the wildflowers <eos> You belong in a boat out at sea <eos> You belong with your love on your arm <eos> You belong somewhere you feel free <eos> Run away, go find a lover <eos> Run away, let your heart be your guide <eos> You deserve the deepest of cover <eos> You belong in that home by and by <eos> You belong among the wildflowers <eos> You belong somewhere close to me <eos> Far away from your trouble and worry <eos> You belong somewhere you feel free <eos> You belong somewhere you feel free <eos> 
Just before our love got lost you said <eos> "I am as constant as a northern star" <eos> And I said, "Constantly in the darkness <eos> Where's that at? <eos> If you want me I'll be in the bar" <eos> On the back of a cartoon coaster <eos> In the blue TV screen light <eos> I drew a map of Canada <eos> Oh, Canada <eos> With your face sketched on it twice <eos> Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine <eos> You taste so bitter and so sweet <eos> Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling <eos> And I would still be on my feet <eos> Oh, I would still be on my feet <eos> Oh, I am a lonely painter <eos> I live in a box of paints <eos> I'm frightened by the devil <eos> And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid <eos> I remember that time you told me, you said <eos> "Love is touching souls" <eos> Surely you touched mine <eos> 'Cause part of you pours out of me <eos> In these lines from time to time <eos> Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine <eos> You taste so bitter and so sweet <eos> Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling <eos> Still I'd be on my feet <eos> I would still be on my feet <eos> I met a woman <eos> She had a mouth like yours <eos> She knew your life <eos> She knew your devils and your deeds <eos> And she said <eos> "Go to him, stay with him if you can <eos> But be prepared to bleed" <eos> Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine <eos> You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet <eos> Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling <eos> Still I'd be on my feet <eos> I would still be on my feet <eos>

I'm walkin' back to Georgia <eos> And I hope, she will take me back <eos> Nothin' in my pockets <eos> And all I own is upon my back <eos> But she's the girl who said she loved me <eos> On that hot dusty Macon road <eos> And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down <eos> With that hard lovin' Georgia girl <eos> I'm walkin' back to Georgia <eos> She's the only one who knows <eos> How it feels when you lose a dream <eos> And how it feels when you dream alone <eos> But she's the girl who said she loved me <eos> On that hot dusty Macon road <eos> And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down <eos> With that hard lovin' Georgia girl <eos> Georgia can you hear me callin' <eos> Oh, I'll be home in just a while <eos> And if I had to I'd be crawlin' <eos> Just to share another mornin' smile <eos> You're the girl who said you loved me <eos> On that hot dusty long ago <eos> And if you're still around, I'm gonna settle down <eos> With you my hard lovin' Georgia girl, because <eos> Because I'm walkin' back to Georgia <eos> And I hope she will take me back <eos> Nothin' in my pockets <eos> And all I own is upon my back <eos> But she's the girl who said she loved me <eos> On that hot dusty Macon road <eos> And if she's still around, I'm gonna settle down <eos> With that hard lovin' Georgia girl <eos> 
Even the old folks never knew <eos> Why they call it like they do <eos> I was wondering since the age of two <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> Copper head, copper beech <eos> Copper kettles sitting side by each <eos> Copper coil, cup o'Georgia peach <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> Half a mile down to Morgan Creek <eos> Leaning heavy on the end of the week <eos> Hercules and a hog-nosed snake <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> We were down on Copperline <eos> One Summer night on the Copperline <eos> Slip away past supper time <eos> Wood smoke and moonshine <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> One time I saw my Daddy dance <eos> Watched him moving like a man in a trance <eos> He brought it back from the war in France <eos> Down onto Copperline <eos> Branch water and tomato wine <eos> Creosote and turpentine <eos> Sour mash and new moon shine <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> First kiss ever I took <eos> Like a page from a romance book <eos> The sky opened and the earth shook <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> Down on Copperline yeah <eos> Took a fall from a windy height <eos> I only knew how to hold on tight <eos> And pray for love enough to last all night <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> Day breaks and the boys wakes up <eos> And the dog barks and the birds sings <eos> And the sap rises and the angels sigh, yeah <eos> I tried to go back, as if I could <eos> All spec house and plywood <eos> Tore up and tore up good <eos> Down on Copperline <eos> It doesn't come as a surprise to me <eos> It doesn't touch my memory <eos> Man I'm lifting up and rising free <eos> Down on over Copperline <eos> Half a mile down to Morgan Creek <eos> I'm only living for the end of the week <eos> Hercules and a hog-nosed snake <eos> Down on Copperline yeah <eos> Take me down on Copperline <eos> Oh down on Copperline <eos> Take me down on Copperline <eos> 
I took my love, took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain, and I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart rise above? <eos> Can I sail through the changing ocean tides? <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Hmmmm <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Oh, I'm getting older too <eos> I take my love, take it down <eos> Oh, climb a mountain and turn around <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> Oh, the landslide will bring it down <eos> 
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years <eos> And the slow parade of fears without crying <eos> Now I want to understand <eos> I have done all that I could <eos> To see the evil and the good without hiding <eos> You must help me if you can <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Tell me what is wrong <eos> Was I unwise to leave them open for so long? <eos> 'Cause I have wandered through this world <eos> And as each moment has unfurled <eos> I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams <eos> People go just where they will <eos> I never noticed them until I got this feeling <eos> That it's later than it seems <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Tell me what you see <eos> I hear their cries <eos> Just say if it's too late for me <eos> Doctor, my eyes <eos> Cannot see the sky <eos> Is this the prize <eos> For having learned how not to cry? <eos> 
He was born in the summer of his 27th year <eos> Comin’ home to a place he’d never been before <eos> He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again <eos> You might say he found a key for every door <eos> When he first came to the mountains his life was far away <eos> On the road and hangin’ by a song <eos> But the string’s already broken and he doesn’t really care <eos> It keeps changin’ fast and it don’t last for long <eos> But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullabye <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below <eos> He saw everything as far as you can see <eos> And they say he got crazy once, and he tried to touch the sun <eos> And he lost a friend but kept the memory <eos> Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams <eos> Seeking grace in every step he takes <eos> His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand <eos> The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake <eos> And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Talk to God and listen to the casual reply <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear <eos> Of the simple thing he cannot comprehend <eos> Why they try to tear the mountains down <eos> To bring in a couple more <eos> More people, more scars upon the land <eos> And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Though he'd be a poorer man if he never saw eagles fly <eos> Rocky Mountain high <eos> The Colorado Rocky Mountain high <eos> I’ve seen it rainin’ fire in the sky <eos> Friends around the campfire and everybody's high (high  high) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (in Colorado) <eos> Rocky Mountain high (high Colorado) <eos> 
And now I know <eos> "Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say <eos> I thought I knew <eos> But now I know that rose trees never grow <eos> In New York City <eos> Until you've seen this trash can dream come true <eos> You stand at the edge while people run you through <eos> And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you <eos> I thank the Lord there's people out there like you <eos> While Mona Lisas and mad hatters <eos> Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers <eos> Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night <eos> For unless they see the sky <eos> But they can't, and that is why <eos> They know not if it's dark outside or light <eos> This Broadway's got <eos> It's got a lot of songs to sing <eos> If I knew the tunes, I might join in <eos> I'd go my way alone <eos> I'd grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City <eos> Subway's no way for a good man to go down <eos> Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown <eos> And I thank the Lord for the people I have found <eos> I thank the Lord for the people I have found <eos> While Mona Lisas and mad hatters <eos> Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers <eos> Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night <eos> For unless they see the sky <eos> But they can't, and that is why <eos> They know not if it's dark outside or light <eos> And now I know <eos> "Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say <eos> I thought I knew <eos> But now I know that rose trees never grow <eos> In New York City <eos> Subway's no way for a good man to go down <eos> Rich man can ride, and the hobo, he can drown <eos> And I thank the Lord for the people I have found <eos> I thank the Lord for the people I have found <eos> While Mona Lisas and mad hatters <eos> Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers <eos> Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night <eos> For unless they see the sky <eos> But they can't, and that is why <eos> They know not if it's dark outside or light <eos> They know not if it's dark outside or light <eos>

When I get off of this mountain <eos> You know where I want to go <eos> Straight down the Mississippi river <eos> To the Gulf of Mexico <eos> To Lake Charles Louisiana <eos> Little Bessie, girl that I once knew <eos> She told me just to come on by <eos> If there's anything that she could do <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> Good luck had just stung me <eos> To the race track I did go <eos> She bet on one horse to win <eos> And I bet on another to show <eos> The odds were in my favor <eos> I had 'em five to one <eos> When that nag to win came around the track <eos> Sure enough we had won <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> I took up all of my winnings <eos> And I gave my little Bessie half <eos> And she tore it up and threw it in my face <eos> Just for a laugh <eos> Now there's one thing in the whole wide world <eos> I sure love to see <eos> That's when that little love of mine <eos> Dips her doughnut in my tea <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> Now me and my mate were back at the shack <eos> We had Spike Jones on the box <eos> She said, "I can't take the way he sings <eos> But I love to hear him talk" <eos> Now that just gave my heart a throb <eos> To the bottom of my feet <eos> And I swore as I took another pull <eos> My Bessie can't be beat <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, as she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, as she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, as she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> As there's a flood out in California <eos> And up North it's freezing cold <eos> And this living on the road <eos> Is getting pretty old <eos> So I guess, I'll call up my big mama <eos> Tell her I'll be rolling in <eos> But you know, deep down <eos> I'm kind of tempted <eos> To go and see my Bessie again <eos> Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me <eos> If I spring a leak, she mends me <eos> I don't have to speak, she defends me <eos> A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one <eos> 
Some folks like to get away <eos> Take a holiday from the neighborhood <eos> Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood <eos> But I'm taking a Greyhound <eos> On the Hudson River line <eos> I'm in a New York state of mind <eos> I've seen all the movie stars <eos> In their fancy cars and their limousines <eos> Been high in the Rockies <eos> Under the evergreens <eos> I know what I'm needing <eos> And I don't want to waste more time <eos> I'm in a New York state of mind <eos> It was so easy living day by day <eos> Out of touch with the rhythm and blues <eos> But now I need a little give and take <eos> The New York Times, the Daily News <eos> It comes down to reality <eos> And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide <eos> I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside <eos> I don't have any reasons I left them all behind <eos> I'm in a New York state of mind <eos> It was so easy living day by day <eos> Out of touch with the rhythm and blues <eos> But now I need a little give and take <eos> The New York Times, The Daily News <eos> It comes down to reality <eos> And it's fine with me 'cause I've let it slide <eos> I don't care if it's Chinatown or on Riverside <eos> I don't have any reasons I left them all behind <eos> I'm in a New York state of mind <eos> I'm just taking a Greyhound <eos> On the Hudson River line <eos> Because I'm in a, I'm in a New York <eos> State of mind, yeah <eos>

Take me to the ocean <eos> Take me to the sea <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be free <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be... <eos> What now, it’s coming around <eos> You’re feeling cut down into the ground <eos> So we all come together, we’re making a sound <eos> We sing “Look at all this love we’ve found” <eos> Gotta raise em up, toast to the sweet life <eos> If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right <eos> See the sun giving me the green light <eos> To kick back, relax and soak up the sweet sights <eos> There’s something in the air <eos> Come and take away my cares <eos> I close my eyes <eos> Remember these dreams that we share <eos> I wash it all away <eos> You gotta give us all a break <eos> Let the troubles of tomorrow <eos> Wait till another day <eos> When life’s moving to fast <eos> We can make this dream last <eos> Just let the past be the past <eos> Just leave it all behind <eos> 
Love is a battle, at least they told me so <eos> How to surrender, sometimes I never know <eos> The walls up around me, they seem to never fall <eos> Lend me some fire so I can burn 'em all <eos> I know we've been struggling but hey, we've gotta move <eos> I can still see you now, can you see me too? <eos> Remember the rivers and how they merged our hearts <eos> Never apart <eos> 'Cause we came for morе than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for morе than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> I can feel the fear on every single breath <eos> Sometimes I feel like I can't take another step <eos> But darling, I'm a soldier <eos> I know that you're a soldier <eos> So let's climb up this mountain and get over <eos> All the things that keep us in the shadows, girl <eos> I intend to cut 'em out of both our worlds <eos> The mirror of the heart, it never lies <eos> Gotta purify our eyes and shine <eos> 'Cause we came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> (More than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love <eos> More than love <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love <eos> More than love <eos>

Force my feet to keep on moving <eos> Sounds so sweet when the beat starts grooving <eos> Time flies by, but life is such <eos> I've been thinking that I drink too much <eos> I hold my breath but I'm still breathing <eos> Life or death, it never come too easy <eos> Bide my time 'til the well runs dry <eos> I let the sun rays turn a dark soul bright <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine <eos> They said everything will be just fine <eos> I give my best and I give my all <eos> Feel like everything's all my fault <eos> Time stands still, but the clock keeps spinning <eos> I close my eyes and get lost for a minute <eos> The words and the tears, they have long dried up <eos> I think I thought that I'd had enough <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> Had a dream I was flying <eos> Where I go when I want to be free <eos> All this time I've been trying <eos> To escape to the place where I belong <eos> Shine on like the sun <eos> Holding on to a feeling <eos> Shine on, everyone <eos> Find love to believe in <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> Shine like the sun <eos> 
I was at the beach, sittin on the sand <eos> When I saw this girl, dark brown eyes and a dark olive tan <eos> She was watching the sets with a surfboard underneath her arm <eos> The first moment I saw her I knew she'd do me some harm <eos> (She's so good) <eos> She came out of the water with the best session I'd seen <eos> Man she had the biggest chi-chi's I had ever seen <eos> She put down her board, and sat down next to me <eos> And played a soft ole lonely tune on her ukulele <eos> I dont know what had happened, but I'd fallen asleep <eos> The next morning I woke up, she was sleeping next to me <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> She got out of bed and waxed up both our boards <eos> Grabbed me by the hand and then she took me out the door <eos> We surfed all that day long, at least eight hours straight <eos> Man I knew that she was the one and damn I couldn't wait <eos> Well I asked if she loved me <eos> She said, "Yea well I guess" <eos> So I asked her to marry me, dammit you know she said "Yes" <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> I was at the alter, in my tuxedo-o-o <eos> Waiting for my surfer girl, man where did she go? <eos> Later on that day, a friend of me did tell-ell-ell <eos> That she went to Mexico <eos> To catch a, to catch a, to catch a 10 foot swell <eos> Ah That Bitch! <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> I'm so in love with her <eos> I fell in love with her <eos> My little surfer girl <eos> My surfer girl <eos>

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <eos> Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife <eos> And if it was an open-shut case <eos> I never would've known from that look on your face <eos> Lost in your current like a priceless wine <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in <eos> As if you were a mythical thing <eos> Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <eos> And there was one prize I'd cheat to win <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> They count me out time and time again <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> But I come back stronger than a '90s trend <eos> Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark <eos> Show me the places where the others gave you scars <eos> Now this is an open-shut case <eos> I guess I should've known from the look on your face <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> That's my man <eos> Yeah, that's my man <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> That's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> 
Thought when I grew up, I would be the same <eos> As the ones who gave me my last name <eos> I would not give in, I would not partake <eos> In the same old drugs everyone else takes <eos> I'm better than that, I'm better than that <eos> I'm livin' my life so I go to Heaven and never come back <eos> But look where I'm at, look where I'm at <eos> I'm livin' the life that I said I wouldn't and wanna go back <eos> I used to call my mom every Sunday <eos> So she knew her love wasn't far away <eos> But now I'm all fucked up out in LA <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> I used to not take chances with God's name <eos> But it's been so long since I last prayed <eos> And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> I wish I could shelter the boy I knew <eos> From the constant hell I'd put him through <eos> 'Cause I'm all grown up and I'm black and blue <eos> I could use some tape, I could use some glue <eos> I'm better than that, I'm better than that <eos> I should be livin' my life so I go to Heaven and never come back <eos> I used to call my mom every Sunday <eos> So she knew her love wasn't far away <eos> But now I'm all fucked up out in LA <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> I used to not take chances with God's name <eos> But it's been so long since I last prayed <eos> And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> I thought when I grew up, I would be the same <eos> As the ones who gave me my last name (Oh) <eos> I used to call my mom every Sunday <eos> So she knew her love wasn't far away (Far away) <eos> But now I'm all fucked up out in LA (Out in LA) <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say (Oh yeah, what other people say) <eos> I used to not take chances with God's name <eos> But it's been so long since I last prayed <eos> And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah) <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah (No, no, ooh) <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 'Cause I care more about what other people say <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Two weeks and I wait 'til the feeling hits <eos> Maybe I just haven't let it sink in <eos> For three years we were living together <eos> Held me like you'd hold me forever <eos> Didn't think that heartbreak would feel like this <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> From every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> But I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> Patience is a thing that I learned from you <eos> That some things can feel wrong even though they're true <eos> Went through all the hard times together <eos> Kept me calm when I'd lose my temper <eos> I'm just really grateful that I had you <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> Every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> And I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> I wish it did <eos> When I wish it did <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> From every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> And I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> I wish it did <eos> 
The day after you said, "Goodbye" <eos> All I did was lay in bed and cry <eos> But after one month, I started to move on <eos> And after two, I felt alright <eos> Then three months in, you were off my mind <eos> And month four and five, I was living my life <eos> I was better and didn't have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> The day after you had reached out <eos> I was broken for the second time around <eos> I prayed on the third day that I would be okay <eos> That I'd forget you were ever mine <eos> Oh, I don't think you realize <eos> How long I had to fight to be living my life <eos> To get better and never have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Do you remember? <eos> Remember? <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Do you remember? <eos> Remember? <eos> 
Yeah <eos> You and your friends, you live on the surface <eos> Act like you're perfect, everyone knows <eos> You're just like everyone else <eos> Except for you're better at taking photos <eos> Oh, oh, oh, yeah <eos> Why you gotta make everything a show? <eos> Man, you're so fucking fake, ah <eos> You don't mean a single thing you say, ah <eos> If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah <eos> And you're just like all the people that you hate <eos> You're so fake <eos> When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone <eos> Calling me up when you're getting drunk <eos> You say you're in love, but what do you mean? <eos> 'Cause when you wake up, you blame it on drugs <eos> And then we break up, you lie through your teeth <eos> You just wanna play little games for attention <eos> (You just wanna play little games for attention) <eos> Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time <eos> 'Cause you're so fucking fake, ah <eos> You don't mean a single thing you say, ah <eos> If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah <eos> And you're just like all the people that you hate <eos> You're so fake <eos> When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone <eos> You just wanna play little games for attention <eos> (You just wanna play little games for attention) <eos> Pushing me away so I crave your affection <eos> (Pushing me away so I crave your affection) <eos> Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions <eos> (Calling me insane, but you stay in my mentions) <eos> Telling me your perfect lies and wasting all my time <eos> 'Cause you're so fucking fake, ah <eos> You don't mean a single thing you say, ah (Oh) <eos> If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah (Oh) <eos> And you're just like all the people that you hate <eos> You're so fake (Woo) <eos> When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos>

If we never met <eos> I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else’s bed <eos> I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends <eos> I wouldn't even know what love is <eos> If we never met <eos> What if I never started singing? <eos> What if you never told your family you were leaving? <eos> When you felt the pressure <eos> There’s a million different reasons <eos> We shouldn't be together <eos> But when I put it all together <eos> It all comes back to you, you, you <eos> I love it when the only light is me, you, and the moon <eos> And baby, when I close my eyes, I'm thinkin' about... <eos> If we never met <eos> I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed <eos> I'd be lost in a crowded room of fake friends <eos> I wouldn't even know what love is <eos> If we never met <eos> What if I never left Nashville? <eos> What if you never called me back when I asked you? <eos> Somethin’ stupid ’bout the weather <eos> It all happened for a reason <eos> 'Cause you put me back together <eos> But when I put it all together <eos> It all comes back to you, you, you <eos> I love it when the only light is me, you, and the moon <eos> And baby, when I close my eyes, I’m thinkin' about... <eos> If we never met <eos> I'd be drunk, waking up in someone else's bed <eos> I’d be lost in a crowded room of fake friends <eos> I wouldn't even know what love is <eos> If we never met <eos> 
You broke me first <eos> Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a while, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first (You broke me first) <eos> You broke me first, ooh oh <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> 
You say I spend too much time <eos> In my head and it holds me back <eos> I think you spend too much time <eos> Givin' me second chances that <eos> I don't deserve <eos> And it hurts <eos> You give me the kinda love that I never had <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that, mmm <eos> Wish that I could love like <eos> You, that weekend, we were sleeping <eos> In that London hotel room <eos> Heard you singing in the shower <eos> Damn near broke my heart in two <eos> And I don't deserve you <eos> And it hurts to <eos> Get the kinda love that you never had <eos> Wish that you could give, give, give it back <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> Ah-ooh, wish that I could love like that <eos> But look at us, we're in a room half-crowded <eos> And I wish that I could finish what we started <eos> But I don't know how <eos> To give the kinda love that you deserve <eos> Knowing that I can't just makes it worse <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You are perfect <eos> Wish that I could <eos> You are perfect <eos> Wish that I could <eos> 
Three little birds sat on my window <eos> And they told me I don't need to worry <eos> Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet <eos> Little girls double-dutch on the concrete <eos> Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right <eos> The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same <eos> Don't you hesitate <eos> Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song <eos> You go ahead, let your hair down <eos> Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams <eos> Just go ahead, let your hair down <eos> You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow <eos> Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely <eos> Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax) <eos> Don't you let those other boys fool you <eos> Gotta love that afro hairdo <eos> Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right <eos> The more you stay the same, the more that they seem to change <eos> Don't ya think it's strange? <eos> Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song <eos> You go ahead, let your hair down <eos> Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams <eos> Just go ahead, let your hair down <eos> You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow <eos> Just more than I could take, pity for pity's sake <eos> Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger <eos> When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer? <eos> Do what you want to <eos> Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song <eos> Just go ahead, let your hair down <eos> Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams <eos> Just go ahead, let your hair down <eos> You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow <eos>

Usually a drink will do the trick <eos> Take the edge off quick, sittin' in the dark <eos> With a shared cigarette <eos> Seeing eye-to-eye and heart-to-heart <eos> But maybe I'm just gettin' old <eos> Used to work, but now it don't <eos> A long gone drive <eos> You know the kind where you take a turn <eos> And you don't know why <eos> But it clears your mind, a surefire cure <eos> I need somethin' stronger <eos> That'll last a little longer <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> I wish I didn't know so much <eos> I peeked behind the curtain <eos> Now that magic rush <eos> Feels like a trick that isn't workin' <eos> But I haven't lost all hope yet <eos> Yeah, it's hurtin', but it ain't dead <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason <eos> Just somethin' that I can believe in <eos> I could use a love song <eos> That takes me back, just like that <eos> When it comes on <eos> To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes <eos> At a guy and a girl <eos> Who make it work in a world <eos> That for me so far just seems to go so wrong <eos> Yeah, I could use <eos> Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song <eos> 
We've been to both Carolinas <eos> Seen a big Montana sky <eos> Driven up and down a coast a few times <eos> London, Paris, paradise <eos> But ain't got much memory of the scenes <eos> Come to think, I miss them all <eos> And damn, babe, it's all your fault <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach? <eos> You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea <eos> And the night rolled in <eos> And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall <eos> But God, I saw all I needed to <eos> Might as well have stayed in the room <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Don't you remember Times Square? <eos> And people counting down everywhere <eos> 2000-whatever, no, I didn't care <eos> 'Cause baby you were there <eos> And once again, couldn't help but stare <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> Halfway around the world <eos> Or the local corner booth <eos> Yeah, you guessed it, girl <eos> You know I got my eyes on you <eos> We could be on any street <eos> Any party, any room <eos> I'll be there all night with my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> 
Well, all the parties on the streets are talkin' <eos> Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights <eos> We used to smoke while we were jay-walking <eos> Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night <eos> Knew the bands so we never payed our cover <eos> Wrote our names on the bathroom tiles <eos> We never dressed to impress all the others <eos> They would let us in on our laid back kinda style <eos> But boy, you know it's been a while <eos> And I don't know why you don't take me downtown <eos> Like you got anywhere better to be <eos> You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round <eos> Like a good time tease <eos> I'm only counting on your cancellation <eos> When I should be counting on you at my door <eos> Did you forget about how we went around? <eos> I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore <eos> Oh, anymore <eos> I got some platforms sitting in the corner <eos> They wanna stroll on a city sidewalk <eos> I got a dress that'll show a little uh-uh <eos> But you ain't getting uh-uh <eos> If you don't come pick me up (Damn) <eos> Show me off (Wow) <eos> You might be tired, but I'm not <eos> And I don't know why you don't take me downtown <eos> Like you got anywhere better to be <eos> You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round <eos> Like a good time tease <eos> I'm only counting on your cancellation <eos> When I should be counting on you at my door <eos> Did you forget about how we went around? <eos> I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore <eos> And I don't know why you don't take me downtown <eos> Like you got anywhere better to be <eos> Talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round <eos> Like a good time tease <eos> I'm only counting on your cancellation <eos> When I should be counting on you at my door <eos> Did you forget about how we went around? <eos> I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore <eos> Oh, anymore <eos> Yeah, don't know why you don't take me downtown <eos> I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore <eos> I just don't get it <eos> 
Every Sunday I see people <eos> Filing in through those front doors <eos> Got a cross up on that steeple <eos> Yeah, it's time to praise the Lord <eos> Some watch it on their TV <eos> Sittin' on the couch <eos> Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out <eos> Oh, ain't got too many miles to go <eos> To save my soul <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Now there ain't nothing wrong <eos> With puttin' on your Sunday best <eos> Me, I won't be wearin' <eos> Nothin' that I can't get wet <eos> I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone <eos> I'm out here by myself, but I know I'm not alone <eos> Yeah, I got all the proof I need <eos> And it sure makes me believe <eos> When I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Amen <eos> I'm in heaven watching all these waves roll in <eos> Amen <eos> When I'm lost I know where to get found again <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> 
Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend <eos> I've cut down crying to every other weekend <eos> Thanks for asking how I've been <eos> I've gotten too good at hiding it <eos> With an "I'm okay", "things are great" <eos> But the truth is <eos> Yeah, the truth is <eos> I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken <eos> Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open <eos> I still got fear inside of me <eos> I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright <eos> For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine <eos> I'm doin' fine <eos> Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19 <eos> And Mama drove north to find a new beginning <eos> I blamed God, I blamed myself <eos> Then I found my knees and prayed like hell <eos> It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing <eos> Yeah, I'm healing <eos> I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken <eos> Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open <eos> I still got fear inside of me <eos> I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright <eos> For the first time, in a long time, I'm doin' fine <eos> I'm doin' fine, oh-oh, oh-oh <eos> All these old pains <eos> And I wish they'd go away <eos> But I guess you can't be free without a fight <eos> I'm doin' fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken <eos> Fine enough to learn hearts are best when they're wide open <eos> I still got fear inside of me <eos> I'm not okay, but I'm gonna be alright <eos> Oh, for the first time, in a long, long time, I'm doin' fine <eos> I'm doin' fine <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend <eos> But I'm doin' fine <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> 
Lights go down, wheels go 'round <eos> I'm taking you home <eos> Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now <eos> I'm not ready to shut it down <eos> The way the dashboard glow <eos> Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind <eos> And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot <eos> Stop this car and throw it in park and just <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> (Slow dance in a parking lot) <eos> A half song gone, one door open, across the lot <eos> A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car <eos> Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time <eos> To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks <eos> You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman" <eos> And I don't care what song comes next <eos> I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> And get close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just <eos> A slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> 
If you ain't got two kids by 21 <eos> You're probably gonna die alone <eos> At least that's what tradition told you <eos> And it don't matter if you don't believe <eos> Come Sunday morning you best be <eos> There in the front row, like you're s'posed to <eos> Same hurt in every heart <eos> Same trailer, different park <eos> Mama's hooked on Mary Kay <eos> Brother's hooked on Mary Jane <eos> And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down <eos> Mary Mary quite contrary <eos> We get bored so we get married <eos> And just like dust we settle in this town <eos> On this broken merry go 'round <eos> And 'round and 'round we go <eos> Where it stops nobody knows <eos> And it ain't slowin' down <eos> This merry go 'round <eos> We think the first time's good enough <eos> So we hold on to high school love <eos> Say we won't end up like our parents <eos> Tiny little boxes in a row <eos> Ain't what you want it's what you know <eos> Just happy in the shoes you're wearin' <eos> Same checks we're always cashin' <eos> To buy a little more distraction <eos> 'Cause Mama's hooked on Mary Kay <eos> Brother's hooked on Mary Jane <eos> And Daddy's hooked on Mary two doors down <eos> Mary Mary quite contrary <eos> We get bored so we get married <eos> And just like dust we settle in this town <eos> On this broken merry go 'round <eos> And 'round and 'round we go <eos> Where it stops nobody knows <eos> And it ain't slowin' down <eos> This merry go 'round <eos> Mary Mary quite contrary <eos> We're so bored until we're buried <eos> And just like dust we settle in this town <eos> On this broken merry go 'round <eos> And 'round and 'round we go <eos> Where it stops nobody knows <eos> And it ain't slowin' down <eos> This merry go 'round <eos> Jack and Jill went up the hill <eos> Jack burned out on booze and pills <eos> And Mary had a little lamb <eos> Mary just don't give a damn no more <eos> 
Heading down south to the land of the pines <eos> I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline <eos> Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights <eos> I made it down the coast in seventeen hours <eos> Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers <eos> And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Running from the cold up in New England <eos> I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band <eos> My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now <eos> Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down <eos> Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town <eos> But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Walking to the south out of Roanoke <eos> I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke <eos> But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap <eos> To Johnson City, Tennessee <eos> And I got to get a move on before the sun <eos> I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one <eos> And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> You can rock me <eos> Rock me <eos>

Quarter in a payphone <eos> Drying laundry on the line <eos> Watching Sun Tea in the window <eos> Pocket watch tellin time <eos> Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette <eos> Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet <eos> If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress <eos> We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas <eos> God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be <eos> I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos> If you had something to say <eos> You'd write it on a piece of paper <eos> Then you'd put a stamp on it <eos> And they'd get it three days later <eos> Boys would call the girls <eos> And girls would turn them down <eos> Staying married was the only way to work your problems out <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos> Automatic <eos> Let's pull the windows down <eos> Windows with the cranks <eos> Come on let's take a picture <eos> The kind you gotta shake <eos> Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn <eos> Doing it all by hand <eos> Cause when everything is handed to you <eos> It's only worth as much as the time put in <eos> It all just seemed so good the way we had it <eos> Back before everything became automatic <eos> 
Baby, last night was hands down <eos> One of the best nights that I've had, no doubt <eos> Between the bottle of wine and the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye <eos> Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain <eos> And I know that I can't ever tell you enough <eos> That all I need in this life is your crazy love <eos> If I never get to see the Northern Lights <eos> Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night <eos> Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand <eos> Baby, I could die a happy man <eos> A happy man, baby, mmm <eos> Baby, that red dress brings me to my knees <eos> Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe <eos> You’re a saint, you’re a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece <eos> It's too good to be true, nothing better than you in my wildest dreams <eos> And I know that I can't ever tell you enough <eos> That all I need in this life is your crazy love <eos> If I never get to see the Northern Lights <eos> Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night <eos> Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand <eos> Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah <eos> Mmm <eos> I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination <eos> Baby, you're my great escape <eos> We could stay at home, listen to the radio <eos> Dance around the fireplace <eos> Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia <eos> Or drive a sports car up the coast of California <eos> Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand <eos> Baby, I could die a happy man <eos> Baby, I could die a happy man <eos> Oh, I could die a happy man <eos> You know I could, girl <eos> I could die, I could die a happy man <eos> Mmm <eos>

Hold myself to a chord <eos> Waiting for the day that you come back to me <eos> You know that I don’t give a fuck about appearances <eos> Been hearing things about you <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> Move in step across the floor <eos> Waiting here to say that you can’t handle me <eos> You know I never understood why you would say these things <eos> I don’t feel the same without you <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> You’ve been dreamin’ come with me I’ll help you wake up <eos> And you know that it’s true, your feeling <eos> If you want to get it along <eos> It’s true <eos> 
They say that I'm wasted potential <eos> Meant to make my days all eventful <eos> But sometimes I can’t help but stay at home <eos> Toke on buds to cope with my mental <eos> She says that I'm kind and I'm gentle <eos> But really I’m just scared to be alone <eos> Maybe if I tell you that I hate you, then you'll give me my space <eos> Maybe if I say I love you, then you'll throw it back in my face <eos> I'm a homebody, don't owe nobody nothin' <eos> Thought she was bluffin', but she really took my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I'm a homebody, don’t go nobody’s functions <eos> And she comes to the junction just to take my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I might step out in my sliders, ain't goin’ nowhere <eos> Please don't ask me how my mind is <eos> 'Cause you don't care <eos> I need someone to confide in, someone I can trust <eos> ’Cause I'm getting sick of hidin' <eos> Maybe if I tell you that I hate you then you'll give me my space <eos> Maybe if I say I love you then you'll throw it back in my face <eos> I'm a homebody, don't owe nobody nothin' <eos> Thought she was bluffing but she really took my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I'm a homebody, don't go nobody's functions <eos> And she comes to the junction just to take my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> 
You would use your songs to say <eos> The words you couldn't say <eos> And every word you sang <eos> Was about you and me <eos> I loved everything you've wrote <eos> And when you would sing <eos> I felt that my heart was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> And with Cristal and pink champagne <eos> On our wedding day <eos> You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us <eos> Then you got on top of it <eos> And you sang to me <eos> As the snow was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> 
Pull me in the water, feeling so divine <eos> Trust is gonna follow through the door or mind <eos> So what if I feel too much? <eos> So what if I say too much? <eos> Something 'bout the way we touch <eos> I can never get enough <eos> Take me to your <eos> Island vibing, sunrise driving <eos> Baby, I'm yours <eos> Island vibing, sunrise driving <eos> Sunrise driving <eos> Sunrise driving <eos> Underneath the night sky, staring at the moon <eos> Coming with the colours, painting me and you <eos> Breathing against my neck give me shivers <eos> Even this connection wouldn't let you ride the river <eos> So what if I feel too much? <eos> So what if I say too much? <eos> Something 'bout the way we touch <eos> I can never get enough <eos> Take me to your <eos> Island vibing, sunrise driving <eos> Baby, I'm yours <eos> Island vibing, sunrise driving <eos> Yeah yeah, sunrise driving <eos> Sunrise driving <eos> 
Walking on water <eos> Holding you near <eos> I'm hoping if God don't break you <eos> We can stay right here <eos> 'Cause your love is like rain on my skin <eos> It softens the surface <eos> Sinking fast don't know how to act <eos> In this overcast <eos> When I drift away from you <eos> You pull me back <eos> But we'll never last <eos> 'Cause I'm going mad <eos> As I lose myself in you <eos> Rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> I need some company <eos> Oh rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> Think I need some company <eos> How could you know me <eos> I barely know myself <eos> You know when to hold me <eos> I didn't ask for help <eos> How could you know me <eos> Console me <eos> Show me you're the only one <eos> Who ever put me first <eos> Ever knew my worth <eos> I lie awake in bed <eos> Silencing <eos> The doubt that's running circles in my head <eos> Trying not to wake you up <eos> But how could I forget? <eos> You hold all the water in your hands <eos> Oh rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> I need some company <eos> Oh rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> Think I need some company <eos> Come and give me company <eos> Rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> I need some company <eos> Oh rain <eos> Won't you come to me <eos> Think I need some company <eos> 
Çocuktum masum hayallerim vardı <eos> Mesela her çocuk gibi futbolcu olmak <eos> Mahalle aralarında top yuvarlardık <eos> Cam kırardık, çok can sıkardık <eos> Çocuktum masum oyunlar oynardık <eos> Mesela külah atardık Ermeni'ye <eos> Boncuklu tabancalarımız vardı, mermi değil <eos> Doğal olarak eşit görüyorduk her bireyi <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk. Ne bilelim ayrım gayrım <eos> Bir çocuğun bilmediği tek şey ayrılmaydı <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk be amına koyayım, en azından <eos> Masum olmak gerektiğinin farkındaydık <eos> Nasıl bir çocukmuşuz yetişkinden öte <eos> Bizim tek derdimiz saklambaç oynarken bir sote! <eos> Velhasıl kelam <eos> Çocukken sual şimdi insan olmak ödev <eos> Çocuktum sen bilir misin bir futbolcu kartının <eos> Küçük bir çocuk için ne ifade ettiğini? <eos> Sek sek mermerinin bozuk bir asfaltta, saniyede kaç ivmeyle kaç defa sektiğini? <eos> Bilir misin karanlık bir köşe başında, ilk dumanı ciğerlerime 10 yaşımda çektiğimi? <eos> Nerden bile bilirdim mahalledeki abilerin ruh ve beden sağlığına nifak tohumu ektiğini! <eos> Ey gidi Trabzon! <eos> Boztepe'nin manzarasını inan hayal edemezdi Picasso <eos> 14 yaşındaydım, küçük bir arka mahalleden koca bir metropole geçiş yapmak biraz zordu <eos> Be İstanbul şiir gibisin de okumak ne mümkün! <eos> Ne hengamesi, ne malı, ne mülkü! <eos> Bu şehir milyonlarca insan içinde, yalnızlığın bestelendiği, enstrümanı kalabalığın sesi olan bir türkü! <eos> 
Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul <eos> He said I'm there before my time <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> I'm running out of reasons to start up a conversation with you <eos> Usually, I'd be the first to run to your defense <eos> But this time, I can't even come up with an excuse <eos> Tengo que vivir un día a la vez, poco a poco <eos> Otherwise, I'd lose my head <eos> And I'd start doubting everything that I believe in <eos> Believe me (No, no, no, no) <eos> Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul (Old soul) <eos> He said I'm there before my time (Time) <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> You push me to a side, why do I wait <eos> For you to come around and talk again? <eos> Mess with my mind, I'll move myself out of your way <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> I'd just rather not confront them because then they bring us problems <eos> And they're always in the back of my head <eos> Are you bored yet? Are you leaving? <eos> It's kinda shifted, I feel the difference <eos> Don't want attachment to you, no <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> Just yet, mm <eos> 
The days are drifting slowly by <eos> I guess I'll be here till July <eos> I find it hard to have no answers <eos> But the thought of us can make the time go by <eos> We could walk but in garden <eos> We could talk while at the market <eos> Taking moments of our days to be alone <eos> And while we don't have all the answers <eos> We still know what truly matters <eos> Keeping hope alive despite the darkest storm <eos> The days are drifting slowly by <eos> I guess I'll be here till July <eos> I find it hard to have no answers <eos> But the thought of us can make the time go by <eos> Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by <eos> Yeah, the thought of us can make the time go by <eos>

When the lights are low <eos> I'm alone with the feeling <eos> Can you be the relief I can't find <eos> 'cause I don't know the answer sometimes <eos> Can I take control <eos> And hold on to believing <eos> Yeah I know it can look like I'm trying <eos> Though I can't seem to make up my mind <eos> Let's go <eos> To another coast <eos> Take me somewhere we can be alone <eos> Baby there where we get comfortable <eos> There's nothing to lose except our clothes <eos> And I really wanna let you know <eos> That I can never let you go <eos> 'cause I just wanna be only yours <eos> And maybe I'll surrender <eos> 'cause loving you is better <eos> It's not worth it to fight it <eos> I'm giving up <eos> Let's go <eos> To another coast <eos> Take me somewhere we can be alone <eos> Baby there where we get comfortable <eos> There's nothing to lose except our clothes <eos> And I really wanna let you know <eos> That I can never let you go <eos> 'cause I just wanna be only yours <eos> Entre truenos y tormentas <eos> Fue la calma que existía entre nosotros <eos> Lo que nos dejó fluir <eos> 
You don't need to pretend, know you don't want to be friends with me <eos> Don't get defensive, I don't mean to offend, baby <eos> I'm all you want, all you need, so I guess it depends <eos> Don't make me ask you again, again <eos> Plant rosebuds on my cheek, I'll blush like rosé wine <eos> And if you water them enough, I promise we'll be fine <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yеah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> Straight out of the '90s, definition of brown sugar <eos> Hand on your thigh whеn I am driving downtown with you <eos> Everything's right, soon as those bedroom lights get dimmer, dimmer, oh <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yeah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> You can have anything you want (Anything you want) <eos> Anything from you want from me is yours <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy (Crazy), yeah, I'm crazy for you (Crazy) <eos> Approach me, baby (Ah), I'm crazy for you, crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy (Crazy, crazy) <eos> You can go, go (Crazy, crazy, crazy) crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da <eos>

We never got it right <eos> We never got it wrong <eos> All those nights we'd fight <eos> We'd never let it go <eos> Feel the rain pour down <eos> Watch it tear through the light <eos> Watch the clouds float by <eos> And leave you cold in the night <eos> And leave you cold in the night <eos> We never got it right <eos> We never got it wrong <eos> All those nights we'd fight <eos> We'd never let it go <eos> Feel the rain pour down <eos> Watch it tear through the light <eos> Watch the clouds float by <eos> And leave you cold in the night <eos> And leave you cold in the night <eos> You'll be alright I'll keep you warm <eos> You'll be alright I'll keep you warm <eos> 
The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> I don't know that much about Kingston <eos> But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain <eos> I think that tonight I'll leave my light on <eos> 'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you <eos> Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way <eos> It's the thought of you that slightly scares me <eos> But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say <eos> The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> 
Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!) <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> That's the way every day goes <eos> Every time we've no control <eos> If the sky is pink and white <eos> If the ground is black and yellow <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Nod my head, don't close my eyes <eos> Halfway on a slow move <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> If you could fly, then you'd feel south <eos> Up north's getting cold soon <eos> The way it is, we're on land <eos> Still I'm someone to hold true <eos> Keep you cool when it's still alive <eos> Won't let you down when it's all ruin <eos> Just the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> In the wake of a hurricane <eos> Dark skin of a summer shade <eos> Nosedive into flood lines <eos> Tall tower of milk crates <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Cannonball off the porch side <eos> Older kids trying off the roof <eos> Just the same way you showed me (You showed) <eos> If you could die and come back to life <eos> Up for air from the swimming pool <eos> You'd kneel down to the dry land <eos> Kiss the Earth that birthed you <eos> Gave you tools just to stay alive <eos> And make it out when the sun is ruined <eos> That's the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> Remember life, remember how it was <eos> Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here <eos> Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob <eos> Say what up to Danny <eos> Say what up to life immortality <eos> Bending up my Nikes <eos> Running out the melpomene, nicotine <eos> Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy) <eos> Gimme something sweet <eos> Bitch, I might like immortality <eos> This is life, life immortality <eos> 
Loving you is a mountain <eos> We don't have breath in our lungs <eos> The higher up we go is the problem <eos> So maybe we should fly to the sun <eos> I just don't believe we can function <eos> There is no life if there's an absence of blood <eos> And I don't even feel our hearts beating <eos> So maybe there is an absence of love <eos> 
Oh this perfume, must be something sacred <eos> To linger after you, like it do <eos> This scent's been buried where I rest my head <eos> Pretend to forget but it still feels like you <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Sleep much longer than I did before <eos> Though haunted are dreams evermore <eos> Bless these angels hanging over my head <eos> Still as a tomb though, I'm scared instead <eos> ('Cause) <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Oh you left so much behind <eos> I must be losing my mind, Oh <eos> 
This world can take you <eos> Need an arm round your neck, somebody you can talk to <eos> When it shakes you <eos> When no one else will say it and you need to hear the truth <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Scared to fail you <eos> Clock's countin' down and I think I got everything to prove <eos> Been a friend of trouble <eos> After losing it all, I got nothing else to lose <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> You can count on me, I can count on you <eos> To help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> You can count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> (Help you lay down what you held on to) <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> (Help you lay down what you held on to) <eos> What you held on to <eos> 
We could be a gunfighter <eos> Unlatching all the bailing wire <eos> Eloise, lemme see your sweet face <eos> Come, face me <eos> Chin up, we're young & in the dark <eos> We saw him resurrect in a muscle car <eos> There was an oracle <eos> We heard there was a light show <eos> Hotter than a June kiss <eos> I'm blushing a shade of licorice <eos> Croon with your night lungs <eos> That old Cicada love song <eos> Holy broken heart <eos> A meaning-well American abattoir <eos> You're around us, oh <eos> Be around us <eos> Someone close our eyes <eos> Make it so that we can find you <eos> In our imagination, a magic eye <eos> In the photo under, we look like a gunfighter <eos> Modeled after Autry <eos> Maybe Annie O <eos> And we can trick-shoot bottles <eos> And everyone aims slow <eos> Oh, c'mon, be a gunfighter, baby <eos> With you <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos> For always <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos> Oh, oh, ooh <eos> We could be a gunfighter <eos> 
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh <eos> Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh <eos> Came in like a vision from the old west wind <eos> Like a bright new dream that I was steppin' in <eos> I saw your face, and I knew it was a sign <eos> And I still think about that moment <eos> All of the time <eos> Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh <eos> Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh <eos> You know that I could never make this up <eos> I found the reason and I'm not givin' it up <eos> I felt the fever, and I knew it was mine <eos> Oh I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> And in the mornin' when I'm waking up <eos> I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinkin' of <eos> I feel it in my body <eos> Know it in my mind, oh I <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Oh, I never knew it <eos> Yeah you took me by surprise <eos> While I was gettin' lost so deep inside your diamond eyes <eos> So many things that I still want to say <eos> And if devotion is a river <eos> Then I'm floating away <eos> And in the mornin' when you pick me up <eos> And all the world is quiet except the mourning dove <eos> I feel it in my body <eos> Know it in my mind, oh I <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Don't slow down now <eos> Come and break me down <eos> Keep your hands in my hair <eos> Keep your mouth on my mouth <eos> Don't slow this down <eos> Never let me go <eos> Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go? <eos> And in the mornin' when you wrap me up <eos> I know that forever could never be enough <eos> I feel it in my body <eos> Know it in my mind, oh I <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> For a long time <eos> Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Ooh, I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Yeah, I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Won't you keep lettin' me love you for a long time <eos> For a long, long, long, long time <eos> I'm gonna love you for a long time <eos> Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh <eos> Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh-ooh <eos> 
First cup of coffee after a long night <eos> First kiss after a bitter fight <eos> First time we see each other after too much time <eos> Something's gone, but we're still here and it's alright <eos> If this is a drug, keep me prescribed <eos> These are the side effects I want for life <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> First note you played on the midnight piano <eos> Our voices raised, holding the stars in place <eos> The first mile on the first road, where we let go <eos> First time we let our hearts race <eos> If this is a drug, keep me prescribed <eos> These are the side effects I want for life <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I know this moment is following the last one out <eos> Can't seem to hold it down <eos> I hope it stays around <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> 
Well, I'm an overthinker, a daydreamer <eos> A heavy drinker, an in-betweener <eos> Proppin' up the bar, like it's gonna fall down <eos> I'm a shit-talker, a bad joker <eos> A Johnny Walker, a chain smoker <eos> Everyone knows it all over town <eos> And I know we've just met <eos> And you don't know my deal yet <eos> But I wondered if you would <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos> 'Cause I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Until the mornin' light <eos> Help me remember to forget, yeah <eos> 'Cause I'm a future gazer, a past dweller <eos> And I've always been a storyteller <eos> But no one's listening anymore <eos> And I'm a latecomer, a last chancer <eos> A slow runner and a final dancer <eos> You see me glide across the floor <eos> And I know it sounds strange <eos> And I've got nothing to exchange <eos> But I wondered if you could <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos> And I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Until the mornin' light <eos> Help me remember to forget, ee yeah <eos> So help me remember to forget <eos> 'Cause I, I don't wanna wake up yet <eos> Stay with me through the night <eos> Till the morning light <eos> Help me remember to forget <eos> 
Honeybee <eos> Could you imagine where our lives would lead? <eos> That silly ring, it wasn't meant to be <eos> Luckily, you saw in me something I couldn't see <eos> Honeybee <eos> I can't imagine how my life would be <eos> If all your gravity did not hit me <eos> Oh, don't you see? Darling, my honeybee <eos> But here we are <eos> After all the messes and confessions <eos> To the stars <eos> That we never really owned as ours <eos> And if our world comes tumbling down <eos> I never could forgive myself for leaving out <eos> You're the one, you are the only one <eos> Such a fool <eos> I took your love and I bent all the rules <eos> You took the blow and didn't let it show <eos> Stuck around to let me know <eos> Built a family of our own <eos> Look around <eos> We made a garden of the love we found <eos> So many reasons I would fight to stay <eos> You're the courage when I fade <eos> Take a look at what we've made <eos> But here we are <eos> After all the messes and confessions <eos> To the scars <eos> That we never really owned as ours <eos> And if our world comes tumbling down <eos> I never could forgive myself for leaving out <eos> You're the one, you are the only one <eos> Won't you decide? <eos> Won't you decide? <eos> I want you to soar <eos> Don't doubt anymore <eos> (Little by little, we'll meet in the middle) <eos> Won't you decide? (If that's alright) <eos> Won't you decide? <eos> (I hope you can hear me, I needed you near me) <eos> I want you to soar (You save my life) <eos> Don't doubt anymore (Let's keep this between you and I) <eos> And if our world comes tumbling down <eos> I never could forgive myself for leaving out <eos> And if our world comes tumbling down <eos> (If our world comes tumbling down) <eos> I never could forgive myself for leaving out <eos> (I never could forgive myself) <eos> You're the one, you are the only one <eos> And if our world comes tumbling down <eos> (The world comes tumbling down) <eos> I never could forgive myself, I'll say it now <eos> (I never could forgive myself) <eos> You're the one, you are the only one <eos> 
Oh, I saw a shooting star <eos> Late last night <eos> Yeah, she was pointing at the west coast <eos> Beamin’ like a street light <eos> Got my white denim jacket <eos> And my bolo tie <eos> Snuck past mom and dad and told my little brothers goodbye <eos> Oh, I hear a motor car <eos> Coming up the coast <eos> You know I’ve seen other cities but I like this one most <eos> There’s a girl down the valley says that we can take it slow <eos> Or we can push fast forward on it <eos> Love, success, and rock and roll <eos> But it gets hard sometimes <eos> Don’t I know it <eos> I been up for a week <eos> I can’t get no sleep <eos> I lose my cool <eos> Oh, I saw a shooting star <eos> Late last night <eos> She’s like vanilla ice cream, baby <eos> Milky white <eos> I wanna love her all day <eos> And all of the night <eos> I wanna love her all day <eos> For the rest of my life <eos> And it gets hard sometimes <eos> Don’t I know it <eos> I been up for a week <eos> I can’t get no sleep <eos> I lose my cool <eos> I been up for a week <eos> I can’t get no sleep <eos> I lose my cool <eos> Say what you mean babe <eos> C’mon and tell it to me <eos> Ooh <eos> Ooh <eos> Sh-sh-sh-shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah <eos> Shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah <eos> Shoobie doobie doowah, shoobie doobie doowah <eos> Shoobie doobie doowah, yeah <eos> 
There’s a song in my head <eos> Oh, a line that never stops playing <eos> I’m not sure how it ends <eos> I can't remember when <eos> I heard what you were saying <eos> I make the best out of the worst <eos> I make up half the words <eos> And wear a t-shirt of a band I’ve never heard <eos> Because it hurts to be on the outside looking in <eos> Well, I do my best to listen <eos> But I’m uncomfortable with too much silence <eos> From the passenger seat, you said, "What does that mean?" <eos> I said I’m learning to live with the violence, violence <eos> But I’m not the kind that <eos> Wants to be lost, I don't wanna be forgotten <eos> I don’t wanna pretend that it's alright <eos> I wanna see these walls crumble and dissolve <eos> Around me <eos> I got my gold-rimmed diploma wearing a square crown <eos> The class of '14 wore their capes like a reverend’s gown <eos> All that education won’t help us now <eos> Attending funerals and watching friends break their vows <eos> Well, there’s not much that I can protect <eos> So I keep my good humor alive <eos> Nothing disturbs your intellect <eos> Like feeling something you can’t deny, justify <eos> I don’t wanna be lost, I don't wanna be forgotten <eos> I don’t wanna pretend that it’s alright <eos> I wanna see these walls crumble and dissolve <eos> Around me <eos> Saturday morning 11 AM <eos> Heard mom and dad talking money again <eos> Fit a seven person family in a five seater van <eos> I guess all you can do is the best that you can <eos> Dad pushed it all down with a Gibson in his hand <eos> To finish that song that never had an end <eos> I can still hear that song in my head <eos> In my head <eos> Information, education, given in love <eos> Questions digest like sugar in my blood <eos> Holding together what’s meant to fall apart <eos> Justify a reason for the way things are <eos> Well, I don’t wanna be lost <eos> I don’t wanna be forgotten <eos> I got reason to believe that I just might <eos> One day see these walls crumble and dissolve <eos> Around me <eos> I’m not afraid, not afraid to lose <eos> It’s a voice that I can’t refuse <eos> Maybe I don’t have a right to choose <eos> When it calls my name <eos> 
Baby, tell me what you want <eos> 'Cause I'm gonna give you all I got, girl <eos> Baby, tell me what you want <eos> Baby, tell me what you want <eos> It's sad to see my pretty girl looking so sad <eos> I wish that I could make it better <eos> Sometimes, all I want to be is your sunshine <eos> But I can be the rain, I'll fill you up to the top <eos> I'll give you all I got <eos> When you're running low on magical <eos> Maybe I can hold you tight <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> When the night's too much and you need a touch <eos> Baby, I can kiss you right <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> Baby, tell me what you want <eos> 'Cause I'm gonna give you all I got, girl <eos> Baby, tell me what you want <eos> Baby, tell me what you want <eos> My hands shaped like a puzzle you can fit in <eos> I want to be the pieces that you're missing <eos> Oh, I can see the picture that we're both in <eos> I could be the one to be the keys to your lock <eos> I'll give you all I got <eos> If you're running low on magical <eos> Maybe I can hold you tight <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> Just a little supply and demand <eos> When the night's too much and you need a touch <eos> Baby, I can kiss you right <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> Just try a little supply and demand <eos> If you're running low on magical <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Maybe I can hold you tight <eos> ('Cause I'm gonna give you all I got, girl) <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Just try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> When the night's too much and you need a touch <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Baby, I can kiss you right <eos> ('Cause I'm gonna give you all I got, girl) <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Just try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Ooh <eos> ('Cause I'm gonna give you all I got, girl) <eos> Try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> Just try a little supply and demand <eos> (Baby, tell me what you want) <eos> 
I came in from the outside, burned out from a joy ride <eos> She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway <eos> Played from the bedside is "Stella by Starlight" <eos> That was my heart, the drums that start off "Night and Day" <eos> The same kind of music haunts her bedroom <eos> I'm almost me again, she's almost you <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> Tell me who, and I'll be thanking them <eos> The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington <eos> Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing <eos> Let's get lost and let the good times roll <eos> Let smoke rings from this paper doll <eos> Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing <eos> I got some colour back, she thinks so, too <eos> I laugh like me again, she laughs like you <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't, mmm <eos> I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where <eos> I wouldn't know <eos> The very thought of you and am I blue? <eos> A love supreme seems far removed <eos> I get along without you very well some other nights <eos> Oh, the radio news reader chimes <eos> Reporting Russian lullabies <eos> She'll turn to me awake and ask, "Is everything alright?" <eos> And, Lord <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where) <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> I wouldn't know where to start <eos> Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where) <eos> Be still, my foolish heart <eos> Don't ruin this on me <eos> 
If there was anyone I'd want <eos> To spend about a hundred days with <eos> Laying in the yard, staring up at stars <eos> Wondering where all the planes went <eos> It would be you, only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms, in my arms (oh-oh) <eos> And we'll leave on the news until <eos> The broadcast stops broadcasting <eos> Yes, making drinks instead of plans <eos> While the record player's blasting <eos> I sing, it would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> And when the lights go out <eos> We'll just keep on dancing in the dark <eos> As if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> If the sky turns black, if the markets crash <eos> You should check your mom's house <eos> And then you should come back <eos> Cause when it all goes down <eos> I want you by my side <eos> We could stay up till the last sunrise <eos> We could stay up until the last sunrise <eos> It would be you, and only you <eos> We might not have forever <eos> No time for taking chances <eos> It would be you, and always you <eos> When the lights go out <eos> We can keep on dancing in the dark, in the dark, in the dark <eos> It would be you till the end of the world <eos> Till the end of the world, yeah <eos> Cause if the world has got to end <eos> You might as well just end up in my arms <eos> 
I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer <eos> There must be more behind the summer <eos> I want someone to make some trouble <eos> Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh <eos> Take me out and keep me up all night <eos> Let me live on the wilder side of the light <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> You carnivore, you loose cannon <eos> Can I have some more? I can't understand it <eos> You fast car, you foolish spender <eos> You know you are, and I surrender <eos> So come on over and wake me up <eos> Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup <eos> You know I need you, and that's for sure <eos> You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> (Where the sun hits my face all different) <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> Carry me away <eos> 
Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing <eos> You’re like Parker Posey in a magazine <eos> With fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three <eos> I wanna be your dressed in black <eos> Your dark star with the backwards hat <eos> I’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page <eos> Every page <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> I was a desert, honey you were the sand <eos> I was a bird, baby you were the branch <eos> And I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die <eos> It wasn't much, just everything <eos> You could've sat right there and got high with me <eos> But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares <eos> Brought the nightmares <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> 
There's an hourglass sitting on the table <eos> I'm watching as everything's changing <eos> My mind goes to a different time <eos> Old love I remember falling so madly <eos> There must've been magic in the valley <eos> And a rhythm in the night <eos> 'Cause I could almost see it <eos> Did you fade right out of view <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Sometimes there's shadows growing in my mind <eos> Like a sundial in the nighttime but if i close my eyes <eos> I think I still see it <eos> Sunlight coming through <eos> CHORUS <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> Oh if it takes time <eos> Where you go I'll keep on running <eos> I hope you know that I'll keep coming <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> If it takes time <eos> To get to you <eos> I'll get to you <eos> If it takes time <eos> 
You said we wouldn't even see the meteor <eos> At that speed just ask the dinosaurs how they liked it <eos> They didn't like it <eos> Or a tidal wave a hundred stories tall <eos> The point I'm trying to make <eos> Is the time that's upon us <eos> Is all that we're promised <eos> So I said, "Babe, if that's the case <eos> We don't have time to waste" <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> I'm tired of counting down streetlights till we kiss goodnight at your door anymore, it's <eos> The only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> I want to see your sleepy morning face <eos> Over coffee cups and scrambled eggs <eos> And I'Ll get the paper if you get the paper <eos> So we can read about the super genius scientists with laser beams <eos> Who totally saved us <eos> And blew that rock into space dust <eos> So I could be yours in the morning <eos> I'm tired of counting down streetlights till we kiss goodnight at your door anymore, it's <eos> The only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> In the afternoon, in the evening too, darling <eos> Could I be yours? <eos> Could I be yours in the morning? <eos> It's only thing I dream of when I close my eyes <eos> Dancing on the floor while the city sleeps <eos> Moving to the music of our opening scene <eos> I would fall in love, I'm just warning ya <eos> So could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Oh, could I be yours in the morning? <eos> Oh, could I be yours, darling? <eos> Oh, could I be yours? <eos> The point I'm trying to make <eos> Is the time that's upon us <eos> Is all that we're promised <eos> 
To the next generation, merry Christmas <eos> You're working harder than ever now and the coffee sucks <eos> You know Colombia and Kenya got too damn hot <eos> And now you're making do with what you've got <eos> Everybody knew <eos> Reading all the same headlines <eos> Blowing through the traffic signs <eos> Looking for the cops <eos> But what could you do? <eos> Can't you see it clear as glass? <eos> Going through it if we crash <eos> But we're never gonna stop <eos> Killer waves and riots <eos> Coming to the coastline soon <eos> Counting up the new typhoons <eos> Quicker than kilowatts <eos> How could you deny it? <eos> Living like your eyes are shut <eos> I guess it's hard to be a human <eos> It's еven harder to be not <eos> Whеn you're making do with what you've got <eos> Where are all the heroes? <eos> Perfect teeth glistening <eos> Big strong chins <eos> Shooting for the moonshots <eos> Like going sixty to zero <eos> Slowing down few and far between <eos> Everything true it seems like we forgot <eos> I don't wanna lie <eos> What do I say to my baby girl? <eos> Leaving her with half a world <eos> That we coulda done a lot? <eos> I just wanna die <eos> If she wants what she can't become <eos> And she can't blame anyone <eos> Because it's no one's fault <eos> When you're making do with what you've got <eos> You've gotta make it do a lot more than ever <eos> And you don't even know what you've lost <eos> A perfect paradise of too many guilty pleasures <eos> And you pay the cost, you pay the cost <eos> To the next generation, merry Christmas <eos> You're working harder than ever now <eos>

Momma says I'm up to no good again <eos> Couldn't make her proud, though I did my best <eos> I feel like a mess <eos> I feel like I'm stuck in the wrong skin <eos> I feel like I'm sick <eos> But I'm having trouble swallowing my own medicine <eos> Sunday, carry me, carry me down to the water <eos> And wash me clean, I'm still struggling <eos> Sunday, bury me under the weight of who you need me to be <eos> Can't you see I'm struggling? <eos> I keep God locked in a picture frame <eos> So I feel a little better about my numbered days <eos> Yeah, I confess <eos> The questions and the answers seem to the sound the same <eos> I'm just like the rest <eos> Standing tall, pretending not to be afraid <eos> Sunday, carry me, carry me down to the water <eos> And wash me clean, I'm still struggling <eos> Sunday, bury me under the weight of who you need me to be <eos> Can't you see I'm struggling? <eos> Sunday, come around, lift me up again <eos> Never too proud for a helping hand <eos> I've been feeling down <eos> Can you heal me now? <eos> Sunday, come around, lift me up again <eos> Never too proud for a helping hand <eos> I've been feeling down <eos> Can you heal me now? <eos> Sunday, carry me, carry me down to the water <eos> And wash me clean, I'm still struggling <eos> Sunday, bury me under the weight of who you need me to be <eos> Can't you see I'm struggling? <eos> 
I can feel it in the future <eos> I can see it in the culture <eos> I see the moon as a sunrise <eos> See the stars with my morning eyes <eos> Like a bear in the forest <eos> Like the heat in the conscience <eos> I take a walk through the treeline <eos> Gettin' on with Father Time <eos> When do I begin?

You never act aloud the way you appear <eos> My every breath awakes alarms in your ears <eos> I'm not confused, it's just you're making me think <eos> Of all our conversations missing their link <eos> I wanna know all the dreams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I plan to take <eos> And I hope you won't care <eos> But all your makeup's running <eos> And I'm walking you home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> I see you more at night then you do the day <eos> I'm more concerned for what you'll leave if you stay <eos> I'm not confused, it's just I don't wanna talk <eos> It seems the key was not to peek through the locks <eos> So I wanna hear all the screams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I never take <eos> And I know you don't care <eos> But all those pretty people are still going home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> Like this, like this, like this <eos>

Maybe it's nice to be alone in the end <eos> You know I'm fine living so close to the edge <eos> Who needs a house when I've got all these friends? <eos> They say: "Are you gonna give up some day?" <eos> "Are you gonna grow up some day?" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Don't need a license when you've got no drive <eos> It feels so right taking the wrong advice <eos> They tell me one day that I'll pay the price <eos> They saying: "Maybe I'll go up in flames" <eos> "Maybe it'll blow up one day" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live my life, live my life <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos>

Somewhere off the PCH with some beaches <eos> Drinkin' hard lemonade (Aaahaaa!) <eos> I'm never hungover from under achieving <eos> I'm gettin' carried away <eos> (I got!) I know a place where anything goes <eos> Where the sea makes purple weeds grow <eos> Where the sun and the cars <eos> And the girls at the bars ride low <eos> (I got!)

Never hungover from under achieving <eos> I'm gettin' carried away <eos> Carried away (Away!) <eos> Carried away (Away!) <eos> Carried away (Away!) <eos> Carried away (Away!) <eos> Carried away (Away!) <eos> Carried away, carried away <eos> Crashing in a daydream <eos> Wave after wave <eos> Carried away, carried away <eos> Crashing in a daydream <eos> Wave after wave <eos> Somewhere off the PCH with some beaches <eos> Drinkin' hard lemonade (Aaahhaaa!) <eos> I'm never hungover from under achieving <eos> I'm gettin' carried away <eos> Carried away <eos> Somewhere off the PCH with some beaches <eos> Drinkin' hard lemonade (Carried away) <eos> I'm never hungover from under achieving <eos> I'm gettin' carried away <eos> Carried away <eos> Somewhere off the PCH with some beaches <eos> Drinkin' hard lemonade (Carried away) <eos> I'm never hungover from under achieving <eos> I'm gettin' carried away <eos> Carried away <eos> Carried away, carried away <eos> Crashing in a daydream <eos> Wave after wave <eos> Carried away, carried away <eos> Crashing in a daydream <eos> Wave after wave <eos>

Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand <eos> But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man <eos> These nights never seem to go to plan <eos> I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand? <eos> Oh, won't you stay with me? <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> This ain't love, it's clear to see <eos> But darling, stay with me <eos> Why am I so emotional? <eos> No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control <eos> And deep down I know this never works <eos> But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt <eos> Oh, won't you stay with me? <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> This ain't love, it's clear to see <eos> But darling, stay with me <eos> Oooh, oooh <eos> Oooh, oooh <eos> Oh, won't you stay with me? <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> This ain't love, it's clear to see <eos> But darling, stay with me <eos> Oh, won't you stay with me? <eos> 'Cause you're all I need <eos> This ain't love, it's clear to see <eos> But darling, stay with me <eos>

Going out tonight, changes into something red <eos> Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress <eos> Everything she never had, she's showing off <eos> Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair <eos> She's heading for something that she won't forget <eos> Having no regrets is all that she really wants <eos> We're only getting older, baby <eos> And I've been thinking about it lately <eos> Does it ever drive you crazy <eos> Just how fast the night changes? <eos> Everything that you've ever dreamed of <eos> Disappearing when you wake up <eos> But there's nothing to be afraid of <eos> Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you <eos> Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head <eos> He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette <eos> Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop <eos> Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin <eos> She's falling, doesn't even know it yet <eos> Having no regrets is all that she really wants <eos> We're only getting older, baby <eos> And I've been thinking about it lately <eos> Does it ever drive you crazy <eos> Just how fast the night changes? <eos> Everything that you've ever dreamed of <eos> Disappearing when you wake up <eos> But there's nothing to be afraid of <eos> Even when the night changes, it will never change me and you <eos> Going out tonight, changes into something red, her mother doesn't like that kind of dress <eos> Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost <eos> We're only getting older, baby <eos> And I've been thinking about it lately <eos> Does it ever drive you crazy <eos> Just how fast the night changes? <eos> Everything that you've ever dreamed of <eos> Disappearing when you wake up <eos> But there's nothing to be afraid of <eos> Even when the night changes <eos> It will never change, baby, it will never change, baby <eos> It will never change, me and you <eos> 
I met you in the dark <eos> You lit me up <eos> You made me feel as though <eos> I was enough <eos> We danced the night away <eos> We drank too much <eos> I held your hair back when <eos> You were throwing up <eos> Then you smiled over your shoulder <eos> For a minute, I was stone cold sober <eos> I pulled you closer to my chest <eos> And you asked me to stay over <eos> I said, I already told ya <eos> I think that you should get some rest <eos> I knew I loved you then <eos> But you'd never know <eos> 'Cause I played it cool <eos> When I was scared of letting go <eos> I knew I needed you <eos> But I never showed <eos> But I wanna stay with you <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed <eos> I'll bring you coffee <eos> With a kiss on your head <eos> And I'll take the kids to school <eos> Wave them goodbye <eos> And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night <eos> When you looked over your shoulder <eos> For a minute, I forget that I'm older <eos> I wanna dance with you right now, oh <eos> And you look as beautiful as ever <eos> And I swear that every day you'll get better <eos> You make me feel this way somehow <eos> I'm so in love with you <eos> And I hope you know <eos> Darling your love is more <eos> Than worth its weight in gold <eos> We've come so far my dear <eos> Look how we've grown <eos> And I wanna stay with you <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> I wanna live with you <eos> Even when we're ghosts <eos> 'Cause you were always there for me <eos> When I needed you most <eos> I'm gonna love you till <eos> My lungs give out <eos> I promise 'til death we part <eos> Like in our vows <eos> So I wrote this song for you <eos> Now everybody knows <eos> That it's just you and me <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Oh, just say you won't let go <eos> 
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> 
You must think that I'm stupid <eos> You must think that I'm a fool <eos> You must think that I'm new to this <eos> But I have seen this all before <eos> I'm never gonna let you close to me <eos> Even though you mean the most to me <eos> 'Cause every time I open up, it hurts <eos> So I'm never gonna get too close to you <eos> Even when I mean the most to you <eos> In case you go and leave me in the dirt <eos> But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry <eos> And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry <eos> And every time you walk out, the less I love you <eos> Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless <eos> I know you're thinkin' I'm cold <eos> I'm just protectin' my innocence <eos> I'm just protectin' my soul <eos> I'm never gonna let you close to me <eos> Even though you mean the most to me <eos> 'Cause every time I open up, it hurts <eos> So I'm never gonna get too close to you <eos> Even when I mean the most to you <eos> In case you go and leave me in the dirt <eos> But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry <eos> And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry <eos> And every time you walk out, the less l love you <eos> Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> No way that you'll see me cry <eos> (No way that you'll see me cry) <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> No <eos> No, no, no, no, no <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> No, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> (No way that you'll see me cry) <eos> Ahhh <eos> (I'm way too good at goodbyes) <eos> 'Cause every time you hurt me, the less that I cry <eos> And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry <eos> And every time you walk out, the less I love you <eos> Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true <eos> I'm way too good at goodbyes <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> 
I figured it out <eos> I figured it out from black and white <eos> Seconds and hours <eos> Maybe they had to take some time <eos> I know how it goes <eos> I know how it goes from wrong and right <eos> Silence and sound <eos> Did they ever hold each other tight like us? <eos> Did they ever fight like us? <eos> You and I, we don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end <eos> Nothing can come between you and I <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us <eos> No, nothing can come between you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> I figured it out <eos> Saw the mistakes of up and down <eos> Meet in the middle <eos> There's always room for common ground <eos> I see what it's like <eos> I see what it's like for day and night <eos> Never together <eos> 'Cause they see things in a different light like us <eos> They never tried like us <eos> You and I, we don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end <eos> Nothing can come between you and I <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us <eos> (Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us) <eos> 'Cause you and I <eos> We don't wanna be like them <eos> We can make it 'til the end (until the end) <eos> Nothing can come between you and I (Nothing can come between) <eos> Not even the Gods above <eos> Can separate the two of us (two of us) <eos> No, nothing can come between you and I <eos> You and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> We could make it if we try, you and I <eos> Oh, you and I <eos> 
Walking down 29th and park <eos> I saw you in another's arm <eos> Only a month we've been apart <eos> You look happier <eos> Saw you walk inside a bar <eos> He said something to make you laugh <eos> I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours <eos> Yeah, you look happier, you do <eos> Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody love you like I do <eos> Promise that I will not take it personal, baby <eos> If you're moving on with someone new <eos> 'Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <eos> And until then I'll smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> Sat in the corner of the room <eos> Everything's reminding me of you <eos> Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself <eos> You're happier, aren't you? <eos> Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody need you like I do <eos> I know that there's others that deserve you <eos> But my darling, I am still in love with you <eos> But I guess you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too <eos> I could try to smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> ‘Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> I knew one day you’d fall for someone new <eos> But if he breaks your heart like lovers do <eos> Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you <eos> 
To be young and in love in New York City <eos> To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me <eos> To be drunk and in love in New York City <eos> Midnight into morning coffee, burning through the hours talking <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I don't know what it is but I got that feeling <eos> Waking up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling <eos> If we lay, let the day just pass us by <eos> I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something <eos> Damn <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh <eos> Stay awhile, stay awhile <eos> Stay here with me <eos> Lay here with me, ooh <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Yes I do, yes I do, babe) <eos> I like me better when I'm with you (Oooh noo) <eos> I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause <eos> I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you <eos> (I like me, I like me) <eos> (Look who you made me, made me, oh noo) <eos> Better when <eos> I like me better when I'm with you <eos> 
I will leave my heart at the door <eos> I won't say a word <eos> They've all been said before, you know <eos> So why don't we just play pretend <eos> Like we're not scared of what is coming next <eos> Or scared of having nothing left? <eos> Look, don't get me wrong <eos> I know there is no tomorrow <eos> All I ask is <eos> If this is my last night with you <eos> Hold me like I'm more than just a friend <eos> Give me a memory I can use <eos> Take me by the hand while we do <eos> What lovers do <eos> It matters how this ends <eos> 'Cause what if I never love again? <eos> I don't need your honesty <eos> It's already in your eyes <eos> And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me <eos> No one knows me like you do <eos> And since you're the only one that mattered <eos> Tell me, who do I run to? <eos> Look, don't get me wrong <eos> I know there is no tomorrow <eos> All I ask is <eos> If this is my last night with you <eos> Hold me like I'm more than just a friend <eos> Give me a memory I can use <eos> Take me by the hand while we do <eos> What lovers do <eos> It matters how this ends <eos> 'Cause what if I never love again? <eos> Let this be our lesson in love <eos> Let this be the way we remember us <eos> I don't want to be cruel or vicious <eos> And I ain't asking for forgiveness <eos> All I ask is <eos> If this is my last night with you <eos> Hold me like I'm more than just a friend <eos> Give me a memory I can use <eos> Take me by the hand while we do <eos> What lovers do <eos> It matters how this ends <eos> 'Cause what if I never love again? <eos> 
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold <eos> Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows <eos> We were walking on moonlight, and you pulled me close <eos> Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone <eos> I woke up in tears, with you by my side <eos> A breath of relief, and I realized <eos> No, we're not promised tomorrow <eos> So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you <eos> I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted <eos> 'Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you) <eos> I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you <eos> In the blink of an eye, just a whisper of smoke <eos> You could lose everything, the truth is you never know <eos> So I'll kiss you longer, babe (Hey), any chance that I get <eos> I'll make the most of the minutes and love with no regret <eos> Let's take our time to say what we want (Say what we want) <eos> Use what we got before it's all gone (All gone) <eos> 'Cause no (No), we're not promised tomorrow <eos> So I'm gonna love you, like I'm gonna lose you (Lose you) <eos> I'm gonna hold you (Hey), like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing (Yeah), I won't take you for granted <eos> 'Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you), like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you) <eos> I'm gonna love you (Love you), like I'm gonna lose you <eos> Hey <eos> I'm gonna love you (Oh) <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you) <eos> I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted <eos> 'Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you, baby) <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you (Like I'm gonna lose you) <eos> I'm gonna love you (Oh), like I'm gonna lose you <eos> 
Heart beats fast <eos> Colors and promises <eos> How to be brave <eos> How can I love when I'm afraid to fall? <eos> But watching you stand alone <eos> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> Time stands still <eos> Beauty in all she is <eos> I will be brave <eos> I will not let anything take away <eos> What's standing in front of me <eos> Every breath <eos> Every hour has come to this <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> One step closer <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> 
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain <eos> I leave my heart open <eos> But it stays right here empty for days <eos> She told me in the morning <eos> She don't feel the same about us in her bones <eos> It seems to me that when I die <eos> These words will be written on my stone <eos> And I'll be gone, gone tonight <eos> The ground beneath my feet is open wide <eos> The way that I've been holding on too tight <eos> With nothing in between <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen (The story of, the story of) <eos> The story of my life <eos> I give her hope <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> Written on these walls are the colours that I can't change <eos> Leave my heart open <eos> But it stays right here in its cage <eos> I know that in the morning, now <eos> I'll see us in the light up on the hill <eos> Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still <eos> And I'll be gone, gone tonight <eos> The fire beneath my feet is burning bright <eos> The way that I've been holding on so tight <eos> With nothing in between <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> I give her hope <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> The story of my life (The story of, the story of) <eos> And I been waiting for this time to come around <eos> But, baby, running after you <eos> Is like chasing the clouds <eos> The story of my life <eos> I take her home <eos> I drive all night <eos> To keep her warm <eos> And time is frozen <eos> The story of my life <eos> I give her hope (Give her hope) <eos> I spend her love <eos> Until she's broke inside <eos> (Until she's broke inside) <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos> The story of my life <eos> 
I saw you looking brand new overnight <eos> And I caught you looking too, but you didn't look twice <eos> You look happy, oh, mmm <eos> You look happy, oh <eos> Flashing back to New York City <eos> Change your flight so you stay with me <eos> Remember thinking that I got this right <eos> And now I wish we never met <eos> 'Cause you're too hard to forget <eos> While I'm cleaning up your mess <eos> I know he's taking off your dress <eos> And I know that you don’t, but if I ask you if you love me <eos> I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me <eos> It's 3 AM and the moonlight's testing me (Ah) <eos> I know that you've been holding on to someone else <eos> And now I can't sleep (Ah) <eos> I ain't happy, oh <eos> I ain't too happy, oh <eos> Flashing back to New York City <eos> I was done, but you undid me <eos> Classic me to run when it feels right <eos> Now I wish we never met <eos> 'Cause you're too hard to forget <eos> While he's taking off my dress <eos> I know she's laying on your chest <eos> I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me <eos> I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me <eos> Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie <eos> Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie <eos> Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie <eos> Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie, lie (Yeah yeah) <eos> I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me <eos> I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me <eos> 
Everybody loves the things you do <eos> From the way you talk to the way you move <eos> Everybody here is watching you <eos> 'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true <eos> But if by chance you're here alone <eos> Can I have a moment before I go? <eos> 'Cause I've been by myself all night long <eos> Hoping you're someone I used to know <eos> You look like a movie <eos> You sound like a song <eos> My God, this reminds me <eos> Of when we were young <eos> Let me photograph you in this light <eos> In case it is the last time that we might <eos> Be exactly like we were before we realised <eos> We were sad of getting old, it made us restless <eos> It was just like a movie <eos> It was just like a song <eos> I was so scared to face my fears <eos> Nobody told me that you'd be here <eos> And I swear you'd moved overseas <eos> That's what you said when you left me <eos> You still look like a movie <eos> You still sound like a song <eos> My God, this reminds me <eos> Of when we were young <eos> Let me photograph you in this light <eos> In case it is the last time that we might <eos> Be exactly like we were before we realised <eos> We were sad of getting old, it made us restless <eos> It was just like a movie <eos> It was just like a song <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back <eos> To when you were there, to when you were there <eos> And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone <eos> 'Cause I still care, do you still care? <eos> It was just like a movie <eos> It was just like a song <eos> My God, this reminds me <eos> Of when we were young <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> (When we were young) <eos> Let me photograph you in this light <eos> In case it is the last time that we might <eos> Be exactly like we were before we realised <eos> We were sad of getting old, it made us restless <eos> Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless <eos> It was just like a movie <eos> It was just like a song <eos> When we were young <eos> 
Hey, you there <eos> Can we take it to the next level, baby, do you dare? <eos> Don't be scared <eos> 'Cause if you can say the words, I don't know why I should care <eos> 'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can <eos> But all you ever do is mess it up <eos> Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear <eos> That getting half of you just ain't enough <eos> I'm not gonna wait until you're done <eos> Pretending you don't need anyone <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm not gonna try 'til you decide <eos> You're ready to swallow all your pride <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> Hey, get out <eos> I've got nothin' left to give and you give me nothin' now <eos> Read my mouth <eos> If you ever want me back, then your walls need breakin' down <eos> 'Cause here I am, I'm givin' all I can <eos> But all you ever do is mess it up (All you ever do) <eos> Yeah, I'm right here, I'm tryin' to make it clear <eos> Getting half of you just ain't enough <eos> I'm not gonna wait until you're done <eos> Pretending you don't need anyone <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm not gonna try 'til you decide <eos> You're ready to swallow all your pride <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm standing here naked (Naked, naked) <eos> Oh, I wanna give you everything <eos> Wanna give you everything <eos> Oh, I, I wanna give you everything <eos> I wanna give you everything, oh <eos> I'm not gonna wait until you're gone <eos> 'Cause you pretend that you don't need anyone <eos> Can't you see that I'm naked (Naked, naked) <eos> Oh, see that I'm naked (Naked, naked) <eos> I'm not gonna try 'til you decide <eos> You're ready to swallow all your pride (Swallow your pride) <eos> I'm standing here naked (I'm standing here naked, naked, naked) <eos> I'm standing here naked (I'm standing, I'm standing here) <eos> I'm standing <eos> I'm standing here <eos> 
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me <eos> But bear this in mind: It was meant to be <eos> And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks <eos> And it all makes sense to me <eos> I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes <eos> When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs <eos> The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine <eos> But I'll love them endlessly <eos> I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth <eos> But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to <eos> I'm in love with you and all these little things <eos> You can't go to bed without a cup of tea <eos> And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep <eos> And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep <eos> Though it makes no sense to me <eos> I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape <eos> You never want to know how much you weigh <eos> You still have to squeeze into your jeans <eos> But you're perfect to me <eos> I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth <eos> But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to <eos> I'm in love with you and all these little things <eos> You never love yourself half as much as I love you <eos> And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to <eos> If I let you know, I'm here for you <eos> Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh <eos> And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth <eos> 'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to <eos> And I'm in love with you and all these little things <eos> I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth <eos> But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to <eos> I'm in love with you, and all your little things <eos> 
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there <eos> The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air <eos> It’s hard <eos> Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round <eos> It’s funny how things never change in this old town <eos> So far from the stars <eos> And I want to tell you everything <eos> The words I never got to say the first time around <eos> And I remember everything <eos> From when we were the children playing in this fairground <eos> Wish I was there with you now <eos> If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> I saw that you moved on with someone new <eos> In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you <eos> It’s so hard <eos> So hard <eos> And I want to tell you everything <eos> The words I never got to say the first time around <eos> And I remember everything <eos> From when we were the children playing in this fairground <eos> Wish I was there with you now <eos> Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> You still make me nervous when you walk in the room <eos> Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> And I know that it’s wrong <eos> That I can’t move on <eos> But there’s something about you <eos> If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> You still make me nervous when you walk in the room <eos> Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos>

In the summertime in 1861 <eos> And I was livin' near to Cairo town <eos> Only 20 years old when I stepped aboard the River Queen <eos> Well a man walked up in a shiny blue suit <eos> He said “Son you wanna play some cards?” <eos> It was the three-armed poker playin' river rat from New Orleans <eos> Well we sat down to play a little game of Black Jack <eos> And the folks how they gathered round <eos> And then he started to deal so fast my head commenced to spin <eos> In one hand he had a drink <eos> In one hand he had a smoke <eos> In one hand he had a royal flush <eos> Dirty three-armed poker playin' river rat from New Orleans <eos> La la la, La la la na <eos> La la la, La la la na <eos> You know I played ‘til I was broke <eos> Then I upped and walked away <eos> To have a talk with a gal I'd found <eos> For to get some sympathy for way the stranger treated me <eos> Well he walked up as bold as brass <eos> Put two arms around her waist <eos> And with the other hand he knocked me down <eos> I hate the three-armed poker playin' river rat from New Orleans <eos> La la la, La la la na <eos> And now morning has come to rolling River Queen <eos> Where the gamblin' man slept last night <eos> Folks say he fell overboard, and was washed out to sea <eos> And here I'm sitting here in a shiny blue suit <eos> Just a-grinnin' like a crazy fool <eos> Kinda wonderin' what to do with the other sleeve <eos> I hate that three-armed poker playin' river rat from New Orleans <eos> 
Less a lover, more a fighter <eos> But I'm tired of fighting to hold on <eos> Got too many scars to hide 'em <eos> So it's easier bein' on my own <eos> But you <eos> Shoot first, draw blood, before I know <eos> Yeah, you <eos> One shot, one touch, and I let go <eos> How did this happen? <eos> My walls were up and <eos> You moved without a sound <eos> Never imagined <eos> Like an assassin <eos> Yeah, one look took me down <eos> How did this happen? <eos> My walls were up and <eos> You moved without a sound <eos> Never imagined <eos> Like an assassin <eos> Yeah, one look took me down <eos> Down, down, down <eos> Down, down, down <eos> Yeah, one look took me down <eos> Down, down, down <eos> Down, down, down <eos> Yeah, one look took me <eos> Yeah, one look took me <eos> Yeah, one look took me <eos> 
Oh, Miles you changed this life for good <eos> It spins in ways I never thought it could <eos> Take all that we have grown and watch how it still blooms <eos> Though I’m far from you <eos> Oh, Miles, I wish you could have stayed <eos> Not only ‘cause I feel you’re hurt the same <eos> We push and pull and tried to stop the rain that left us soaked <eos> I miss you the most <eos> Oh, Miles, where did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Oh, Miles, I hope you find the girl <eos> That sends a shiver through your world <eos> To watch the moment the sun disappears behind thе hill <eos> Our little world so still <eos> Oh, Miles, wherе did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> 
Lost in this late night <eos> Got a long, long way to go <eos> I'm getting caught up <eos> Caught in the afterglow <eos> I keep on saying <eos> I'm saying to myself <eos> Don't you mess it up <eos> Oh, don't you mess it up again <eos> Don't you mess it up again <eos> All my friends keep asking 'bout you <eos> All your friends you know take me back to <eos> When we're sober <eos> When we're over tonight <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Still on my mind <eos> Will you need me in the cold light, cold light? <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Still on my mind <eos> My head's been turning <eos> And I don't know the moves to make <eos> Feel like I'm losing you <eos> But I don't wanna walk away <eos> I keep on saying <eos> I'm saying to myself <eos> Don't you mess it up <eos> Oh, don't you mess it up again <eos> Don't you mess it up again <eos> All my friеnds keep asking 'bout you <eos> All your friends you know, take me back to <eos> Whеn we're sober <eos> When we're over tonight <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> All my friends keep asking 'bout you <eos> All your friends you know, take me back to <eos> When we're sober <eos> When we're over tonight <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Still on my mind <eos> Will you need me in the cold light, cold light? <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Will you need me in the cold light? <eos> Still on my mind <eos> Are you gonna need me in the cold light? <eos>

Guarded <eos> I've been broken hearted <eos> I don't know when it started <eos> But you're showing me where it ends <eos> Exciting <eos> Yeah we got perfect timing <eos> But also kind of frightening <eos> I've already let you in <eos> And I'll follow wherever you go <eos> I'm just hoping that you don't <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> I'm all in <eos> All inside my head now <eos> I'm too afraid to look down <eos> 'cause I'm already falling for ya <eos> And I'm tired of taking it slow <eos> I just wanna let you know <eos> That I'll follow wherever you go <eos> I'm just hoping that you don't <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> 
I've been staring at a road <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> Too scared to follow up <eos> Even as the sunset descends on me <eos> I stay unmoved to change the view <eos> Of where it leads <eos> (Of where it leads) <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I feel the weight of what I need <eos> Come crash full force into me <eos> I see the stars, they light the sky <eos> And wonder where I fit into line <eos> Into line <eos> (Into line) <eos> I've been staring at a road (Into line) <eos> I've been staring at a road (Into line) <eos> I've been staring at a road (Into line) <eos> I've been staring at a road (Into line) <eos> (In the night) <eos> (In the night) <eos> I feel weak behind the night <eos> Cries I hear echo inside <eos> Even as the sunrise ascends on me <eos> I stay unmoved to change the view <eos> Of where this leads <eos> (Of where this leads) <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I keep getting closer, I only know <eos> I keep getting closer <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I keep getting closer, I only know <eos> I keep getting closer <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I keep getting closer, I only know <eos> I keep getting closer <eos> I've been staring at a road <eos> I keep getting closer, I only know <eos> I keep getting closer <eos> 
Maybe there's another place <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> Maybe there's another place <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me, for me <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me, for me <eos> Maybe there's another place for me <eos> Waiting in silence <eos> Persuaded you to come down <eos> Hiding on my own <eos> Fading when you're not around <eos> Maybe there's another place <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> Maybe there's another place <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me <eos> For me <eos> For me <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me, for me <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me, for me <eos> Maybe there's another time for me <eos> For me <eos> For me <eos> For me <eos> 
All the time I’ve had to grow <eos> From the valleys, left alone <eos> Said I had to let you go <eos> To read the writing on the wall <eos> Born and raised in <eos> California <eos> Skies were blue <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> Lost in every place I go <eos> But leaving footprints on the road <eos> Won’t be long before you know <eos> Nothing matters anymore <eos> Born and raisеd in <eos> California <eos> Skies were bluе <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> 
Want me <eos> Back <eos> Want me <eos> Want me <eos> Want me back <eos> Want me <eos> Want me <eos> Want me back <eos> Want me <eos> Want me <eos> 
I'd walk through fire <eos> To be closer to you <eos> I will never be whole <eos> 'Til I've carved it in stone <eos> And your heart, I hold <eos> Away from trouble <eos> That old heartache brings <eos> Oh, but none of it matters <eos> It's all gonna scatter <eos> And you're all I need <eos> The feeling I'm feeling <eos> I know it's a reason <eos> I want it the rest of our lives <eos> The feeling I'm feeling <eos> I know it's a reason <eos> I want it the rest of our lives <eos> We're the brightest light <eos> Stars will gather 'round <eos> Just to be with you <eos> Love's the loudest sound <eos> All the world's just noise <eos> We will drown it out <eos> When you're holding me <eos> Love will scream out loud <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Don't hold the reason <eos> When the feeling's this strong <eos> Every piece of me shattered <eos> While searching for matter <eos> All the webs are gone <eos> The feeling I'm feeling <eos> I know it's a reason <eos> I want it the rest of our lives <eos> The feeling I'm feeling <eos> I know it's a reason <eos> I want it the rest of our lives <eos> We're the brightest light <eos> Stars will gather 'round <eos> Just to be with you <eos> Love's the loudest sound <eos> All the world's just noise <eos> We will drown it out <eos> When you're holding me <eos> Love will scream out loud <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos> Woah (Stars will gather 'round) <eos> Woah (Love's the loudest sound) <eos> Woah (We will drown it out) <eos> Woah (Love will scream out loud) <eos> Woah <eos> Woah <eos>

Lyin' isn't better than silence <eos> Floatin', but I feel like I'm dyin' <eos> Still, no matter where I go <eos> At the end of every road <eos> You were good to me <eos> You were good to me, yeah <eos> I know it's easier to run <eos> After everything I've done <eos> You were good to me <eos> You were good to me <eos> Let me go <eos> But I don't wanna be alone (I feel it too) <eos> Let me go <eos> But I don't wanna be alone <eos> Leavin', isn't better than trying <eos> Growin', but I'm just growin' tired <eos> Now I'm worried for my soul <eos> And I'm still scared of growin' old <eos> You were good to me <eos> You were good to me, yeah <eos> And I'm so used to lettin' go <eos> But I don't wanna be alone <eos> You were good to me <eos> You were good to me, yeah, oh <eos> Let me go <eos> But I don't wanna be alone (I feel it too) <eos> Let me go <eos> But I don't wanna be alone <eos> God only knows (Let me go) <eos> Where our fears go (But I don't wanna be alone, I feel it too) <eos> Hearts I've broke (Let me go ) <eos> Now my tears flow (But I don't wanna be alone) <eos> You'll see (Let me go) <eos> That I'm sorry (But I don't wanna be alone) <eos> 'Cause you were good to me <eos> You were good to me <eos> And now I'm closin' every door <eos> 'Cause I'm sick of wantin' more <eos> You were good to me <eos> You were good to me, yeah <eos> Swear I'm different than before <eos> I won't hurt you anymore <eos> 'Cause you were good to me <eos> 
...only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> I can’t help it no <eos> About to unfold <eos> On the centerfold <eos> Oh yeah <eos> You’re a fairy tale <eos> Call you Ariel <eos> I know very well <eos> I am caught up <eos> Can’t get you out of my head like my favorite song <eos> Holding onto the ledge I won’t last too long <eos> Wise men say only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> They say I’m foolish <eos> Imma lose it <eos> Got the cool whip <eos> Oh no <eos> What to do <eos> Stuck like glue <eos> Turning blue turning blue <eos> Can’t get you out of my head like my favorite song <eos> Holding onto the ledge I won’t last too long <eos> Wise men say only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> 
I've been holding my breath <eos> I've  been counting to ten <eos> Over  something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm  alone in bed <eos> You  know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So  tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause  you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
I think I've caught onto ya <eos> Nobody had the heart to tell me <eos> And we mended what you made <eos> While we stare into the flames <eos> Reading the leaves of our teas (tea teas) <eos> I can't help but feel that thunder <eos> The sun came up <eos> But feeling darker <eos> You take me by surprises <eos> And I feel the saviour heightened <eos> Never to remind us <eos> I want your golden eyes <eos> I think I've caught onto ya <eos> Whisper in the dead of night <eos> Never knowing what we mean <eos> So you handle all hate <eos> With time and ties and faith <eos> Voicing your thoughts blearily <eos> You take me by surprise <eos> And I feel the saviour heightened <eos> Never to remind us <eos> I want your golden eyes <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> I don't want to be here <eos> I can't take it no more <eos> 
Oh, you never smoked this much before we met <eos> Light up, light up another cigarette <eos> I can tell you're drinking only to forget <eos> Don't know how I got you in such a mess <eos> How am I supposed to be your ray of light, your ray of light? <eos> I get dark sometimes, does it pass you by? <eos> I should be your ray of light, your ray of light <eos> But I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> Guess I forgot how to feel <eos> Just for a second, you're talking <eos> But I'm just pretending you have my attention <eos> I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> I made you think it was real <eos> If you think we're strong enough <eos> Come on and wake me up <eos> You never looked this tense before we met <eos> Back up, back when we were so innocent <eos> All this emotion that we're buried in <eos> Tied up, fired up on this adrenaline <eos> How am I supposed to be your ray of light, your ray of light? <eos> Not a cloud in sight, what a perfect night <eos> I should be your ray of light, your ray of light <eos> But that's not me <eos> And I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> Guess I forgot how to feel <eos> Just for a second, you're talking <eos> But I'm just pretending you have my attention <eos> I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> I made you think it was real <eos> If you think we're strong enough <eos> Come on and wake me up, wake me up <eos> Come on and wake me up, come on and wake me up <eos> If you think we're strong enough, wake me up <eos> And I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> Guess I forgot how to feel <eos> Just for a second, you're talking <eos> But I'm just pretending you have my attention <eos> I'm falling, falling asleep at the wheel <eos> I made you think it was real <eos> If you think we're strong enough <eos> Come on and wake me up, wake me up <eos> Wake me up, wake me up <eos> If you think we're strong enough <eos> Come on and wake me up, wake me up, wake me up <eos> 
I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> Not what you'd think <eos> And if I'm bein' honest <eos> It might've been a nightmare <eos> To anyone who might care <eos> Thought I could fly (Fly) <eos> So I stepped off the Golden, mm <eos> Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried) <eos> Nobody even noticed <eos> I saw them standing right there <eos> Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care) <eos> I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> But when I wake up, I see <eos> You with me <eos> And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you <eos> Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to <eos> If I could change the way that you see yourself <eos> You wouldn't wonder why you hear <eos> 'They don't deserve you'" <eos> I tried to scream <eos> But my head was underwater <eos> They called me weak <eos> Like I'm not just somebody's daughter <eos> Coulda been a nightmare <eos> But it felt like they were right there <eos> And it feels like yesterday was a year ago <eos> But I don't wanna let anybody know <eos> 'Cause everybody wants something from me now <eos> And I don't wanna let 'em down <eos> I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> But when I wake up, I see <eos> You with me <eos> And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you <eos> Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to <eos> If I could change the way that you see yourself <eos> You wouldn't wonder why you hear <eos> 'They don't deserve you'" <eos> If I knew it all then, would I do it again? <eos> Would I do it again? <eos> If they knew what they said would go straight to my head <eos> What would they say instead? <eos> If I knew it all then, would I do it again? <eos> Would I do it again? <eos> If they knew what they said would go straight to my head <eos> What would they say instead? <eos> 
Haven't seen you since the summer <eos> Strangers talk more than we do <eos> Don't know me, without each other <eos> It's taking time to get used to <eos> You didn't even call me <eos> When you came to town <eos> What's that all about? <eos> I know you're trying not to hurt me <eos> You don't wanna bring me down <eos> But why's it gotta be so <eos> Black or white this time? <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> Love or hate this time <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> Wish I knew how you were doing <eos> See your friends at coffee shops <eos> Work is fine, I'm keeping busy <eos> Till I break down in parking lots <eos> You didn't even call me when you came to town <eos> What's that all about? <eos> I know you're trying not to hurt me <eos> You don't wanna bring me down <eos> But why's it gotta be so <eos> Black or white this time? <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> Love or hate this time <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> How could you go from all into nothing? <eos> 
It isn't new anymore <eos> It isn't you anymore <eos> We meant it in the moment, but <eos> Your ice is all melted and time couldn't help it <eos> It's like I've been here before <eos> Now I'm standing on the other shore <eos> It's funny that you pulled me down <eos> 'Cause you would drown in the depths of what I feel now <eos> Don't water me down <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> Don't spin me around your finger <eos> 'Cause this isn't about you now <eos> I'm not the same anymore <eos> I'm not afraid anymore <eos> Not empty without you now <eos> Turns out that you were the train I was circling 'round <eos> It's not that way anymore <eos> You're not on the page anymore <eos> I had to lose my ground <eos> But I know how to hold it now <eos> Don't water me down <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> Don't spin me around your finger <eos> 'Cause this isn't about you now <eos> (It's not about you now) <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> And this isn't about you now <eos> Don't water me down <eos> I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> Don't water me down <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> Don't water me down <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> Don't water me down <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> And this isn't about you now <eos> (It's not about you now) <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> (It's not about you now) <eos> When I'm already flowing over <eos> I'm already flowing out <eos> And this isn't about you now <eos>

I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> I've been running from it <eos> Tired of running from it <eos> Scared of feeling something <eos> Now I'm stuck here tryna get up outta this hole <eos> I tried to be strong <eos> I tried to make it work but I've been feeling too numb <eos> Skies are beating on me <eos> Why'd you leave me lonely? <eos> Feeling Whitney, Stoney <eos> Now I'm stuck here wondering where I ever went wrong <eos> How could I be strong? <eos> I'm fighting for your love <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> I don't see light in your love anymore <eos> There ain't no reason to call in a fall <eos> I don't like feelings and feeling like running from something <eos> And feeling so out of control <eos> I know that the feelings are gone <eos> I'm spending too much time alone <eos> I'm hoping you pick up the phone <eos> And ring me when you wanna stay overnight <eos> My shoulder's right <eos> My baby's all that I want <eos> And I play them, all of my favourite songs <eos> That lady is my favourite one <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> Ain't never gonna let you go <eos> Got my heart NASCAR racing <eos> Shine ain't never fading <eos> He just left you hanging <eos> Fiending for your love <eos> All worth it for the waiting <eos> Give you what you need <eos> Take you where you want <eos> Can't feel it when we're all alone <eos> Know you're wanting something more <eos> My heart is like an open door <eos> Just ring me when you wanna go <eos> I'll wait till you're home <eos> Hold a place till you're coming home <eos> Show you where the garden grows <eos> Just ring me when you wanna go <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> 
Wake up, man, I hate the front door <eos> Tell myself, "Go out more" <eos> End up in the same bed, lonely <eos> Feels like every day is wasted <eos> Like I'm on a wait list <eos> For someone to really know me <eos> I don't know where you're from <eos> I don't care if it's real <eos> 'Cause I like the way you talk <eos> The way you feel <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> I've been driving with the breaks on <eos> Taking all the turns wrong <eos> But if it brought me here, I'm not mad <eos> Tеll me this don't happen often <eos> Got you ditching your friеnds <eos> You say that you never do that <eos> I don't know where you're from <eos> I don't care if it's real <eos> 'Cause I like the way you talk <eos> The way you feel <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> Automatic <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> Cinematic (And I) <eos> Gotta have it <eos> Shit, you feel like magic <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> God, I love the way you talk <eos> The way you feel, baby <eos> 
Do you ever think about leaving? <eos> Do you ever think about me and you? <eos> Running to the country <eos> Where we go nothing to prove <eos> Where we can grow old with new friends <eos> Lay low on the weekends <eos> Running to the country <eos> Where we go nothing to lose <eos> 'Cause I'm tired of the busy nights <eos> Fed up with the city lights <eos> Oh, I don't wanna spend my life in this place <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause evеn cowgirls get the blues <eos> Thеre's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I wanna see a scar from a dirt road <eos> I wanna feel the air cut through my coat <eos> Seven hundred acres <eos> So many new ways to see you (To see you) <eos> And all I see is a love that we sow <eos> I can see 'em grow as we grow <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause even cowgirls get the blues <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> Getting tired of the busy nights <eos> Getting tired of the city lights <eos> Yeah, I know I can spend the rest of my life here <eos> I just wanna run away to Montana <eos> Living at a slower pace with you <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> I could wipe your tears away if you're crying <eos> 'Cause even cowgirls get the blues <eos> There's nothing else that I would need if I had you <eos> In Montana <eos> In Montana <eos> 
Woke up in the same clothes I wore yesterday <eos> My head is pounding now, I lost my phone again <eos> I found a grey hair and I thought about <eos> When my dad was my age, he was married by now <eos> Sometimes I wonder how things would turn out <eos> If I stayed in school, never left my hometown <eos> I don't do the things I'm supposed to <eos> Overthinking, underfocused <eos> Emotional rollercoaster, keep it all on my shoulders <eos> Hoping no one will notice <eos> I'm no good at getting older <eos> Last year I almost threw in the towel <eos> I was tired of suits telling me what to write about <eos> Yeah, but then I remembered the girl from Rhode Island <eos> Who said that our music saved her life <eos> And I'm not a saint, but I still talk to Jesus <eos> I hope he knows that I really mean it <eos> I don't do the things I'm supposed to <eos> Overthinking, underfocused <eos> Emotional rollercoaster, keep it all on my shoulders <eos> Hoping no one will notice <eos> I'm no good at getting older <eos> I called my dad one night when I was a wreck <eos> He said at your age, I was a mess <eos> So don't let it all weigh down on your shoulders <eos> Things will work out the way they're supposed to <eos> It's just part of getting older <eos> 
It's wild and free, when you're falling from the top <eos> Fear of the gravity, elevation made me stop <eos> Sick of all these things I do, all these calls keep coming through <eos> I've been in the hills all day just tryna find some solitude <eos> It's in the backseat of my mind <eos> Consequences of a fast life <eos> What if I've had it though? <eos> What if I'm stressing out? <eos> What if I took your call and tell you I don't want it all? <eos> I just wanna go this time and take it slow <eos> So can we slow down? Drive up just so we can <eos> Run around, yeah, you'll see me on the weekends <eos> On and on, keep me quiet in my weakness <eos> Honest now, let's turn off and just resеt <eos> When I step inside, right in front of you <eos> On thе loveseat, in the living room <eos> It's in the backseat of my mind <eos> Yeah, it's the chaos in the nick of time <eos> Sick of all these things I do, all these calls keep coming through <eos> I've been in the hills all day just tryna find some solitude <eos> It's in the backseat of my mind <eos> Consequences of a fast life <eos> What if I've had it though? <eos> What if I'm stressing out? <eos> What if I took your call and tell you I don't want it all? <eos> I just wanna go this time and take it slow <eos> So can we slow down? Drive up just so we can <eos> Run around, yeah, you'll see me on the weekends <eos> On and on, keep me quiet in my weakness <eos> Honest now, let's turn off and just reset <eos> Can we slow down? Drive up just so we can <eos> Run around, yeah, you'll see me on the weekends <eos> On and on, keep me quiet in my weakness <eos> Honest now, let's turn off and just reset <eos> 
Day breaks and when I turn <eos> You're not on my pillow <eos> My head shakes and then the penny drops <eos> Still your t-shirt on my chair <eos> Pencilled hearts on paper <eos> I try not to think but I can't stop <eos> And doubt sets in like a storm <eos> I could feel it coming <eos> And words echo out yesterday <eos> Time pushed me to the edge <eos> The jump was my decision <eos> I've only got myself to blame <eos> 'Cause I have no right to love you <eos> When I chose to walk away <eos> I have no right to miss you <eos> When I didn't wanna stay <eos> And I have no right to need you <eos> When I knew what my heart was gonna lose <eos> I have no right to love you <eos> But I do, I still do <eos> Yeah, I still do <eos> Night falls, I'm wide awake <eos> Wishing I could call you <eos> I'm too used to hearing all about your day <eos> The cold creeps up next to me <eos> Now we don't share these covers <eos> But I've no license to complain <eos> 'Cause I have no right to love you <eos> When I chose to walk away <eos> I have no right to miss you <eos> When I didn't wanna stay <eos> And I have no right to need you <eos> When I knew what my heart was gonna lose <eos> I have no right to love you <eos> But I do, I still do <eos> You know I care, but I can't be there <eos> To make this unmade bed of roses <eos> And you deserve to be put first <eos> I had to let you go <eos> I have no right to love you <eos> When I chose to walk away <eos> I have no right to miss you <eos> When I didn't wanna stay <eos> And I have no right to need you <eos> When I knew what my heart was gonna lose <eos> To ask if you're okay <eos> When I left you so confused <eos> I have no right to love you <eos> I have no right, oh <eos> I have no right to love you <eos> But I still do <eos> Yeah, I still do, woah <eos> I still do <eos> 
Well, I guess I'm at the end again <eos> Back to breaking down on benches <eos> Guess I've grown to feel nothing <eos> And it seems nothing hurts the broken <eos> Out of everyone, I seem to be the one without <eos> Stopped waiting out for love, so shouldn't it be here by now? <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Long to feel loved, loved <eos> Maybe one to feel loved, loved <eos> I keep waiting for my lover (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> And I keep losing everyone again <eos> Maybe 'cause I haven't found myself <eos> Feels like I'm looking for nothing <eos> And nothing hurts more than not knowing <eos> Out of everyone, I seem to be the one without (Oh) <eos> Stopped waiting out for love, so shouldn't it be here by now? <eos> (By now) <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Long to feel loved, loved <eos> Maybe one to feel loved, loved <eos> I keep waiting for my lover (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> Maybe one day when I am older <eos> I might understand why love <eos> Just doesn't happen to everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it (To feel loved, loved) <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> Everyone who wants it <eos> One day I might have it <eos> 'Round the corner <eos> I keep waiting for my lover <eos> Maybe when I'm older <eos> 
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit <eos> Been saying "yes" instead of "no" <eos> I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though <eos> I hit the ground running each night <eos> I hit the Sunday matinée <eos> You know the greatest films of all time were never made <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And if you wanted me, you really should've showed <eos> And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow <eos> And it's alright now <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> I have this dream you're doing cool shit <eos> Having adventures on your own <eos> You meet some woman on the internet and take her home <eos> We never painted by the numbers, baby <eos> But we were making it count <eos> You know the greatest loves of all time are over now <eos> I guess you never know, never know <eos> And it's another day waking up alone <eos> But we were something, don't you think so? <eos> Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool <eos> And if my wishes came true <eos> It would've been you <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For never leaving well enough alone <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you <eos> If one thing had been different <eos> Would everything be different today? <eos> We were something, don't you think so? <eos> Rosé flowing with your chosen family <eos> And it would've been sweet <eos> If it could've been me <eos> In my defense, I have none <eos> For digging up the grave another time <eos> But it would've been fun <eos> If you would've been the one <eos> (Ooh) <eos> 
Sometimes your life feels like a broken rollercoaster <eos> A thousand useless moving parts <eos> Sometimes you spend your nights <eos> Too scared of getting closer <eos> Hiding out in the back seat of your car <eos> You tell yourself it's raining <eos> The clouds are in your head <eos> You tell yourself it's better <eos> To jump before you fall again <eos> Before you lose it all again <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't lеt it bring you to your knees <eos> Look up <eos> Mondays aren't always bright <eos> Some days, you lose thе fight <eos> But life can be beautiful if you let it be <eos> Tomorrow keeps taunting you <eos> With all kinds of mystery <eos> It's a blank page for your poetry <eos> If you let it be <eos> So don't tell yourself it's raining <eos> The clouds are in your head <eos> You tell yourself it's better <eos> To jump before you fall again <eos> Before you lose it all again <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, yeah <eos> Look up <eos> Look up <eos> Hold on <eos> Look up <eos> Sometimes your life feels like a broken rollercoaster <eos> A thousand useless moving parts <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, yeah <eos> Look up <eos> Trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Look up <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, look up <eos> 
Weeks go so slow <eos> We haven't spoken one word <eos> Been an endless summer <eos> I go out and get home <eos> When neighbours' leaving for work <eos> I don't mind them judging <eos> I got nowhere to go <eos> Call everyone I know 'cause I go off when I'm alone <eos> Just get me drunk and hold me in the sun <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> Spending money <eos> On things I know I don't need <eos> Cut my hair to change me <eos> I'm smoking again <eos> Know how much you'd hate it <eos> But you ain't here to tell me <eos> I learned to live alone <eos> My home is not a home <eos> No, I don't feel it on my own <eos> And when I leave, I'm keepin' all lights on <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms, oh <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> I don't wanna know if you have moved on <eos> And you don't wanna know if I have met somebody new <eos> It's not as if I wanna run right back to you <eos> I just want time to pass so I'll get over you <eos> They say heartbreak always hurts the worst the first time <eos> You feel you're gonna die, you're blind, it's hard to see <eos> That in time, you will find that you've moved on <eos> Then you'll risk it all to feel it all like the first time <eos> In a stranger's arms, oh <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Oh, I'll get over you <eos> Oh, I'll get over you <eos> In a stranger's arms <eos> 
I knew I’d have a bad time shaking you <eos> On the form, I’m naming who? <eos> With the crack sound of my tooth <eos> Coming loose <eos> It was all so complicated <eos> I didn’t mean to say it out loud <eos> Anyway then, I think I should go <eos> Exaggerate it <eos> All my heart is breaking <eos> I can’t overstate it <eos> How should I be feeling? <eos> So run the red out <eos> The ceiling is all coming down <eos> And I feel I should care but I don’t <eos> Mean to (So run the red out) <eos> Be rude (It’s all coming down) <eos> Now I feel like I’m finally me <eos> I know, I could’ve said I was feeling low <eos> But I’m here just to hold your coat <eos> I’ve been thinking I could stay at home <eos> It was all so complicated <eos> I didn’t mean to say it out loud <eos> Anyway then, I think I should go <eos> Exaggerate it <eos> All my heart is breaking <eos> I can’t overstate it <eos> How should I be feeling? <eos> So run the red out <eos> The ceiling is all coming down <eos> And I feel I should care but I don’t <eos> Mean to (So run the red out) <eos> Be rude (It’s all coming down) <eos> Now I feel like I’m finally me <eos> 
Mmm, mmm-mmm <eos> Slowly, why's the morning come so slowly <eos> When I got no one to hold me through the dark? <eos> Patient, they tell me that love is patient <eos> But it never wants to wait on my drunk heart <eos> So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love <eos> And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah <eos> Dear August, tell me that there's light <eos> At the end of all this starless night <eos> Dear August, please don't let me fall <eos> 'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore <eos> Fading, now the summer heat is fading <eos> I spend every evening praying for the dawn <eos> Save me, looking for someone to save me <eos> Give me everything you gave me, but your scorn <eos> So I'll take all of my, all of my, all of my wasted love <eos> And turn it into wine, into wine, into wine in my cup, woah <eos> Dear August, tell me that there's light <eos> At the end of all this starless night (Oh) <eos> Dear August, please don't let me fall <eos> 'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore, oh <eos> Oh, dear August (Oh) <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh, August <eos> Oh, no, no, no, dear August (Oh) <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh, August <eos> Ah <eos> Dear August, tell me that there's light <eos> At the end of all this starless night <eos> Dear August, please don't let me fall <eos> 'Cause I don't know where this road is headed anymore <eos> 
Hey, if we can solve any problem <eos> Then why do we lose so many tears? <eos> Oh, so you go again <eos> When the leading man appears <eos> Always the same thing <eos> Why can't you see <eos> We've got everything <eos> Going on and on and on? <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you, ooh <eos> Go on and go free <eos> Maybe you're too close to see <eos> I can feel your body move <eos> Doesn't mean that much to me <eos> I can't go on <eos> Saying the same thing <eos> Why can't you see <eos> That we've got everything? <eos> Do you even know, you know, know? <eos> Every time you go away, yeah <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you, ooh <eos> Every time you go, ooh <eos> Every time you go <eos> I can't go on <eos> Saying the same things <eos> Baby, can't you see? <eos> We've got everything <eos> Going on and on and on <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> I'm just looking at the pieces <eos> Every time you go away, be careful <eos> 'Cause you take a piece of me with you, yeah <eos> Every time you go away <eos> You take a piece of me with you <eos> Every time you go away <eos> Every time you go <eos> 
First cup of coffee after a long night <eos> First kiss after a bitter fight <eos> First time we see each other after too much time <eos> Something's gone, but we're still here and it's alright <eos> If this is a drug, keep me prescribed <eos> These are the side effects I want for life <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> First note you played on the midnight piano <eos> Our voices raised, holding the stars in place <eos> The first mile on the first road, where we let go <eos> First time we let our hearts race <eos> If this is a drug, keep me prescribed <eos> These are the side effects I want for life <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I know this moment is following the last one out <eos> Can't seem to hold it down <eos> I hope it stays around <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> You make me feel like Heaven needs to take its time <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos> I don't wanna move <eos>

I've been holding my breath <eos> I've been counting to 10 <eos> Over something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm alone in my bed <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on (Oh, I) <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that gives you <eos> All of the things I could not know <eos> 'Cause I keep fighting all the way <eos> I let you down so I could stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go <eos> And, baby, I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
I tiptoed in the room <eos> I know you got to have your rest <eos> She says, "Come lay beside me <eos> I been waitin' since you left" <eos> She's sweet to me <eos> Must be the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> The first time that I saw you <eos> Mmm, you took my breath away <eos> I might not get to Heaven <eos> But I walked with the angels that day <eos> She takes me by the hand <eos> I am the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> Some may have their riches <eos> Some may have their worldly things <eos> As long as I have you <eos> I'll treasure each and every day <eos> Just take me by the hand <eos> I am the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> 
I left in the pouring rain <eos> Saying I wouldn't be home again <eos> I get so caught between everything I feel <eos> I'm stubborn and I won't say sorry <eos> Write it out 'cause I know that you worry <eos> Wonder where I've been <eos> Got you questioning <eos> These tears are making me blind, I don't know why <eos> I start a forest fire and burn us down <eos> But you know at the end of the night, I'll come around <eos> Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed <eos> Maybe you made mistakes that got me on my knees <eos> And maybe we're a mess, but it works for me <eos> 'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me <eos> You keep to your side of the bed now <eos> Cold shoulder, turning your head <eos> Saying things that you don't mean, painful honesty <eos> You cut me right through the centre <eos> Throw my hands up, but I won't surrender <eos> When did words become all our weapons? Mmh <eos> These tears are making me blind, I don't know why <eos> We start a forest fire and burn us down <eos> But I know at the end of the night, you'll come around <eos> Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed <eos> Maybe you made mistakes, and that got me on my knees <eos> Maybe we're a mess, but it works for me <eos> 'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home <eos> Oh, love, hold me closer 'til we're old 'cause <eos> You know that in your arms I feel at <eos> Home, love, take me over, say you know now <eos> You know, you know, you know, you know <eos> Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed <eos> Maybe you made mistakes and it got me off my feet <eos> Maybe we're just a mess, but it works for me <eos> 'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me <eos> Come home, come home, come home <eos> 
They don't see you the way I do <eos> For them it's black and white <eos> For us it's technicolor <eos> Watching eyes on your every move <eos> They'll tell you who to be 'cause they don't know the other side <eos> The wild in your eyes <eos> That thing that only you can recognize <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow, mmm <eos> In your еyes I see evergreen <eos> And fiеlds of marigolds like they go on forever <eos> When we're there you and I are kings <eos> There's no one else to please so darling don't you ever go <eos> Thinking no one cares <eos> Just call my name <eos> And anytime you're scared <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow, mmm <eos> It's in your heart, in your mind <eos> It's every day, it's every night <eos> It's anywhere <eos> And everywhere you are <eos> Where you are <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow (Grow) <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos>

I left my heart in NY <eos> She had brown eyes and she had skin like gold <eos> How she loved me so <eos> I left my heart in NY <eos> I left my heart where she lay <eos> Her tears were falling oh wish i'd stayed <eos> I'd tell her well make it work <eos> I left my heart there with her <eos> I'll be right there if you go <eos> I'll come back <eos> I'm so sorry I left you alone <eos> I thought it just wouldn't work <eos> I realize I was wrong, so so wrong <eos> 'Cause I can't love you from far <eos> I left my heart where you are <eos> I left my heart in New York <eos> Wherever I go <eos> She'll always have my love and key to my soul <eos> I never feel like I'm home <eos> 'Till I get back home to her <eos> Ohhh <eos> I'll be right there if you go <eos> I'll come back <eos> I'm so sorry I left you alone <eos> I thought it just wouldn't work <eos> I realize I was wrong, so so wrong <eos> 'Cause I can't love you from far <eos> I left my heart where you are <eos> I left my heart in New York <eos> Oh where you are <eos> My god where you are Oh <eos> Where you are <eos> II'm so sorry I left you alone <eos> I thought it just wouldn't work <eos> I realize I was wrong, so so wrong <eos> 'Cause I can't love you from far <eos> I left my heart where you are <eos> I left my heart in New York <eos> 
I dropped my heart in auburn leaves <eos> And held the moon between my fingertip <eos> The night was stolen by the thieves <eos> But you wasn't in love, found a home in me <eos> The taste of silver rain is never gonna fill you up <eos> The way the candle sways <eos> Could we run with the wolves <eos> If this love isn't the one we choose? <eos> Are you ready to release me now <eos> And let the sky fall to the ground? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> You swept me up in evergreen <eos> A colour that I didn't know existed <eos> And I caught in the Holocene <eos> We're both following time instead of taking what we need <eos> The taste of silver rain is never gonna fill you up <eos> The way the candle sways <eos> Could we run with the wolves <eos> If this love isn't the one we choose? <eos> Are you ready to release me now <eos> And let the sky fall to the ground? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> Are we brave enough to change <eos> A love that's gonna make us break? <eos> Are we brave enough to change <eos> A heart that we couldn't breathe without? <eos> Could we run with the wolves <eos> If this love isn't the one we choose? <eos> Are you ready to release me now <eos> And let the sky fall to the ground? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> Could we run with the wolves? <eos> 
Love, I get so lost sometimes <eos> Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart <eos> When I want to run away, I drive off in my car <eos> But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are <eos> All my instincts, they return <eos> And the grand façade, so soon will burn <eos> And without a noise, and without my pride <eos> I reach out from the inside <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes I am complete <eos> In your eyes I see the doorway <eos> In your eyes to a thousand churches <eos> In your eyes the resolution <eos> In your eyes of all the fruitless searches <eos> In your eyes Oh, I see the light and the heat <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes <eos> Oh, I wanna be that complete <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes <eos> I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes <eos> In your eyes <eos> Love, I don't like to see so much pain <eos> So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away <eos> I get so tired working so hard for our survival <eos> I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive <eos> And all my instincts, they return <eos> And the grand façade, so soon will burn <eos> Without a noise, and without my pride <eos> I reach out from the inside <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes I am complete <eos> In your eyes I see the doorway <eos> In your eyes to a thousand churches <eos> In your eyes the resolution <eos> In your eyes of all the fruitless searches <eos> In your eyes Oh, I see the light and the heat <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes <eos> Oh, I wanna be that complete <eos> In your eyes, the light, the heat <eos> In your eyes <eos> I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes <eos> In your eyes <eos> Ada terang di matamu <eos> Ada kehangatan di matamu <eos> 
All these feet on fire <eos> Heavy are your eyes and the weight on your shoulders <eos> Chasing after time <eos> Something you can't touch but you know when it's over <eos> No control <eos> When you're running blind <eos> All we know <eos> Is what we left behind <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Try to let it go <eos> Step out on the cold, embracing the silence <eos> We were never told <eos> We can sing black songs when we should be flying <eos> No control <eos> When you're running blind <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Oooooh <eos> Cover me with moments <eos> Coloring the motions <eos> Oooooh <eos> Cover me with moments <eos> Coloring the motions <eos> Darling, you gotta keep breathing <eos> Lose yourself in the feeling <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> Take it back to that moment <eos> Before you start to feel broken <eos> Just be slow <eos> Just be slow <eos> 
Could you let me know? <eos> I could make some time if you wanted <eos> Couldn't find the phone <eos> I guess I got that summer, you said <eos> "I could be alright if you could re-write my life" <eos> And I said it won't faze me, but I reckon I may've been wrong <eos> I should let this go <eos> I could be your water instead, I'll put on my coat <eos> 'Cause I could hear you stall in the way you said <eos> "Is it alright to feel like I do, at all?" <eos> Got caught up in the skylight <eos> And the words just all came out wrong <eos> Just called to let you know <eos> This all is getting old <eos> And I could be your water instead <eos> Let me get my head aligned <eos> Help my life be worth your while <eos> Bend my arm, I won't be far at all <eos> 
I've been dreaming about you <eos> For a long time in my mind <eos> And I've been seeing your face <eos> In the light on the hill <eos> And I can't help thinking <eos> It's been a long time now <eos> And I've been wondering <eos> How you've been <eos> Well the last time we spoke <eos> There was a pain in your heart <eos> You said the rain just falls <eos> Every day on you <eos> And I couldn't help you anymore <eos> But I can tell you now <eos> You've gotta climb those <eos> Heavy tears <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Wash all your fеars away <eos> It's hard when you've got that pain <eos> Like a thorn in your sidе <eos> And it's calling out your name <eos> And it burns like a fire <eos> Well I can't take it away <eos> It's a shadow in the night <eos> But I can tell you <eos> To keep on climbing now <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Wash all your fears away <eos> Like a summer sun falls <eos> And the light just fades away <eos> There's a moon rising high <eos> To keep you on your way <eos> When you're lost in a dream <eos> When you're lost in your head <eos> That's just the place that you are <eos> And it's the road you're on <eos> There's a time to rest <eos> There's a time to move on <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Wash all your fears away <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Like a ladder to a rose, baby <eos> Climb on your tears <eos> Wash all your fears away <eos> 
I’ve been staring at the ceiling <eos> Trying to figure out <eos> How we end up here time and time again <eos> Swallowed up in doubt <eos> Brother, I quit dreaming <eos> Around the time that you did <eos> And traded hopes of leaving <eos> For the role where I’m best suited <eos> Do you hear me screaming <eos> Up into the sky <eos> “What’s the sense in grieving <eos> If nobody ever dies?” <eos> Oh, I feel the hours slipping <eos> While I stumble to the edge <eos> Losing faith in everything <eos> When I couldn’t make a dent <eos> ‘Cause I seem to forget <eos> When I get all worked up <eos> That you can find every colour <eos> If you look close enough <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh... <eos> There’s a certain bit of stillness <eos> That I only ever chase <eos> Like eyes before they open <eos> Or a storm before it breaks <eos> Running fingers into soil <eos> Releasing all its heat <eos> Well I can feel the humming <eos> Of the earth beneath my feet <eos> But still I seem to forget <eos> When I get all worked up <eos> That you can find every colour <eos> If you look close enough <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh... <eos> (If you’re looking close enough.) <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh... <eos> (If you’re looking close enough.) <eos> 
I'm not gonna make this easy, here comes the goodbye <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Take a bath in all the sorrow and enjoy the sight <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I'm takin' a picture of this in the back of my mind <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> I know when I really need to I can close my eyes <eos> 'Cause every time I go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> I remember the way you look at all the gates you've been assigned <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> Just let me know when you land, only then I'll be fine <eos> 'Cause every time you go I'm scared it's gonna be the last time <eos> You promise me each time you leave <eos> You haven't seen the last of me <eos> It's just I never have enough of you <eos> Feed me any line <eos> Just tell me this won't be the last time <eos> This won't be the last time <eos> One day we're both gonna look back, laugh at how much we cried <eos> 'Cause every time we left I thought that it would be the last time <eos> 
I hate you for what you did <eos> And I miss you like a little kid <eos> I faked it every time <eos> But that's alright <eos> I can hardly feel anything <eos> I hardly feel anything at all <eos> You gave me fifteen hundred <eos> To see your hypnotherapist <eos> I only went one time <eos> You let it slide <eos> Fell on hard times a year ago <eos> Was hoping you would let it go, and you did <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> Somebody roll the windows down <eos> There are no words in the English language <eos> I could scream to drown you out <eos> I'm on the outside looking through <eos> You're throwing rocks around your room <eos> And while you're bleeding on your back <eos> In the glass <eos> I'll be glad that I made it out <eos> And sorry that it all went down like it did <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> Somebody roll the windows down <eos> There are no words in the English language <eos> I could scream to drown you out <eos> Hey, why do you sing with an English accent? <eos> I guess it's too late to change it now <eos> You know I'm never gonna let you have it <eos> But I will try to drown you out <eos> You said when you met me, you were bored <eos> You said when you met me, you were bored <eos> And you, you were in a band when I was born <eos> I have emotional motion sickness <eos> I try to stay clean and live without <eos> And I want to know what would happen <eos> If I surrender to the sound <eos> Surrender to the sound <eos> 
I'm freakin' out on the interstate <eos> Rolling down the windows, baby, I can't hear a thing you say <eos> I'm walking back to my favorite place <eos> And I can feel them staring at me <eos> Baby, do you think I'm doing something wrong? <eos> And you got a lot on your mind <eos> And your heart, it looks just like mine <eos> There's no use in wasting your time anymore <eos> I'm sorry I haven't been myself <eos> And something's got me down <eos> What it is, I cannot tell <eos> I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned <eos> Fear is just a part of love <eos> And one thing I found <eos> Is love is what you deserve <eos> Driving home and call my father on the telephone <eos> I hope you know I missed you, man <eos> Let's put it all behind us if we can <eos> Never feeling like I'm all the way home (all the way home) <eos> Stones inside my raincoat pocket I gotta keep <eos> Oh, won't you hold them for me? <eos> And you got a lot on your mind <eos> And your heart, it looks just like mine <eos> There's no use in wasting your time anymore <eos> I'm sorry I haven't been myself <eos> And something's got me down <eos> What it is, I cannot tell <eos> I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned <eos> Fear is just a part of love <eos> And one thing I found <eos> Is love is what you deserve <eos> I'm sorry I haven't been myself <eos> And something's got me down <eos> What it is, I cannot tell <eos> I won't be terrified with anything I've earned <eos> Fear is just a part of love <eos> And one thing I found <eos> Is love is what you deserve <eos> 
Every second counts <eos> I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and <eos> All these little games <eos> You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah <eos> Every minute counts <eos> I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah <eos> Can you figure me out? <eos> Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch <eos> Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time <eos> I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine <eos> Can you see me using everything to hold back? <eos> I guess this could be worse <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Pour your glass of wine <eos> Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah) <eos> Cases under the bed <eos> Spill it open, let it rush to my head <eos> I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners <eos> Savor this with everything I have inside of me <eos> I'm not the type to run <eos> I know that we're having fun <eos> But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed <eos> Tell you how I felt <eos> Sugar coated melting in your mouth <eos> Pardon my emotions <eos> I should probably keep it all to myself <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time <eos> I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine <eos> Can you see me using everything to hold back? <eos> I guess this could be worse <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> 
Finding, what you had in mind <eos> And seizing, the moments and the tides <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> Finding, what you had in mind <eos> And seizing, the moments and the tides <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> I don't wanna wait <eos> For you to give in <eos> You to give in <eos> I don't want to <eos> 
Now tell me something <eos> Is there a point to this? <eos> Or are we living for the feeling <eos> When we look back <eos> On what we did and reminisce? <eos> 'Cause I’ve looked within and I've read <eos> But instead I keep focusing <eos> On just how thin I can get <eos> Now I'm looking for something else <eos> I found myself: I’m someone else <eos> I keep looking for something <eos> Even though I know that it's not there <eos> (Maybe you're the reason) <eos> Every time I try to figure it out <eos> You're the only thing I can think about <eos> (Maybe you're the reason) <eos> And I think I'm dying <eos> 'Cause this can't be living <eos> Should I be searching for <eos> Some kind of meaning? <eos> Apathy’s a funny feeling <eos> I turned my gaze to the ceiling <eos> Thanked a God I don’t believe in <eos> For the scene outside <eos> I tried my best at sleeping but <eos> My dreams were unappealing <eos> So I searched for people in the landscape <eos> Passers by <eos> I keep looking for something <eos> Even though I know that it's not there <eos> (Maybe you’re the reason) <eos> Every time I try to figure it out <eos> You're the only thing I can think about <eos> (Maybe you're the reason) <eos> I keep looking for something <eos> Even though I know that it's not there <eos> (Maybe you’re the reason) <eos> Every time I try to figure it out <eos> You're the only thing I can think about <eos> (Maybe you're the reason) <eos>

What do you keep from me in your silence? <eos> Why do you sleep in cigarette ashes? <eos> You’re still my baby livin’ in a cold, cold world <eos> You’re still my baby livin’ in a cold, cold- <eos> Where do you go when you close your eyes? And <eos> Who are you aching for when you dream? <eos> I could peel peaches for when you wake up <eos> (No rush) No rush, no rush, no <eos> What do you sing when nobody’s watchin'? <eos> Love, I could build a fire for your hands <eos> But if you don’t believe in a heaven <eos> Where will our angel rest? <eos> You must believe in something <eos> You must believe in something <eos> You must believe in something <eos> I could peel peaches for when you wake up <eos> I could peel peaches for <eos> Love, I could build a fire for you <eos> (You must believe in somethin') <eos> Love, I could build a fire for your hands <eos> (You must believe in fire) <eos> Love, I could build a fire for you <eos> (You must believe in somethin') <eos> Ah <eos> What do you keep from me in your silence? <eos> I know you’re warm but you’re still my baby <eos> In a cold, cold <eos> 
The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> I don't know that much about Kingston <eos> But I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain <eos> I think that tonight I'll leave my light on <eos> 'Cause I get lonely when it's out and I miss you right about now <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> He said baby, that's what he called me, I love you <eos> Every single word you say makes me feel some type of way <eos> It's the thought of you that slightly scares me <eos> But it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say <eos> The day that I met you I started dreaming <eos> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morning time <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> Baby tell me where you want to go <eos> Baby tell me what you want to know <eos> Give you everything I have and more <eos> 
Slept in your bed when I had no place to go <eos> This is a dream I don't plan on letting go <eos> I can't breathe, suffocating so close <eos> Just hope you remember, hope you remember <eos> That late night in winter <eos> You saw a winner when I felt like a loser <eos> Coffee for dinner kept me warm in the cold <eos> Made me stronger on my own, no <eos> Often, often, tryna see you often <eos> Call you when I'm off then, workin' 'til the morning <eos> Giving up so easy (Oh), I think about it often <eos> Don't think about it often, often, oh <eos> Workin' two jobs 'til I finally got a whip (Whip) <eos> Crossing state lines, hoping I could feel something <eos> I can't breathe, suffocating so close <eos> Just hope you remember, hope you remember <eos> That late night in winter <eos> You saw a winner when I felt like a loser <eos> Coffee for dinner kept me warm in the cold <eos> But I never was alone, no <eos> Often, often, tryna see you often <eos> Call you when I'm off then, workin' 'til the morning <eos> Giving up so easy (Oh), I think about it often <eos> Don't think about it often, often <eos> Often, often, tryna see you often (Oh, no, yeah) <eos> Call you when I'm off then, workin' 'til the morning <eos> Giving up so easy (Oh), I think about it often <eos> Don't think about it often, often, no <eos> (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> 
I saw you in a dream <eos> You had stayed the same <eos> You were beckoning me <eos> Said that I had changed <eos> Tried to keep my eyes closed <eos> I want you so bad <eos> Then I awoke and it was so sad <eos> Haven't talked to you in months <eos> And I thought that I might cry <eos> But I'm not that kind of guy <eos> I saw you in a dream <eos> You came to me <eos> You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision <eos> There was no reason, no explanation <eos> The perfect hallucination <eos> All good things come to an end <eos> But I thought that this might last <eos> But you came and left so fast <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> (It isn't the same but it is enough) <eos> I saw you in a dream <eos> Then it came to an end <eos> I wonder if you'll come and visit me again <eos> You're taking your time to reappear <eos> I'm starting to believe that when I call your name <eos> You just don't hear me anymore <eos> And I know that I shouldn't even try <eos> It's a waste of time <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> (It isn't the same but it is enough) <eos> And when I'm awake I can't switch off <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> It isn't the same but it is enough <eos> 
I see the sun when it shines and others will not only see <eos> And I've ignored all the times that you might've wanted something to do <eos> I've got my heart on backwards, I spend my only days with you <eos> I've got my dreams standing tall, I wonder if she has a clue <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> I'll see the stars in the morning in the clouds when the sun goes down <eos> She's got me feeling each high, oh, no wonder she sees me frown <eos> I see the sun when it shines and others will not only see <eos> And I've ignored all the times that you might've wanted something to do <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what you're thinking about <eos> Sometimes I wanna know what it's all about <eos> 
Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I saw you at the band stand looking pretty slammed <eos> Did you see me feeding all my drinks to Cam? <eos> Probably not I guess, you were quite the mess <eos> And that girl who tagged along there with you <eos> I never caught her name but she seemed fucked up too <eos> From where I sat she looked to be having fun <eos> Keeping up with you, just like I used to <eos> Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I'm sorry to have ditched out but I was pretty high <eos> Heard from Leslie that on his stumble home <eos> Nat was puking up all that beer she'd drunk <eos> Though we didn't talk much how'd your evening go <eos> You barely spoke a word to me besides that slurred hello <eos> But I happened to see without even tryin' <eos> How she laughed with you, just like I used to <eos> Hey there bud, how'd it go last night? <eos> I woke up to a pair of shoes I've not seen next to mine <eos> Did you whisper as you crept in through the door <eos> How you'd never done much like this before? <eos> I was thinking back just the other day <eos> Remember when we used to sneak out late to go and blaze <eos> Seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do <eos> But now she's knowing you, just like I used to <eos> 
Hello <eos> There's a place <eos> I've been going <eos> There's a place I've been going <eos> Now I'm clean <eos> It would seem <eos> Let's go somewhere I'll be seen <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> I seen Greg and he was like <eos> "I seen your friends at the birthday party <eos> They were kinda fucked up before it even started <eos> They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show <eos> They didn't know about all the weird stuff <eos> So they just left it" (So they just left it) <eos> I was wasted (I was wasted) <eos> And cold <eos> And minding my business <eos> And I seen the girls and they were all like <eos> "Do you wanna come and get fucked up?" <eos> Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing <eos> "No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid <eos> It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it" <eos> "This ain't going well" <eos> I thought that I was stuck in Hell <eos> In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel <eos> About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well <eos> You pulled away when I went in for the kiss <eos> No, it wasn't a diss <eos> You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss <eos> After four years, don't you think I'm over all this? <eos> "That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room <eos> He's gotta share for a bit" <eos> You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby <eos> To get things that they don't have <eos> Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya? <eos> You know that I could sue ya if we're married <eos> And you fuck up again <eos> Impress myself with stealth and bad health <eos> And my wealth and progressive causes <eos> Then drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha <eos> Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it <eos> Look, the fucking state of it <eos> I came pretty late to it <eos> We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture <eos> All your friends <eos> In one place <eos> Oh, we're a scene <eos> Whatever that means <eos> I depend <eos> On my friends <eos> To stay clean <eos> As sad as it seems <eos> As sad as it seems (Alright) <eos> As sad as it seems (Come on) <eos> 
Our hearts are free <eos> So tell me what's wrong with the feeling <eos> I'm a flower, you're the bee <eos> It's much older than you and me <eos> I'm in love, I'm alive <eos> I belong to the stars and sky <eos> Let's forget who we are for one night <eos> We're not animals, baby <eos> It's the people who lie (to themselves) <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> Ooh, don't leave me waiting <eos> I've got real love maybe <eos> Wait until you taste me <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> There's a world inside me <eos> Got the key, just use it <eos> Just if for a minute (and gone) <eos> Our hearts are free <eos> So tell me what's wrong with the feeling <eos> I'm a flower, you're the bee <eos> It's much older than you and me <eos> I'm in love, I'm alive <eos> I belong to the stars and sky <eos> Let's forget who we are for one night <eos> We're not animals, baby <eos> It's the people who lie (to themselves) <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> Ooh, don't leave me waiting <eos> I've got real love maybe <eos> Wait until you taste me <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> There's a world inside me <eos> Got the key, just use it <eos> Just if for a minute (and gone) <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> Ooh, don't leave me waiting <eos> I've got real love maybe <eos> Wait until you taste me <eos> I want real love, baby <eos> There's a world inside me <eos> Got the key, just use it <eos> Just if for a minute (and gone) <eos> Our hearts are free <eos> (I want real love, baby) <eos> (Ooh, don't leave me waiting) <eos> So tell me what's wrong with the feeling <eos> (I've got real love maybe) <eos> (Wait until you taste me) <eos> I'm a flower, you're the bee <eos> (I want real love, baby) <eos> (There's a world inside me) <eos> It's much older than you and me <eos> (Got the key, just use it) <eos> (Just if for a minute and gone) <eos> I'm in love, I'm alive <eos> (I want real love, baby) <eos> (Ooh, don't leave me waiting) <eos> I belong to the stars and sky <eos> (I've got real love maybe) <eos> (Wait until you taste me) <eos> Let's forget who we are for one night <eos> (I want real love, baby) <eos> (There's a world inside me) <eos> We're not animals, baby <eos> (Got the key, just use it) <eos> (Just if for a minute and gone) <eos> It's the people who lie (to themselves) <eos> 
Cold <eos> Cold, as I already know you won't be there <eos> If I had seen that it wasn’t a dream <eos> Could you be here? <eos> Baby, I'm blue, don't tell me the truth <eos> Tell me it’s alright <eos> Taking it slow <eos> Try not to call, try not to care <eos> I'm taking it slow <eos> Try not to fall, try not to care <eos> Don't look back <eos> You've had enough of all my love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We're moving on now <eos> And ain't it sad? <eos> Giving up now, giving up all our love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We’re moving on now, somehow <eos> Deep <eos> Deep underwater, I breathe, let me soak <eos> Choosing the shades of the love that we made <eos> Of the love that we broke <eos> Baby was blue <eos> But I think that we knew it was gonna be alright <eos> Now that you’re near, I feel you still here <eos> Oh, what a shame <eos> Don't look back <eos> You’ve had enough of all my love <eos> I guess it's just too bad <eos> We're moving on now <eos> Ain't it sad? <eos> Giving up now, giving up all our love <eos> I guess it’s just too bad <eos> We're moving on now, somehow <eos> Typical that you called, oh hell <eos> Not my fault, and you know too well <eos> Difficult at the best of times <eos> Every morning, a new warning sign <eos> Typical that you called, oh hell (Ain't it sad) <eos> Not my fault, and you know too well (Giving up now, giving up all our love) <eos> Difficult at the best of times (I guess it's just too bad) <eos> Every morning, a new warning sign (We're moving on now, somehow) <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> But to claim and to claim <eos> To say and to say <eos> That nothing wears you out <eos> That's too sad, that's too sad <eos> What we had was too bad <eos> And it's gonna weigh you down <eos> 
Alright, should I go? <eos> Yeah, go ahead <eos> Was it something I said? <eos> Oh fuck <eos> Guess it's time for sadboy kiss and tell <eos> You ruined my life but I wish you well <eos> I lied about that second part, oh well <eos> Yeah, quit leaving me voicemails about your pain <eos> Shouldn't have to listen to the shit you say <eos> Why'd you even bring it up in the first place? <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you call me back at 3 AM <eos> Just to tell me your defense <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you wanna go and bitch to your friends <eos> Was it something that I said <eos> Lately I fear there's no end in sight <eos> 7-Eleven runs after midnight <eos> I know you're never there but you might <eos> Maybe if I try I could sleep it off <eos> I see you when I sleep, so I don't sleep at all <eos> Slowly all my thoughts start singing my favorite song <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you call me back at 3 AM <eos> Just to tell me your defense <eos> Was it something I said <eos> That made you anxious, yeah, it made you upset <eos> Made you wanna go and bitch to your friends <eos> Was it something that I said <eos> 
The ferns are greedy <eos> They all want something from me <eos> These trees are dirty <eos> Want me to have a baby <eos> Her kids are lonely <eos> They all want something from me <eos> Their eyes are beady <eos> Their stares they pierce right through me <eos> But I don't have anything left to give <eos> I'm like an old bone <eos> In the back of the fridge <eos> And I could ask for what I want <eos> So you could tell me what you need <eos> But there's no use trying anymore <eos> Like an old bone <eos> In the back of the fridge <eos> And I've got no home <eos> If it's not with you <eos> Your friends are greedy <eos> They all want something from me <eos> These streets are dirty <eos> Want me to have a baby <eos> Her kids are lonely <eos> They all want something from me <eos> Their eyes are beady <eos> Their stares they pierce right through me <eos> But I don't have anything left to give <eos> I'm like an old bone <eos> In the back of the fridge <eos> And I could ask for what I want <eos> So you could tell me what you need <eos> But there's no use crying anymore <eos> I'm just an old bone <eos> In the back of the fridge <eos> And I've got no home <eos> If it's not with you <eos>

Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Who was I? <eos> Who were you when I loved you? <eos> Babe, it's you <eos> I don't think I know <eos> I was different but you were too <eos> Matching socks and old cartoons <eos> Wish those days never changed <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Oh, I want you <eos> Do you want me back? <eos> Oh, I need you <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> Who was I when you loved me? <eos> 
Ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Feel me <eos> Ah ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Mama warned you about the boys like me, we're said to break your heart <eos> Ain’t that true <eos> I wish you’d listened to your friends when they had told you break apart, yeah <eos> Hey, it’s never too late to make love <eos> But I don’t want to have to make up <eos> No, I don’t want to have to make up <eos> It’s never too late to make love <eos> But I don’t want to have to make up <eos> No, I don’t want to have to make up <eos> Ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Feel me <eos> Ah ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> I apologize, I fall in love with anything that walks my way (Hey, hey) <eos> But trust me, I felt something new the day that I first saw your face (Hey, yeah) <eos> Ten missed calls from you this week <eos> I told my mom that we don’t speak <eos> I don’t wanna feel, I just wanna freak <eos> I don’t wanna feel, I just wanna freak <eos> Ten missed calls from you this week <eos> I told my mom that we don’t speak <eos> I don’t wanna feel, I just wanna freak <eos> I don’t wanna feel, I just wanna freak <eos> Ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Feel me (Do you feel, do you girl, do you girl?) <eos> Ah ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> (Do you feel, do you girl, do you girl?) <eos> (Tell me do you feel me?) <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> (Tell me do you feel safe?) <eos> (Tell me, are you feeling safe?) <eos> Ah ooh, do you think about the way we used to feel? <eos> Oh, oh <eos>

Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> Cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Tip-toeing ‘round in space (out of control, out of control) <eos> Do the dash, do the race <eos> Throw the cash in their face <eos> On the moon but out of phase (out of control, out of control) <eos> City map, locate, Double back rotate <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Command V copy and paste (copy and paste, copy and paste) <eos> Command me, set the pace (set the pace) <eos> Wanna link for your chain ? <eos> Grass on ground, rough terrain <eos> You man lounge, I’m detained <eos> So profound and too mundane <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> There’s no way, no way <eos> Long way, long way, long way <eos> Yeaaaaaah <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too <eos> Ring ring ring on my phone <eos> Hot hot hot on my own, on my own <eos> Eclipse just some fresh to my breath (ey) <eos> Everybody knows I’m a mess (ey) <eos> Pressed for a breath, I confess (ey) <eos> Leave me dead <eos> I step with disruption, sometimes I stride with some pride or corruption <eos> Find myself at a junction, looking both ways man I’ve run out of options <eos> Seeing the figures, I choose to ignore them <eos> If them seems important it’s blown out of proportion <eos> Moving with caution, I’m closer to satellites that are in orbit <eos> Flown overseas I’m in-doors I’m exhausted <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> You’ve got money to make <eos> Tycho, don’t be afraid <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> ‘cause it’s never too late, too late, too late <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos> 
I'm sittin' in the railway station <eos> Got a ticket for my destination, mmm <eos> On a tour of one night stands <eos> My suitcase and guitar in hand <eos> And every stop is neatly planned <eos> For a poet and a one man band <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Everyday's an endless stream <eos> Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm <eos> And each town looks the same to me <eos> The movies and the factories <eos> And every stranger's face I see <eos> Reminds me that I long to be <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Tonight I'll sing my songs again <eos> I'll play the game and pretend, mmm <eos> But all my words come back to me <eos> In shades of mediocrity <eos> Like emptiness in harmony <eos> I need someone to comfort me <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Silently for me <eos> 
I pulled in to Nazareth <eos> Was feeling 'bout half past dead <eos> I just need some place <eos> Where I can lay my head <eos> "Hey, mister, can you tell me <eos> Where a man might find a bed?" <eos> He just grinned and shook my hand <eos> And "No" was all he said <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> I picked up my bag <eos> I went looking for a place to hide <eos> When I saw Carmen and the Devil <eos> Walking side by side <eos> I said "Hey Carmen, come on <eos> Let's go downtown?" <eos> And she said, "I gotta go <eos> But my friend can stick around" <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say <eos> It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day <eos> "Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?" <eos> He said, "Do me a favor, son, won't ya stay and keep Anna Lee company?" <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog <eos> He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog." <eos> I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man." <eos> He said, "That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can." <eos> And take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> Catch a Cannonball, now, to take me down the line <eos> My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time <eos> To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one <eos> Who sent me here with her regards for everyone <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> Take a load for free <eos> Take a load off Fanny <eos> And (and, and) you put the load right on me <eos> (You put the load right on me) <eos> 
Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone <eos> Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you <eos> I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song <eos> I just can't remember who to send it to <eos> I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Won't you look down upon me, Jesus <eos> You've got to help me make a stand <eos> You've just got to see me through another day <eos> My body's aching and my time is at hand <eos> And I won't make it any other way <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun <eos> Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around <eos> Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come <eos> Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now <eos> Thought I'd see you one more time again <eos> There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now <eos> Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now <eos> 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter <eos> Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces <eos> Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting <eos> Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> It's alright <eos> 
There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos> 
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside <eos> I'm not one of those who can easily hide <eos> I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did <eos> I'd buy a big house where we both could live <eos> If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no <eos> Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show <eos> I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do <eos> My gift is my song, and this one's for you <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss <eos> Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross <eos> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song <eos> It's for people like you that keep it turned on <eos> So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do <eos> You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue <eos> Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean <eos> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> 
'Twas in another lifetime <eos> One of toil and blood <eos> When blackness was a virtue <eos> The road was full of mud <eos> I came in from the wilderness <eos> A creature void of form <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> And if I pass this way again <eos> You can rest assured <eos> I'll always do my best for her <eos> On that I give my word <eos> In a world of steel-eyed death and men <eos> Who are fighting to be warm <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Not a word was spoke between us <eos> There was little risk involved <eos> Everything up to that point <eos> Had been left unresolved <eos> Try imagining a place <eos> Where it's always safe and warm <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> I was burned out from exhaustion <eos> Buried in the hail <eos> Poisoned in the bushes <eos> And blown out on the trail <eos> Hunted like a crocodile <eos> Ravaged in the corn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Suddenly I turned around <eos> And she was standing there <eos> With silver bracelets on her wrists <eos> And flowers in her hair <eos> She walked up to me so gracefully <eos> And took my crown of thorns <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Now there's a wall between us <eos> Something there's been lost <eos> I took too much for granted <eos> I got my signals crossed <eos> Just to think that it all began <eos> On an uneventful morn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Well the deputy walks on hard nails <eos> And the preacher rides a mount <eos> But nothing really matters much <eos> It's doom alone that counts <eos> And the one-eyed undertaker <eos> He blows a futile horn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm <eos> I've heard newborn babies wailing <eos> Like a mourning dove <eos> And old men with broken teeth <eos> Stranded without love <eos> Do I understand your question, then <eos> Is it hopeless and forlorn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> In a little hilltop village <eos> They gambled for my clothes <eos> I bargained for salvation <eos> And she gave me a lethal dose <eos> I offered up my innocence <eos> And I got repaid with scorn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Well, I'm living in a foreign country <eos> But I'm bound to cross the line <eos> Beauty walks a razor's edge <eos> Someday I'll make it mine <eos> If I could only turn back the clock <eos> To when God and her were born <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> 
Me and Magdalena <eos> We're driving south through Monterey <eos> As the sun is slowly sinking <eos> Into a distant ocean wave <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Tell me Magdalena <eos> What do you see in the depths of your night? <eos> Do you see a long lost father? <eos> Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child? <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Me and Magdalena <eos> Always leaving early and sleeping late <eos> Secluded in the canyon <eos> Lost within a turn of fate <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> 
I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul <eos> Where I’ll end up, well, I think only God really knows <eos> I’ve sat upon the settin' sun <eos> But never, never, never, never <eos> I never wanted water once <eos> No, never, never, never <eos> I listen to my words, but they fall far below <eos> I let my music take me where my heart wants to go <eos> I've swam upon the devil’s lake <eos> But never, never, never, never <eos> I’ll never make the same mistake <eos> No, never, never, never <eos> 
She would never say where she came from <eos> Yesterday don't matter if it's gone <eos> While the sun is bright <eos> Or in the darkest night <eos> No one knows <eos> She comes and goes <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> Don't question why she needs to be so free <eos> She'll tell you it's the only way to be <eos> She just can't be chained <eos> To a life where nothing's gained <eos> And nothing's lost <eos> At such a cost <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> "There's no time to lose," I heard her say <eos> "Catch your dreams before they slip away <eos> Dying all the time <eos> Lose your dreams and you <eos> Will lose your mind <eos> Ain't life unkind?" <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> Goodbye Ruby Tuesday <eos> Who could hang a name on you? <eos> When you change with every new day <eos> Still I'm going to miss you <eos> 
She can kill with a smile <eos> She can wound with her eyes <eos> And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies <eos> And she only reveals <eos> What she wants you to see <eos> She hides like a child <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> She can lead you to love <eos> She can take you or leave you <eos> She can ask for the truth <eos> But she'll never believe you <eos> And she'll take what you give her <eos> As long as it's free <eos> Yeah, she steals like a thief <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> And she'll promise you more <eos> Than the Garden of Eden <eos> Then she'll carelessly cut you <eos> And laugh while you're bleedin' <eos> But she'll bring out the best <eos> And the worst you can be <eos> Blame it all on yourself <eos> Cause she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mmm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> She is frequently kind <eos> And she's suddenly cruel <eos> She can do as she pleases <eos> She's nobody's fool <eos> But she can't be convicted <eos> She's earned her degree <eos> And the most she will do <eos> Is throw shadows at you <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mm, mmm mm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm <eos> 
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> It don't matter, anyhow <eos> An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> If you don't know by now <eos> When your rooster crows at the break of dawn <eos> Look out your window and I'll be gone <eos> You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on <eos> Don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> That light I never knowed <eos> An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> I'm on the dark side of the road <eos> Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say <eos> To try and make me change my mind and stay <eos> We never did too much talkin' anyway <eos> So don't think twice, it's all right <eos> I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe <eos> Where I'm bound, I can't tell <eos> But goodbye's too good a word, gal <eos> So I'll just say fare thee well <eos> I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind <eos> You could have done better but I don't mind <eos> You just kinda wasted my precious time <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> Like you never did before <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> I can't hear you any more <eos> I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road <eos> I once loved a woman, a child I'm told <eos> I give her my heart but she wanted my soul <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos> 
If you’re travelin' in the north country fair <eos> Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline <eos> Remember me to one who lives there <eos> For she once was a true love of mine <eos> If you go when the snowflakes storm <eos> When the rivers freeze and summer ends <eos> Please see if she has a coat so warm <eos> To keep her from the howling winds <eos> Please see if her hair hangs long <eos> If it rolls and flows all down her breast <eos> Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long <eos> For that’s the way I remember her best <eos> I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all <eos> Many times I’ve often prayed <eos> In the darkness of my night <eos> In the brightness of my day <eos> So if you’re travelin' the north country fair <eos> Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline <eos> Remember me to one who lives there <eos> For she once was a true love of mine <eos> 
Una pequeсa lluvia cayу <eos> Sobre nuestro pequeсo amor <eos> Y gota a gota el dнa se perdiу <eos> Indefenso ante la oscuridad <eos> Una pequeсa lluvia y yo <eos> Desnuda bajo el agua estoy <eos> Ante las lбgrimas, ante el adiуs <eos> Indefensa frente al frнo y la tormenta <eos> Frente al sueсo del amor <eos> Como gota en movimiento, contra el viento <eos> En silencio, te he de olvidar <eos> Lloviу <eos> Sobre mis besos <eos> Lloviу <eos> Y el cielo me regalу <eos> Lluvia y silencio <eos> Lloviу, lloviу <eos> Pequeсas huellas de tu amor <eos> Que roto en mil pedazos cae <eos> Como la lluvia lo hace sobre el mar; <eos> Se confunden, se entregan y se unen <eos> No queda de ella mбs <eos> Que el recuerdo de un momento <eos> Y en silencio, bajo la luvia <eos> Te he de olvidar <eos> 
Charlie moonbeam: <eos> I was born with the gift <eos> Of impeccable pitch <eos> But the words that I pick <eos> Seem only to itch me <eos> The wrong way, it’s always a terrible game <eos> So, hey, would you be my muse? <eos> Whenever I try <eos> To be quick with my tongue <eos> It’s like a disease <eos> My brain just goes numb <eos> I just need someone who knows what to say <eos> So, hey, would you be my muse? <eos> This morning I woke <eos> With you by my side <eos> And somehow I spoke <eos> And to my surprise <eos> I asked for yer hand and I asked you to stay <eos> So, hey, would you be my muse? <eos> You’ve lifted the curse <eos> My ideas now flow free <eos> And I know it may hurt <eos> But that’s all that I needed <eos> Baby, yer crazy, i’ll be on my way <eos> But, hey, at least you were my muse… <eos> Big nick: <eos> So it goes.. and so it goes.. <eos> When fire burns <eos> Spirits are present.. listening <eos> And we can only listen to them - <eos> To see them.. <eos> Feel them.. <eos> To experience life <eos> To free the chains of ancestral manipulation <eos> Misinformation <eos> Of what lies beneath <eos> Beyond lies <eos> Lie <eos> In <eos> Belief <eos> So believe in the liar not his lies <eos> Love equals belief <eos> Love equals belief <eos> Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love <eos> Love <eos> Sir jove: <eos> Whysowhite? <eos> Whysoblue? <eos> Whysome? <eos> Whysoyou? <eos> Why the Lovers undercover looking for the colored brother to tell ya that you running from ya motha fucking other/ <eos> I didn't meant to bring the guns up/ <eos> Out on you ones up/ <eos> When ya done crunching ya numbers/ <eos> I got you with the suns up/ <eos> Segregations cause the funds up/ <eos> Ninja turtle cowabunga/ <eos> Pure imagination <eos> Willy wonka <eos> Top hat sucka/ <eos> I say this all with Love/ <eos> Because you know you was <eos> Did rainbows mess you up/ <eos> Well, color's relative/ <eos> Cause you's my relativity <eos> E equals mc <eos> Naw, my name jove <eos> Please check ya knows bleed <eos> K-now <eos> Ha ha <eos> Did you see? <eos> Not me <eos> See 3D <eos> In the middle of the beat <eos> Cuz I'm so rehe(art)ed <eos> We gon restart it/ <eos> Whysowhite calling the stars in those barses/ <eos> And they calling this one the martian/ <eos> I knew marvin/ <eos> Ask him what’s going on/ <eos> We all tryna be one/ <eos> Tryna be human/ <eos> In america/ <eos> Corporatizing all my loves/ <eos> Oh god! <eos> The last one got the gun <eos> Goons and lennons <eos> Whiles martin's on the run <eos> Malcom's is muslim <eos> Marcus african/ <eos> I'm going back to the future <eos> Check my sun <eos> Well when my verse is done <eos> Universing on this one <eos> You new like a virgin to this young tongue <eos> Lizzie izzie really can’t make em dumb <eos> When the colors of the love is the rays of everyone <eos> And funk! <eos> 
First Field Mob break up, now every day I wake up <eos> Feel the pressure coming down on me <eos> Know I wrote a thousand rhymes, somethin' like a thousand times <eos> I promise I got it, just put it all on Steve <eos> We ratchet and righteous, no, I ain’t forgot it <eos> How shawties would want me, ignoring all of my mileage <eos> We were losing our homies, we were dropping out college <eos> We were losing our way, just hoping that we could find it but look <eos> This that Holy Bible in a Gucci bag <eos> Word to Soulo Ho, might catch the holy coach <eos> Looking for my father, wonder where he at <eos> Still pray I never see you down, boy, that's a Holy Ghost <eos> Run it back, biking to the park or to the corner store <eos> J&J, Mama hit the grind and got us out the hood <eos> Where we at? Home of Ray Charles' mama and dreams <eos> From the minors to the show, homie, welcome to the league <eos> People love, people lie <eos> Grab the wheel, take a ride <eos> It’s you and yours, it's me and mine <eos> The memories, they never die <eos> No straight line and it's okay <eos> 'Cause you gon' find that they might fade, but <eos> The memories, they never die, the memories, they never die <eos> I lost my voice, still I'm the voice of the city <eos> I got it back, I'm a national treasure and God sent me <eos> It's God-written, I’ve been scribed in hieroglyphics <eos> My mind busy, the stressing, I clip it like Doc Rivers <eos> Gotta practice patience <eos> Youngins looking at me, I been grabbing spaceships <eos> Usher in my partners like we trading places <eos> We don’t forget the basics <eos> Had to fix the vision like I went and got Lasik <eos> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who the fairest of 'em all? <eos> Who ain’t never hit a lick, who ain't had that karma call? <eos> Who ain't try to study Big? Who ain't try to study Nas? <eos> Who ain’t try to study Jay in hopes that I would never fall? <eos> Yeah, aspire to inspire <eos> Chasing all my desires, follow me through the fire <eos> Swimming through troubled waters, do away with my idols <eos> Hoping we never grow up, still repeating the cycle <eos> People love, people lie <eos> Grab the wheel, take a ride <eos> It's you and yours, it's me and mine <eos> The memories, they never die <eos> No straight line and it's okay <eos> 'Cause you gon' find that they might fade, but <eos> The memories, they never die, the memories, they never die <eos> 
I am the pain of desire <eos> The god of the liars <eos> Another Messiah <eos> Against me conspire <eos> Get thrown in the fire <eos> Flames size of Goliath <eos> Screamin for air <eos> Lungs have turned into led <eos> Head covered red <eos> Eyes like they bled <eos> Sheep walkin dead <eos> Seen nothin yet <eos> Feed on the flesh <eos> Hunt down the rest <eos> Exit wounds in the back <eos> 6 tabs want no fuckin less <eos> Move out of sight <eos> When I'm looking for white knights <eos> To fry like it's sunday at night <eos> Bitch you're smelling like freight <eos> No surprise you'd be telling yourself all those lies <eos> Ash my blunt in your pie <eos> Slidin in out yo wife <eos> Break through take a step across the sealine <eos> Feed the goat eat a blotter 7 ways to see now <eos> Breath out blow smoke inhale  till its pitch dark <eos> Lights out yall down with no sound it's so sad <eos> Dripping with electrolytes on the omnisphere <eos> Bitches inside in my heart <eos> When im on a pill <eos> Frequencies filling my mind <eos> And I'm feeling ill <eos> Damn it I think fuck up my brain set <eos> I kinda feel <eos> That your bitch is now looking me <eos> I kinda feel <eos> You will not let me killing me <eos> Knives and pens <eos> And they won't feel like leaving me <eos> I kinda feel <eos> That I'm fucked and it's not morphine <eos> All of a sudden they think I can be <eos> All of a sudden they think I might be <eos> All of a sudden I count the metres to be back with her and my dreamings are real <eos> Back up the system <eos> And front we will win <eos> Facing the realest <eos> That ever can be <eos> Faith in my soul <eos> And I should be more keen <eos> On a fucking diameter of grill <eos> Bitches laid my room like Mordor <eos> Feeling fading on a fortune <eos> Dark and hail the Lxrd of <eos> Dead I said I mean it bitch get you dead <eos> Rolling in no peace <eos> And I'm so stuck I feel a bliss and they <eos> Trynna keep me calm <eos> But pussy boy I resist <eos> You can't fuck with me <eos> You can't fuck even with abyss <eos> Pussy boy Fake boy <eos> Come and get bitch what you wish <eos> Ain't no mains <eos> On my laps <eos> Ain't no shames <eos> Of my acts <eos> Ain't no lanes fairytales <eos> And she says she will trap <eos> With abyssus we said <eos> We will kill all the game <eos> They will pray for their save <eos> And again we will rise <eos> 
It's The Radical Sound, that revelatory flavour <eos> Rebellious rhythms accentuating this hater <eos> When he spits that sedition, when he writes it on paper <eos> The pen got a mind of its own; his vision fades <eos> Eyes straight ahead staring into space, spirit calling the rage <eos> Outta the hearts and  like minds to gravitate <eos> To the core of the Dark Side narrator <eos> The under-the-law but above whatever they got in store <eos> No bill of rights in my country supporting freedom of speech <eos> And a constitution polluted with man's hypocrisy <eos> But whatever, whichever man wanna come at him <eos> Will give witness to the definition of man <eos> Happily saying whatever, whenever, wherever to whom <eos> He damn well please; this man in control so get on your knees <eos> The book of Mike's first chapter of fight-the-power views <eos> The Radical Sound mixtape lighting the fuse <eos> See me donning the Guy Fawkes mask then rock the beat <eos> That reminds of an Anarchist march out in the street <eos> The level ya can't, level you won't meet <eos> Radicalisation of rhyme; you can't see me <eos> Suburban guerrilla, serial killer <eos> Axe in the raised fist, giving new definition to hacktivist <eos> Black-bag the black-baggers bagging the undesired <eos> Kill-list the critical parasitical individuals <eos> The ticks, pigs and bulls with their guns, grenades & pulls <eos> Playing the fool and when they act a fool I pull the curtains shut <eos> Grab the iron and then blow 'em open with "I give a fuck!" <eos> What ya gonna do? <eos> What ya gonna do when I come for you <eos> With a fistful of steel & the knowledge that this is true? <eos> The aggression of youth, idealism and wisdom <eos> The system is a prison; nine-mill pistons keeping the machine alive <eos> When you can't live right what's it mean to survive? (Nothing) <eos> So grab the mic or mega, bigger the better <eos> The Radical Sound sounding off, signing off forever <eos> Push the button, pull the lever and here we go <eos> The port cannon ready for the starboard show <eos> The port cannon blow supported by piratical flow <eos> Like the poetical version of Captain Jack Sparrow <eos> Like a Broken Arrow, I'm nowhere to be found <eos> So you'll feel this impact below and above the ground <eos> When I choose to drop this bomb get in the radius <eos> Pack in the bars, forget the stadiums <eos> And get blasted back by syntax <eos> Convoluted, polluted and lovingly groomed to croon to y'all crews <eos> Fucking with y'all views, y'all destined to lose <eos> When it come to the whack who got a short fuse? <eos> Keep busting the same old 420 and booze tracks <eos> Sex and flexing and party tracks <eos> 'Cos y'all help me to snap and write shit like this <eos> More substantial, check me on your list and hell yeah that's a dis' <eos> The Dark Side Poet ain't got time to lie; I'll lie when I die <eos> My life, my mind, my lines find the following paramount <eos> The Radical Sound <eos> 
"... tanto Pinocchio farà ancora una volta di testa sua, ormai c'è cascato, Gatto e Volpe l'hanno convinto a piantare le sue cinque monete d'oro nel Campo dei Miracoli, l'appuntamento è per mezzanotte, da domani, gli hanno detto che sarà ricco e questa sarà la sua notte dei miracoli..." <eos> Questa è la mia notte dei miracoli <eos> Domani tutto il mondo si stupirà di me <eos> Non dovrò accontentare più nessuno <eos> E imparerò la vita a modo mio <eos> Perché non devo credere ai miracoli <eos> Sto per passare il ponte tra i sogni e la realtà <eos> E di la forse spuntano le ali <eos> A quelli un po' speciali come me <eos> Tutti sanno tutto più di me <eos> Quante differenti verità <eos> Sono solo i guai che si assomigliano <eos> Questa notte scintillante cambia la vita mia <eos> Stringo in pugno finalmente tutto e di più <eos> La chiave del tesoro <eos> E' stupido star sempre male per essere normale <eos> Stanotte no <eos> Questa è la mia notte dei miracoli <eos> Camminerò sul filo tra stelle tutte mie <eos> Sceglierò quali amici avere intorno <eos> Magari un po' diversi come me <eos> E' un diritto la felicità <eos> Ho un biglietto per la libertà <eos> Se non giochi mai non puoi mai vincere <eos> Questa notte è perfetta e cambia la vita mia <eos> La fortuna non aspetta <eos> Quando ti dà appuntamento al buio <eos> A volte sono trappole d'amore e fantasia <eos> Stanotte no… <eos> A volte sono trappole d'amore e fantasia <eos> Stanotte no! <eos> Questa volta no, stanotte è mia <eos> 
I’m staring at a blank page <eos> The words I cannot find <eos> A chapter is unwritten <eos> I see outside the lines <eos> And I won’t get caught if I try to catch <eos> Another shooting star so I can make a wish <eos> Today is when the chapter will begin <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour it on me <eos> The wheels just keep on turning <eos> Like broken carousel <eos> Buying all distractions <eos> Like everybody else <eos> And I won’t get caught if I try to catch <eos> Another shooting star so I can make a wish <eos> Today is when the chapter will begin <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour it on me <eos> The open roads are finding me <eos> A hopeful hide in every sea <eos> As I’m looking to the highway <eos> Got some blue skies in the right place <eos> I run myself and back again <eos> From NYC to Disneyland <eos> Letting go of all the memories <eos> Giving fate a chance to catch me <eos> To catch me, to catch me <eos> Oooooh, ooh <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep shining <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> So I can keep smiling <eos> Another breath, another way <eos> Gonna make it through another day <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Oooh <eos> Pour a little heaven on me <eos> Oooh, yeah <eos> 
I want to take you everywhere I go <eos> Have you by my side <eos> Take a walk round in every town <eos> Drive across state lines <eos> Like the sun sends a golden stream <eos> In to our front room <eos> I could be the same old light <eos> For you <eos> Like the morning is always new <eos> I'll give it back to you <eos> Like the rain it just passes through <eos> For all you give <eos> I’ll give it back to you <eos> I think about it like a man in need <eos> Every time I'm gone <eos> Wait to see you like a mile long train is <eos> Passing by your door <eos> And my life is set around you now <eos> Tangled up the same <eos> And I will be <eos> The one who calls your name <eos> Like the night comes black and blue <eos> I'll give it back to you <eos> Like a road runs straight and true <eos> For all you give <eos> I’ll give it back to you <eos> 
Mountain of worry <eos> Mountain of song <eos> You ask how I'm doing <eos> Like you knew what was wrong <eos> Tell me just one time <eos> What I knew all along <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> If you don't call me <eos> I might lose my mind <eos> Can't keep concentrating <eos> On all the worry I find <eos> So just lend me your body <eos> I'll lend you mine <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> My eyelids are heavy <eos> My spirit is numb <eos> Don't know where I'm headed <eos> Don't know where I'm from <eos> I'm here just waiting <eos> For my day to come <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing <eos> You’re like Parker Posey in a magazine <eos> With fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three <eos> I wanna be your dressed in black <eos> Your dark star with the backwards hat <eos> I’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page <eos> Every page <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> I was a desert, honey you were the sand <eos> I was a bird, baby you were the branch <eos> And I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die <eos> It wasn't much, just everything <eos> You could've sat right there and got high with me <eos> But you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares <eos> Brought the nightmares <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> Hey pretty little mockingbird <eos> Keep singing them sad, sad songs <eos> There’s already rain on my window <eos> I’m dying when the morning comes <eos> Flew away in the night with the raven <eos> Now I’m underneath the willows hanging <eos> I’m too strung out to be upside down <eos> Pretty little mockingbird <eos> Pretty little mockingbird, sing your song <eos> 
I couldn't utter my love when it counted <eos> Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now <eos> And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted <eos> Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now <eos> Words hung above, but never would form <eos> Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn <eos> Remember me, love, when I'm reborn <eos> As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn <eos> I'd no idea on what ground I was founded <eos> All of that goodness is going with you now <eos> Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted <eos> All of my goodness is going with you now <eos> Dragging along, follow in your form <eos> Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn <eos> Remember me, love, when I'm reborn <eos> As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn <eos> I fled to the city with so much discounted <eos> Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now <eos> Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted <eos> Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now <eos> I was housed by your warmth, thus transformed <eos> By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn <eos> Remember me, love, when I'm reborn <eos> As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn <eos> 
They don't see you the way I do <eos> For them it's black and white <eos> For us it's technicolor <eos> Watching eyes on your every move <eos> They'll tell you who to be 'cause they don't know the other side <eos> The wild in your eyes <eos> That thing that only you can recognize <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow, mmm <eos> In your еyes I see evergreen <eos> And fiеlds of marigolds like they go on forever <eos> When we're there you and I are kings <eos> There's no one else to please so darling don't you ever go <eos> Thinking no one cares <eos> Just call my name <eos> And anytime you're scared <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow, mmm <eos> It's in your heart, in your mind <eos> It's every day, it's every night <eos> It's anywhere <eos> And everywhere you are <eos> Where you are <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you where the wild things grow <eos> And we can go exploring <eos> Underneath the midnight glow <eos> Let the darkest of nights ease your mind <eos> Free your soul <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Let's let this wild thing grow (Grow) <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> I'll meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos> Meet you in the forest <eos> 
Well I'm going back <eos> To that great old highway <eos> Where the muddy roads get washed out <eos> Into the riverbanks <eos> Heard the water's rising fast now <eos> Heard it's nothing like they've seen <eos> Well I guess I'm going back now <eos> 'Cause I've been feeling much the same <eos> Well once I had a home <eos> In that lowdown river town <eos> But now I'm a stranger <eos> To everyone around <eos> Whole world keeps on spinning <eos> You can try to hold on too <eos> I was gone 'fore the first frost <eos> In the pale November dew <eos> Well I'm going down <eos> Where the river meets the sea <eos> Yeah I'm gonna make a low bed <eos> Where the water's running deep <eos> The seasons keep on changing <eos> Like an endless melody <eos> Every moment passes <eos> Like a wave to the beach <eos> 
So you're scared and alone <eos> On the couch and you're stoned <eos> You're longing to feel <eos> But nothing that's real <eos> So you kept me on the line <eos> But never close to be mine <eos> What was the dream that you had <eos> When you woke up and you were sad? <eos> Remember the rooftop parties <eos> Remember the friends <eos> Remember the way I love you now <eos> And the way that I loved you then <eos> You spent all your timе <eos> With a bottle of wine <eos> And we'll nеver know <eos> If our love could have grown <eos> But you kept me on the line <eos> But never close to be mine <eos> What was the dream that you had <eos> When you woke up and you were sad? <eos> Remember the rooftop parties <eos> Remember the friends <eos> Remember the way I love you now <eos> And the way that I loved you then <eos> The way that I love you now <eos> And the way that I loved you then <eos> Maybe we know <eos> All the ways this could go <eos> All the ways it would end <eos> Were you ever my friend? <eos> Were you sad and alone <eos> When you broke on the phone? <eos> What was I to you <eos> As you passed through? <eos> Remember the rooftop parties <eos> Remember the friends <eos> Remember the way I love you now <eos> And the way that I loved you then <eos> Remember the rooftop parties <eos> Remember the friends <eos> Remember the way I love you now <eos> And the way that I loved you then <eos> 
In the night while my body slept in my bed <eos> my mind was running through the woods instead <eos> One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane <eos> One hundred miles an hour in my head. <eos> Vagabond dreamin' takes me through the night <eos> sippin' whiskey by the river living out of sight <eos> One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane <eos> One hundred miles an hour toward the light. <eos> See the curve in that river's bend <eos> I look at you and I see my friend <eos> One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane <eos> One hundred miles an hour till the end. <eos> My heart does beat like a Cherokee drum <eos> and in the morning when that sun does come <eos> One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane <eos> One hundred miles an hour till I'm done. <eos> 
Love is such a pretty thing <eos> But lately is been hard to find <eos> For I can taste it when the wind blows in <eos> And I can see it hiding on the mountain side <eos> But I never thought it could be this bad <eos> I lost all the love I had <eos> So Olivia won't you let me in <eos> Yeah I'm in love again <eos> And if I, if I was a wealthy man <eos> Don't you know I would spend all dimes on you <eos> And I held you, lover, in my giving hand <eos> Don't you know I would make it <eos> So all your dreams came true <eos> Cuz I never thought it could be this bad <eos> And I lost all the love I had <eos> So Olivia won't you let me in <eos> Yeah I'm in love again <eos> But how could you be so far away from me <eos> Why did you leave me all alone <eos> What can I do to make you love me too <eos> So I wrote a song for you <eos> But I'm still alone <eos> I'm all alone <eos> Yeah I remember when everything was gold <eos> Yeah I remember cuz doll I was sleeping with you <eos> But if I could do it all again <eos> Don't you know I would never, never ever run around on you <eos> Cuz I never thought it could be this bad <eos> Yeah and I lost all the love I had <eos> So Olivia won't you let me in <eos> Yeah I'm in love again <eos> Oh Olivia, lover won't you be my friend <eos> Yeah I'm in love again <eos>

Wait and see <eos> If the stones on my feet <eos> Turn to rubble <eos> On the open sea <eos> Float or sink <eos> I am rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> And the man in the cave is quiet <eos> Smiling to himself <eos> God, I wish I was quiet <eos> But my head is full of bells <eos> Something's always ringing <eos> My suitcase always smells <eos> Pour me a drink and then leave it <eos> On the edge of a wishing well <eos> On the edge of a wishing well <eos> Oh, can I bounce back <eos> Oh, or just lay ﬂat? <eos> Cathedral songs <eos> All night long <eos> Soaked in thunder <eos> I'm the stretchy man <eos> So jacked and tan <eos> Made of rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> And she's in a ballroom dancing <eos> And I'm singing through a hole in the wall <eos> I wanna build you a mansion <eos> Just trying to pay some dues is all <eos> And she's like Agatha Christie <eos> And I'm more like Voltaire <eos> Everything is a theory <eos> Carried away with the morning air <eos> Carried away with the morning air <eos> Oh, can I bounce back <eos> Oh, or just lay ﬂat? <eos> Only rubber <eos> Only rubber <eos> 
She's a little explosion of hope <eos> Never turns the lights down low, she can go there if you want to though <eos> There are no markings on her country roads <eos> No signs that show the way back home <eos> When you get there you won't wanna go <eos> I’ve frozen all my desire <eos> Covered up in virgin snow <eos> But when I stand beside her <eos> She burns yeah she burns <eos> Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks <eos> And I’m burning yeah I’m burning <eos> I’m burning so deep that just breathing hurts <eos> I’m melting darling, I can’t let go <eos> She likes to lay under the covers though <eos> Pretending everywhere’s our home <eos> Keeps me warm right to my very soul <eos> We get so tangled up its hard to know <eos> What is hers and what’s my own <eos> Vines at the bottom of an olive grove <eos> I’ve frozen all my desire <eos> Covered up in virgin snow <eos> But when I stand beside her <eos> She burns yeah she burns <eos> Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks <eos> And I’m burning yeah I’m burning <eos> I’m burning so deep that just breathing hurts <eos> I’m melting darling, I can’t let go <eos> I’m melting darling, I can’t let go <eos> I’m melting darling, I can’t let go <eos> 
You try to drown your sorrows, shouldn’t taught them how to swim <eos> And now you are right back where you began <eos> Winter skies approaching, all alone in the wasteland <eos> Alone is the only way that they let you in <eos> So drink all my wine, cut all my trees <eos> Make love on my beaches, smoke all my weed <eos> I am California, can’t you see? <eos> Wherever you roam, you’ll always want me <eos> We struggle with our lovers, we don’t know what to let in <eos> 'Cause the new ones pay for the old ones sins <eos> Blinded by your shadows, faded on your love <eos> You don’t know how deep you are till you get pulled back up <eos> So drink all my wine, cut all my trees <eos> Make love on my beaches, smoke all my weed <eos> I am California, can’t you see? <eos> Wherever you roam, you’ll always want me <eos> So drink all my wine, cut all my trees <eos> Make love on my beaches, smoke all my weed <eos> I am California, can’t you see? <eos> Wherever you roam, you’ll always want me <eos> Yeah, dig all my gold, soak in my springs <eos> Conquer my mountains if that’s what you need <eos> I am California, can’t you see? <eos> Wherever you roam, you’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> Yeah, you’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want me <eos> You’ll always want <eos> Want me <eos> Ahh, hmm mmm <eos> 
I carry the time we don't talk in a backpack <eos> Leave it on the side with the nights you didn't call me back <eos> And all the ideas, and the hope I'd never ask him for <eos> I'll throw them away, it's okay, without a second thought <eos> God, I swore I wouldn't play the age-old game <eos> Yeah, I watched you all ask all your lovers away <eos> Rollin' your eyes to the backs of your heads <eos> Surely you know to close them instead <eos> Cool girl will be different <eos> I'll be quiet, oh so easy <eos> Cool girl will be different <eos> I'll be quiet, oh so easy <eos> How much of a tongue can I bite until we notice blood? <eos> Spit to the left, carry on, just smile and say you're good <eos> You all plead and demand all your needs, but you can't <eos> He'll be asked till he's bored, I would know, I've been bored before <eos> Chill out if it's late or every heavy sigh will seal a fate <eos> God, I swore I wouldn't play the age-old game <eos> Yeah, I watched you all ask all your lovers away <eos> Rollin' your eyes to the backs of your heads <eos> Surely you know to close them instead <eos> Cool girl will be different <eos> I'll be quiet, I'll be easy <eos> Cool girl will be different <eos> I'll be quiet, I'll be easy <eos> (No, I won't be like them) <eos> Cool girl will be different <eos> I'll be quiet, I'll be easy <eos> (Want me more than friend) <eos> Cool girl, I'll be different <eos> I'll be quiet, I'll be easy <eos> (No, I won't be like them) <eos> Cool girl, I'll be different <eos> I'll be quiet, I'll be easy <eos> (I'll be quiet again) <eos> I'll be easy <eos> Oh, so easy <eos> 
Say it's here where our pieces fall in place <eos> Any rain softly kisses us on the face <eos> Any wind means we're running <eos> We can sleep and see 'em coming <eos> Where we drift and call it dreaming <eos> We can weep and call it singing <eos> Where we break when our hearts are strong enough <eos> We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood <eos> Where we see enough to follow <eos> We can hear when we are hollow <eos> Where we keep the light we're given <eos> We can lose and call it living <eos> Where the sun isn't only sinking fast <eos> Every night knows how long it's supposed to last <eos> Where the time of our lives is all we have <eos> And we get a chance to say, before we ease away <eos> For all the love you've left behind <eos> You can have mine <eos> Say it's here where our pieces fall in place <eos> We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray <eos> Where our water isn't hidden <eos> We can burn and be forgiven <eos> Where our hands hurt from healing <eos> We can laugh without a reason <eos> 'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast <eos> Every moon and our bodies make shining glass <eos> Where the time of our lives is all we have <eos> And we get a chance to say, before we ease away <eos> For all the love you've left behind <eos> You can have mine <eos> 
It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in <eos> Or the light coming off of your skin <eos> The fragile heart you protected for so long <eos> Or the mercy in your sense of right and wrong <eos> It's not your hands searching slow in the dark <eos> Or your nails leaving love's watermark <eos> It's not the way you talk me off the roof <eos> Your questions like directions to the truth <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> If we were vampires and death was a joke <eos> We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke <eos> Laugh at all the lovers and their plans <eos> I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand <eos> Maybe time running out is a gift <eos> I'll work hard 'til the end of my shift <eos> And give you every second I can find <eos> And hope it isn't me who's left behind <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> It's knowing that this can't go on forever <eos> Likely one of us will have to spend some days alone <eos> Maybe we'll get forty years together <eos> But one day I'll be gone <eos> Or one day you'll be gone <eos> 
In your ribs <eos> I see more than bones <eos> Something lost <eos> I had long ago <eos> All the words <eos> Are meaning so much more <eos> As you say them <eos> Without a clause <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> In white water <eos> An open hand <eos> You found my wreck <eos> In pieces there <eos> And all my resin <eos> Glowing red <eos> Could turn to amber <eos> I will still be there <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> Now I'm letting all you in <eos> You caught me falling <eos> 
Try to do right by your body <eos> But your body says it can't make up its mind <eos> Singing the song of your body <eos> But the melody is changing all the time <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> And when the blood runs <eos> And you wonder if you're ringing like a bell <eos> You can have your fun <eos> But you'll never know if you danced for yourself <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> Try to do right by your body <eos> But it's always taking bidders on the side <eos> There at the end with it <eos> But your body falls to pieces and you look to the sky <eos> So you stand at the window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They are waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how to walk <eos> So you stand at thе window <eos> Put the bar across the door <eos> And fold up your arms <eos> They arе waiting, but <eos> I cannot go <eos> I do not know how <eos> 
If you wake up someday soon <eos> In a great big house, in a new bedroom <eos> If you get to thinkin' 'bout the passing of time <eos> Circumstances, years are strange <eos> The same old people have new last names <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still loving you the best that I can <eos> If some weekend evening, your kind new man <eos> At a black tie party, he takes your hand <eos> If you make your entrance in that dress that I liked <eos> If sometime later, you should meet <eos> Some quiet stranger who talks like me <eos> And if for a moment, I am crossing your mind <eos> I hope it lingers <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the weeds, find me in the dark <eos> Divin' underneath, fightin' off the sharks <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me in the wrong, find me in the right <eos> Find me in the calm in the middle of the night <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos> Find me still lovin' you the best that I can <eos>

I hear a lot about sinners <eos> Don't think that I’ll be a saint <eos> But I might go down to the river <eos> 'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch <eos> Yeah, it's making me say <eos> That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy <eos> On God <eos> Runnin’ to the altar like a track star <eos> Can't wait another second <eos> 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy <eos> I don't do well with the drama <eos> And, no, I can't stand it being fake <eos> (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no) <eos> I don't believe in nirvana <eos> But the way that we love in the night gave mе life <eos> Baby, I can't explain <eos> That the way you hold mе, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Yes, oh God) <eos> On God <eos> Runnin' to the altar like a track star <eos> Can’t wait another second <eos> ’Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> Feels so holy <eos> They say we're too young and <eos> The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'" <eos> Wise men say fools rush in <eos> But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> They say we're too young and <eos> The pimps and the players say, "Don’t go crushin'" <eos> Wise men say fools rush in <eos> But I don't know <eos> The first step pleases the Father <eos> Might be the hardest to take <eos> But when you come out of the water <eos> I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy <eos> Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci <eos> They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy <eos> But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi <eos> Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed <eos> When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi <eos> Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski <eos> I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week <eos> I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child <eos> I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud <eos> If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds <eos> I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud <eos> Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up <eos> Formalize the union in communion, He can trust <eos> I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us <eos> I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us <eos> 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me <eos> (Feels so) Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy (Feels so) <eos> 
Found you when your heart was broke <eos> I filled your cup until it overflowed <eos> Took it so far to keep you close <eos> I was afraid to leave you on your own <eos> Said I'd catch you if you fall <eos> And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all <eos> And then I got you off your knees <eos> Put you right back on your feet <eos> Just so you could take advantage of me <eos> Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? <eos> Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me <eos> You know I'm the one who put you up there <eos> Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? <eos> Live without me <eos> Go on and live without me <eos> Baby, I'm the one who put you up there <eos> I don't know why, yeah <eos> I gave love 'bout a hundred tries <eos> Just runnin' from the demons in your mind <eos> Then I took yours and made 'em mine <eos> I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind <eos> Said I'd catch you if you fall <eos> And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all <eos> And then I got you off your knees <eos> Put you right back on your feet <eos> Just so you could take advantage of me <eos> Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? <eos> Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me <eos> You know I'm the one who put you up there <eos> Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? <eos> Live without me <eos> Go on and live without me <eos> Baby, I'm the one who put you up there <eos> I don't know why, yeah <eos> You don't have to say just what you did <eos> I already know <eos> I had to go and find out from them <eos> So tell me, how's it feel? <eos> Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there? <eos> Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me <eos> You know I'm the one who put you up there <eos> Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely? <eos> Live without me <eos> Live without me <eos> 'Cause baby, I'm the one who put you up there <eos> I don't know why, yeah <eos> 
Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you brokе me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a whilе, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first, oh <eos> You broke me first, oh <eos> 
I fell by the wayside like everyone else <eos> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself <eos> Our every moment, I start to replace <eos> 'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was never the right time, whenever you called <eos> Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all <eos> Our every moment, I start to replay <eos> But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Would we be better off by now <eos> If I'd have let my walls come down? <eos> Maybe, I guess we'll never know <eos> You know, you know <eos> Before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> 
I've been holding my breath <eos> I've been counting to ten <eos> Over something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm alone in bed <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
I wonder if I'm being real <eos> Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel? <eos> I wonder, wouldn't it be nice <eos> To live inside a world that isn't black and white? <eos> I wonder what it's like to be my friends <eos> Hope that they don't think I forget about them <eos> I wonder, I wonder <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by <eos> I wonder why I'm so afraid <eos> Of saying something wrong and nevеr said I was a saint <eos> I wonder, when I cry into my hands <eos> I'm conditioned to feel likе it makes me less of a man <eos> And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side <eos> And tell me that the world will end up alright <eos> I wonder, I wonder <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by <eos> Right before I close my eyes <eos> The only thing that's on my mind <eos> Been dreamin' that you feel it too <eos> I wonder what it's like to be loved by you <eos>

The curtains are closed now, nothin' to see <eos> But a dozen dying roses at our feet <eos> Your timing is perfect, ironic to me <eos> Showin' up the moment that you shouldn't be, oh <eos> Last time I checked, you're the one that left <eos> Last words you've said, that you couldn't care less <eos> It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me <eos> How you couldn't give me everythin' and now you want it from me <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos> Yeah, it's funny how you callin' <eos> Couldn't answer if I wanted <eos> 'Cause his lips are on my lips, and both my hands are on his body <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos> Sendin' a message through mutual friends <eos> It's like I'm talking to you using them <eos> You heard I was happy and I heard you're not <eos> I guess freedom didn't free you like you thought, oh <eos> Last time I checked, you're the one that left (You're the one that left) <eos> Last words you've said, that you couldn't care less <eos> It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me <eos> How you couldn't give me everythin' and now you want it from me <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos> Yeah, it's funny how you callin' <eos> Couldn't answer if I wanted <eos> 'Cause his lips are on my lips, and both my hands are on his body <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos> Who's laughin' now? <eos> Who's laughin' now? <eos> Who's laughin' now? <eos> Who's laughin' now? <eos> It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me <eos> How you couldn't give me everythin' and now you want it from me <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos> Yeah, it's funny how you callin' <eos> Couldn't answer if I wanted <eos> 'Cause his lips are on my lips, and both my hands are on his body <eos> Yeah, it's funny how it's different now that I got somebody <eos> Yeah, it's funny (Yeah, it's funny, ooh) <eos>

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January <eos> And this is our place, we make the rules <eos> And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear <eos> Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years? <eos> Can I go where you go? <eos> Can we always be this close? <eos> Forever and ever, ah <eos> Take me out, and take me home <eos> You're my, my, my, my lover <eos> We could let our friends crash in the living room <eos> This is our place, we make the call <eos> And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you <eos> I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all <eos> Can I go where you go? <eos> Can we always be this close? <eos> Forever and ever, ah <eos> Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever) <eos> You're my, my, my, my lover <eos> Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand? <eos> With every guitar string scar on my hand <eos> I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover <eos> My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue <eos> All's well that ends well to end up with you <eos> Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover <eos> And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me <eos> And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover <eos> Can I go where you go? <eos> Can we always be this close? <eos> Forever and ever, ah <eos> Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever) <eos> You're my, my, my, my <eos> Oh, you're my, my, my, my <eos> Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover <eos> 
Stuck here <eos> Stuck here in these waters <eos> So sick to my stomach <eos> Is anybody there? <eos> Red lights <eos> Red lights in the darkness <eos> Everyone's so heartless <eos> Does anybody care? <eos> It's so hard to explain <eos> With your heart in a cage <eos> Only whisper but you wanna shout <eos> 'Cause the second you wake <eos> Too much pressure to take <eos> Every part of you wants to cry out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Causе we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alonе out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> Mirror <eos> Mirror on the wall <eos> I don't see beautiful <eos> Staring back at me <eos> Watching <eos> Watching my heart bleed out <eos> Trying not to freak out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> So ohh <eos> And the worst part is when they smile like this <eos> And it hits me hard, hits me hard <eos> Tryin' to play it cool but inside I'm bruised <eos> And it breaks my heart, breaks my heart <eos> It's hard for all of us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> They don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> 
We're in the homestretch of the hard times <eos> We took a hard left, but we're alright <eos> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but <eos> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good (Mmm) <eos> Well, call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I <eos> Can't even mess it up, although we both try <eos> No, it don't always go the way we planned it <eos> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when my bones are good <eos> When the bones are good <eos> Mmm, when the bones are good <eos> Bones are good, the rest, baby, it don't matter <eos> Paint could peel, the glass <eos> Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> 
That first night, we were standin' at your door <eos> Fumblin' for your keys, then I kissed you <eos> Ask me if I wanna come inside <eos> 'Cause we didn't wanna end the night <eos> Then you took my hand and I followed you <eos> Yeah, I see us in black and white <eos> Crystal clear on a starlit night <eos> In all your gorgeous colours <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> See you standing in your dress <eos> Swear in front of all our friends <eos> There'll never be another <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room <eos> Tellin' stories while we share a drink or two <eos> And there's a vision I've been holdin' in my mind <eos> We're sixty-five and you ask <eos> When did I first know, I always knew <eos> And I see us in black and white <eos> Crystal clear on a starlit night <eos> In all your gorgeous colours <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> See you standing in your dress <eos> Swear in front of all our friends <eos> There'll never be another <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> And I want the world to witness when we finally say "I do" <eos> It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you <eos> I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons <eos> But at night, when I close my eyes <eos> I see us in black and white <eos> Crystal clear on a starlit night <eos> There'll never be another <eos> I promise that I'll love you <eos> I see us in black and white <eos> Crystal clear on a starlit night <eos> In all your gorgeous colours <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> See you standing in your dress <eos> Swear in front of all our friends <eos> There'll never be another <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> And there'll never be another <eos> I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life <eos> 
Still tryna lose the thought of your face <eos> But I think about you all the time <eos> I know we said we'd give each other space <eos> Just need to know you're alright <eos> Heard from your mom, you got some new tattoos <eos> Moved out of state <eos> Don't mean no pressure, just need to make sure <eos> That you're okay <eos> Although feelings faded <eos> We're not strangers <eos> Just because we're not friends doesn't mean I don't care <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> Don't know how to just stop, used to love you too much <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> 'Cause I've been losing sleep <eos> Wondering if you'rе good, so please <eos> Just pick your phone up, lеt me know and I'll stop <eos> Are you alright? Just say you're all alright <eos> Think I needed space, some time alone <eos> Really just to get my head straight <eos> So I saw the world 'til I went broke <eos> And tried to not look at my phone <eos> Heard from my mom, you called her and dad to ask <eos> How I've been <eos> But I'm still not ready, too hurt and angry <eos> To let you in <eos> Although feelings faded <eos> We're not strangers <eos> Just because we're not friends doesn't mean I don't care <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> Don't know how to just stop, used to love you too much <eos> Are you alright, alright? <eos> 'Cause I've been losing sleep <eos> Wondering if you're good, so please <eos> Just pick your phone up, let me know and I'll stop <eos> Are you alright? Just say you're all alright <eos> (Oh yeah) <eos> Just say you're all alright <eos> (Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, ayy) <eos> 'Cause I've been losing sleep <eos> Wondering if you're good, so please (So please) <eos> Just pick your phone up, let me know and I'll stop <eos> Are you alright? Just say you're all alright <eos> Just say you're all alright <eos> 
I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> Not what you'd think <eos> And if I'm bein' honest <eos> It might've been a nightmare <eos> To anyone who might care <eos> Thought I could fly (Fly) <eos> So I stepped off the Golden, mm <eos> Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried) <eos> Nobody even noticed <eos> I saw them standing right there <eos> Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care) <eos> I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> But when I wake up, I see <eos> You with me <eos> And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you <eos> Don't wanna lie here, but you can lеarn to <eos> If I could change the way that you see yourself <eos> You wouldn't wondеr why you hear <eos> 'They don't deserve you'" <eos> I tried to scream <eos> But my head was underwater <eos> They called me weak <eos> Like I'm not just somebody's daughter <eos> Coulda been a nightmare <eos> But it felt like they were right there <eos> And it feels like yesterday was a year ago <eos> But I don't wanna let anybody know <eos> 'Cause everybody wants something from me now <eos> And I don't wanna let 'em down <eos> I had a dream <eos> I got everything I wanted <eos> But when I wake up, I see <eos> You with me <eos> And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you <eos> Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to <eos> If I could change the way that you see yourself <eos> You wouldn't wonder why you hear <eos> 'They don't deserve you'" <eos> If I knew it all then, would I do it again? <eos> Would I do it again? <eos> If they knew what they said would go straight to my head <eos> What would they say instead? <eos> If I knew it all then, would I do it again? <eos> Would I do it again? <eos> If they knew what they said would go straight to my head <eos> What would they say instead? <eos>

The day after you said, "Goodbye" <eos> All I did was lay in bed and cry <eos> But after one month, I started to move on <eos> And after two, I felt alright <eos> Then three months in, you were off my mind <eos> And month four and five, I was living my life <eos> I was better and didn't have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive <eos> 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> The day after you had reached out <eos> I was broken for the second time around <eos> I prayed on the third day that I would be okay <eos> That I'd forget you were ever mine <eos> Oh, I don't think you realize <eos> How long I had to fight to be living my life <eos> To get better and never have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive <eos> 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Do you remember? <eos> Remember? <eos> We went for a drive <eos> 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> 
I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater <eos> You said it looked better on me than it did you <eos> Only if you knew, how much I liked you <eos> But I watched your eyes as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> I wish I were Heather <eos> Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand <eos> Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder <eos> But how could I hate her? She's such an angel <eos> But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> I wish I were Heather <eos> Oh, I wish I were Heather <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> I wish I were Heather <eos> 
It's crazy when <eos> The thing you love the most is the detriment <eos> Let that sink in <eos> You can think again <eos> When the hand you wanna hold is a weapon and <eos> You're nothin' but skin <eos> Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> I keep running, I keep running, I keep running <eos> They say I may be making a mistake <eos> I would have followed all the way, no matter how far <eos> I know when you go down all your darkest roads <eos> I would have followed all the way to the graveyard <eos> Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> I keep running when both my feet hurt <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads <eos> I would have followed all the way to the graveyard <eos> No, oh <eos> You look at me (Look at me) <eos> With eyes so dark, don't know how you even see <eos> You push right through me (Push right through me) <eos> It's gettin' real <eos> You lock the door, you're drunk at the steering wheel <eos> And I can't conceal <eos> Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> I keep running, I keep running, I keep running <eos> They say I may be making a mistake <eos> I would have followed all the way, no matter how far <eos> I know when you go down all your darkest roads <eos> I would have followed all the way to the graveyard <eos> Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> I keep running when both my feet hurt <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads <eos> I would have followed all the way to the graveyard <eos> It's funny how <eos> The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies <eos> Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> I keep running when both my feet hurt <eos> I won't stop 'til I get where you are <eos> Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads <eos> I would have followed all the way to the graveyard <eos> No, oh <eos> 
Our love was stronger than lightning <eos> Soft as the cotton you lie in <eos> Times we got hot like an iron, you and I <eos> Our hearts had never been broken <eos> We were so innocent darling <eos> We used to talk 'til the morning, you and I <eos> We had that mixtape on every weekend <eos> Had it repeating, had it repeating <eos> You were my September Song, summer lasted too long <eos> Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen <eos> You were my September Song, tell me where have you gone <eos> Do you remember me? We were only fifteen <eos> And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us <eos> You were my September song, tell me where have you gone <eos> Do you remember me? We were only fifteen <eos> Sometimes I think that I see your <eos> Face in the strangest of places <eos> Down on the underground station passing by <eos> I get a mad sense of danger <eos> Feel like my heart couldn't take it <eos> 'Cause if we met we'd be strangers, you and I <eos> Still, I play that mixtape every weekend <eos> Got it repeating, got it repeating <eos> You were my September song, summer lasted too long <eos> Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen <eos> You were my September song, tell me where have you gone? <eos> Do you remember me? We were only fifteen <eos> And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us <eos> I hear that September song and I'm singing along <eos> Thinking about you and me, oh, what a melody <eos> And as the years go by <eos> You will still be my, be my <eos> September song <eos> You are my <eos> September song <eos> You were my September song, summer lasted too long <eos> Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen <eos> You were my September song, tell me where have you gone <eos> Do you remember me? We were only fifteen <eos> And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us <eos> You were my September song <eos> I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us <eos> 
Come home early after class <eos> Don't be hanging 'round the back of the schoolyard <eos> I've been called up by your teacher <eos> She said she can't even reach you 'cause you're so far <eos> You've been talking with your fists <eos> We didn't raise you up like this, now did we? <eos> There've been changes in this house <eos> Things you don't know about in this family <eos> It don't make sense, but nevertheless <eos> You gotta believe us, it's all for the best <eos> It don't make sense <eos> The way things go <eos> Son, you should know <eos> Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love <eos> Sometimes two homes are better than one <eos> Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young <eos> Yeah, you'll understand <eos> When you love someone <eos> There ain't no one here to blame <eos> And nothing's going to change with your old friends <eos> Your room will stay the same <eos> 'Cause you'll only be away on the weekends <eos> It don't make sense but nevertheless <eos> You gotta believe us, it's all for the best <eos> It don't make sense <eos> It don't add up <eos> But we'll always love you no matter what <eos> Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love <eos> Sometimes two homes are better than one <eos> Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young <eos> Yeah, you'll understand <eos> When you love someone <eos> When you love someone <eos> Come home early after class <eos> Don't be hanging 'round the back of the schoolyard <eos> And if we're crying on the couch <eos> Don't let it freak you out <eos> It's just been so hard <eos> Sometimes moms and dads fall out of love <eos> Sometimes the best intentions just ain't enough <eos> Some things you can't tell your sister 'cause she's still too young <eos> Yeah, you'll understand <eos> When you love someone (Mmm) <eos> When you love someone (Oh, no, no, no) <eos> When you love someone (Oooh) <eos> When you love someone (Mmm) <eos> 
Oh dear, oh dear, I’m sorry <eos> That you grew up so soon <eos> A cold year and no high school parties <eos> I’ve been drinking alone <eos> Oh, I’ve been drinking alone <eos> So, don't fear, don’t fear their warnings <eos> They’re bitterer than most <eos> 4 years of driving across the country <eos> For empty seats at their shows <eos> And they’ve been drinking alone <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos> So when you’re mad for no reason <eos> At everything at once <eos> And when you start overthinking <eos> I’ll be drinking at home <eos> Oh, I’ll be drinking at home <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos> And if you want, I could tell the truth <eos> That this life takes a toll on you <eos> I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> And if you want, I could tell the truth <eos> That this life takes a toll on you <eos> I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> In the morning, I’m bullet proof <eos> So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble <eos> Start your life in the middle of the jungle <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry <eos> Stay alive, try to lose all of your money <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> You young, young blood <eos> Young blood <eos>

Walking down 29th and park <eos> I saw you in another's arm <eos> Only a month we've been apart <eos> You look happier <eos> Saw you walk inside a bar <eos> He said something to make you laugh <eos> I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours <eos> Yeah, you look happier, you do <eos> Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody love you like I do <eos> Promise that I will not take it personal, baby <eos> If you're moving on with someone new <eos> 'Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I'll feel it too <eos> And until then I'll smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Sat in the corner of the room <eos> Everything's reminding me of you <eos> Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself <eos> You're happier, aren't you? <eos> Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you <eos> But ain't nobody need you like I do <eos> I know that there's others that deserve you <eos> But my darling, I am still in love with you <eos> But I guess you look happier, you do <eos> My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too <eos> I could try to smile to hide the truth <eos> But I know I was happier with you <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> Hey yeah, hey yeah <eos> ‘Cause baby you look happier, you do <eos> I knew one day you’d fall for someone new <eos> But if he breaks your heart like lovers do <eos> Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you <eos> 
Pop the cork on yesterday's wine <eos> 'Cause I don't feel like going out tonight <eos> Let's spin a couple of forty-fives <eos> And order some Chinese takeout <eos> Do the dishes and turn down the lights <eos> Watch West Side Story for the eighteenth time <eos> I couldn't think of a better way to spend my Friday night <eos> No cover charge or taxicabs <eos> C'mon, baby, what do you say? <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> I'm more about the right here, right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Never cared much for fancy champagne <eos> Unpronounceable fancy French names <eos> I'd much rather just sit on the couch and make out <eos> Mmm, it's been a long hard week <eos> And I don't want nothing but you holding me <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> I'm more about the right here, right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date, hey <eos> Come a little closer baby <eos> Let me be your cheap date <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Put my little black dress away <eos> 'Cause I'm not really into the party downtown <eos> No, I'm more about the you and me, right here and right now <eos> Think of all the loving we'll make <eos> Think of all the money we'll save <eos> You don't have to go far to take me home <eos> I'll be your cheap date <eos> Ooh, I'll be your cheap date <eos> 
August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
Wandering soul <eos> Wandering mind <eos> Wondering what’s gone wrong with me <eos> And try not to try <eos> Swayed by the wind <eos> Swayed by desire <eos> Can’t reach the moon up above <eos> And I don’t dare touch the fire <eos> 'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> And I want you all the time <eos> Always on my mind <eos> Always alone <eos> You could be miles and miles away <eos> But somehow you're close <eos> If I can't have my cake <eos> And I can't eat it too <eos> Well, I guess the sound of your voice <eos> In the aching will just have to do <eos> 'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> And I want you all the time <eos> And if you never come back <eos> If you never call <eos> I say I'll understand when I don’t at all <eos> 'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> And I want you all the time <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> The trouble with wanting is I want you <eos> I see you there and I see that line <eos> (The trouble with wanting is I want you) <eos> And I want you all the time <eos> Oh, I want you all the time <eos> 
A dangerous plan, just this time <eos> A stranger's hand clutched in mine <eos> I'll take this chance, so call me blind <eos> I've been waiting all my life <eos> Please don't scar this young heart <eos> Just take my hand <eos> I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> Hold me close through the night <eos> Don't let me go, we'll be alright <eos> Touch my soul and hold it tight <eos> I've been waiting all my life <eos> I won't scar your young heart <eos> Just take my hand <eos> 'Cause I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> Please don't go, I've been waiting so long <eos> Oh, you don't even know me at all <eos> But I was made for loving you <eos> I was made for loving you <eos> Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through <eos> Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do <eos> All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you <eos> 
Sweet creature <eos> Had another talk about where it's going wrong <eos> But we're still young <eos> We don't know where we're going <eos> But we know where we belong <eos> And, oh, we started <eos> Two hearts in one home <eos> It's hard when we argue <eos> We're both stubborn, I know <eos> But oh <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> Wherever I go, you bring me home <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> When I run out of road, you bring me home <eos> Sweet creature <eos> Running through the garden <eos> Oh, where nothing bothered us <eos> But we're still young <eos> I always think about you and how we don't speak enough <eos> And, oh, we started <eos> Two hearts in one home <eos> I know it's hard when we argue <eos> We're both stubborn, I know <eos> But oh <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> Wherever I go, you bring me home <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> When I run out of road, you bring me home <eos> And, oh, when we started <eos> Just two hearts in one home <eos> It gets hard when we argue <eos> We're both stubborn, I know <eos> But oh <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> Wherever I go, you bring me home <eos> Sweet creature, sweet creature <eos> When I run out of road, you bring me home <eos> You'll bring me home <eos> 
Sometimes I think about the ones that we’ve replaced <eos> All the millions underneath the burnt and waste <eos> And I get sad because, of course, we’ll be the same <eos> All of history collapsing in its wake <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> I heard that someday when they look up at the night <eos> They’ll see nothing but a black and starless sky <eos> And they’ll tell stories of some old and callow time <eos> Claiming spectacles of brilliant burning lights <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> So maybe this is what it takes to realize <eos> I am grateful just that I have been alive <eos> And I’ll be happy if I look back on my life <eos> Been a sister, been a mother, been a wife <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have laid here <eos> Maybe it’s enough that I have known inside my head, and <eos> Maybe it’s enough to know that we were here together <eos> And that we are the ones <eos> We are the ones <eos> We are the ones for now <eos> 
Waiting here for someone <eos> Only yesterday we were on the run <eos> You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun <eos> Now I'm waiting here for someone <eos> And oh, love, do you feel this rough? <eos> Why's it only you I'm thinking of? <eos> My shadow's dancing <eos> Without you for the first time <eos> My heart is hoping <eos> You'll walk right in tonight <eos> And tell me there are things that you regret <eos> Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet <eos> That's all I'm asking <eos> Is it too much to ask? <eos> Is it too much to ask? <eos> Someone's moving outside <eos> And lights come on down the drive <eos> I forget you're not here when I close my eyes <eos> Do you still think of me sometimes? <eos> And oh, love, watch the sun coming up <eos> Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love? <eos> My shadow's dancing <eos> Without you for the first time <eos> My heart is hoping <eos> You'll walk right in tonight <eos> And tell me there are things that you regret <eos> Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet <eos> That's all I'm asking <eos> Is it too much to ask? <eos> My shadow's dancing <eos> Without you for the first time <eos> My heart is hoping <eos> You'll walk right in tonight <eos> And tell me there are things that you regret <eos> Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet <eos> My shadow's dancing <eos> Without you for the first time <eos> My heart is hoping <eos> You'll walk right in tonight <eos> And tell me there are things that you regret <eos> Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet <eos> That's all I'm asking <eos> Is it too much to ask? <eos> That's all I'm asking <eos> Is it too much to ask? <eos> 
I had a dream of you and I <eos> Carried on waves of happiness <eos> Opened my eyes and we're hanging on tight <eos> To a sinking ship and I'm losing grip <eos> Living on different frequencies <eos> And I see you less frequently <eos> Time after time we just pass in the night <eos> We're a sinking ship <eos> You can let go of it <eos> So I wait, wait a little longer <eos> And I wait with the bruises and scars <eos> And I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger <eos> 'Cause together, together <eos> Is tearing us apart <eos> And she said, "Look at those cracks, won't you fix them up?" <eos> And, "You did this to us, don't you dare give up" <eos> And though, my arms are open <eos> My heart is shut tight <eos> But I can't disconnect <eos> When I wanna protect you <eos> So I wait, wait a little longer <eos> And I wait with the bruises and scars <eos> And I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger <eos> 'Cause together, together <eos> We're not living our lives <eos> Are we living a lie? <eos> Are we just treading water? <eos> Caught up in the tide <eos> If we're gonna survive, gotta sever the ties, oh no <eos> But until then <eos> I will wait, wait a little longer <eos> And I'll wait with the bruises and scars <eos> And I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger <eos> 'Cause together, together <eos> I will wait, wait a little longer <eos> And I'll wait with the bruises and scars <eos> And I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger <eos> 'Cause together, together <eos> 'Cause together, together <eos> Is tearing us apart <eos> 
I want someone to remind me to wear sunscreen <eos> And take my vitamins when it slips my mind <eos> I want someone who knows how I like my coffee <eos> And wants to share a bed for more than a night <eos> But I'm stubborn, selfish, easily jealous at times <eos> I'm hard to love, and I just want someone to try <eos> I want someone who knows that I'm not made for mornings <eos> And doesn't scold me for smoking when I drink <eos> I want someone who listens when they've heard the stories <eos> And gives me enough space to breathe <eos> Cause I'm stubborn, selfish, and easily jealous at times <eos> I'm hard to love, and I just want someone to try <eos> To try <eos> I want someone who can ground me when I'm too high <eos> And light up the dark side of my head <eos> I want someone to share my coffee, my sunscreen <eos> My mornings, my stories, and my bed <eos> Someone stubborn, selfish, and easily jealous would be fine <eos> I won't mind if they're hard to love <eos> I just want someone <eos> To try <eos> 
(Verse 1) <eos> I’ve got a lot to learn, you’ve got a lot to give <eos> We can go anywhere, rebuild this broken bridge <eos> You’ve got a heart of gold, I’ve got a mind that goes <eos> On and on and on to places we’ll never know, but <eos> (Chorus) <eos> I just want to be with you when the day is done <eos> When the darkness comes <eos> When the ol’ sweet day is done <eos> I just want to be with you in the setting sun <eos> ’til the morning comes <eos> When the day is done, whoa-oh <eos> Mm-mm-mmmm <eos> When the ol’ sweet day is done <eos> (Verse 2) <eos> If you got it figured it out, then I’m going round and round <eos> But darling I’ll lift you up, ’cause I know you won’t let me down <eos> I want you to meet me there by the well where we used to drink <eos> I will draw the water if you quench these thirsty lips, ’cause <eos> (Chorus) <eos> (Verse 3) <eos> I’ve walked a million miles <eos> You’ve made the perfect home <eos> You and me will be alright <eos> As long as we’re not alone, cause <eos> (Chorus) <eos> (End) <eos> Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh <eos> When the day is done <eos> When the day is done <eos> Whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh <eos> When the ol’ sweet day is done <eos> 
I've been falling for her <eos> While you've been falling for me <eos> You're asking for the space in my heart <eos> But my heart is no longer with me <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could dry your eyes <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> It could be easy <eos> If I could split my heart right into three <eos> For you, for her, for me <eos> I don't love you <eos> Any less than before <eos> But I can't love you anymore <eos> There are times I can't see us apart <eos> But even a broken clock is right twice a day <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could dry your eyes <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> It could be easy <eos> If I could split my heart right into three <eos> For you, for her, for me <eos> What's the point in having part of a heart <eos> When the rest is left to bleed? <eos> But maybe some <eos> Will be better than none <eos> And I wish that I <eos> Could split it into three <eos> I wish I could love you <eos> Like I'm supposed to <eos> I wish I could split my heart <eos> For me, for her, for you <eos> For me, for her, for you <eos> 
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there <eos> The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air <eos> It’s hard <eos> Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round <eos> It’s funny how things never change in this old town <eos> So far from the stars <eos> And I want to tell you everything <eos> The words I never got to say the first time around <eos> And I remember everything <eos> From when we were the children playing in this fairground <eos> Wish I was there with you now <eos> If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> I saw that you moved on with someone new <eos> In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you <eos> It’s so hard <eos> So hard <eos> And I want to tell you everything <eos> The words I never got to say the first time around <eos> And I remember everything <eos> From when we were the children playing in this fairground <eos> Wish I was there with you now <eos> Because if the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> You still make me nervous when you walk in the room <eos> Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> And I know that it’s wrong <eos> That I can’t move on <eos> But there’s something about you <eos> If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you <eos> Drive highways and byways to be there with you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> You still make me nervous when you walk in the room <eos> Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you <eos> Over and over the only truth <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> Everything comes back to you <eos> 
Lay your love on mine <eos> Lay your love on mine <eos> Let your safety fall <eos> Let your safety fall <eos> Lay your pride on the line <eos> Lay your pride on the line <eos> No one's keeping score <eos> No one's keeping you away from me <eos> Only fear and doubt can be the downfall <eos> It's our enemy <eos> Who are you trying to blame? <eos> It's no one's fault <eos> Cause inside of me <eos> I love you to the core <eos> If you leap inside the corners of my mind <eos> Somersault into my emotions <eos> I'm a river till you take the dive <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Keep your lips on mine <eos> Keep your lips on mine <eos> Steady to the shore <eos> Steady to the shore <eos> Crash into the lies <eos> Crash into the lies <eos> The truth will keep us warm <eos> The truth will keep you away from me <eos> Only fear and doubt can be the downfall <eos> It's our enemy <eos> Who are you trying to blame? <eos> It's no one's fault <eos> Cause inside of me <eos> I love you to the core <eos> If you leap inside the corners of my mind <eos> Somersault into my emotions <eos> I'm a river till you take the dive <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> Ocean <eos> 
Wise men say <eos> Only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Shall I stay? <eos> Would it be a sin? <eos> If I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Like a river flows <eos> Surely to the sea <eos> Darling, so it goes <eos> Some things are meant to be <eos> So take my hand <eos> Take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> 
My cousin is in Colombia <eos> Hunting down the rebels <eos> Over fields of bright and shiny coca <eos> Over the jungle floor <eos> One-handing a 32 <eos> He says: "bring her down low now, I'm ready to go." <eos> "I hunt kids in camouflage <eos> Rain down bullets in flight, white light <eos> Barefoot boys run for your lives." <eos> But you can't be nice <eos> You put your gun to their head <eos> And you pull back the pin <eos> And you can't be good <eos> My friend is based in Afghanistan <eos> He goes from cave to cave and pulls the trigger <eos> At the first sight of a man <eos> It's total anarchy <eos> Shooting tracer bullets at night <eos> A high and holy patrol into poppy fields <eos> But you can't be good <eos> You hold up the bloody knife <eos> And let it shine in the sun <eos> You gotta be everywhere <eos> I'm a guard in Guantanamo <eos> I bring the prisoners in <eos> The hoods come off and torture slowly begins <eos> The screams I've overheard <eos> It'd fuck up a weaker man <eos> But I'm cold, I'm so untouchable <eos> And you can't be nice <eos> I got a flak jacket <eos> On my soul with me tonight <eos> And you can't be good <eos> 
1, 2, 3, 4, …, 2, 3, 4 <eos> A multitude of Flashes, we all have a Peter Parker story <eos> Like Jonah, it's a delivering of love and mercy <eos> To a J.J.J. institutionalizing society <eos> A multitude of Flashes, we all know a Darker Parker story <eos> We all have thoughts, we define who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can raise the bar <eos> We all have thoughts, redefine who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can <eos> It's hard to be a pacifist when you want to pass a fist <eos> Through the white teeth supporting a history of supremacy <eos> Doesn't help acting out the same derogatory tendencies <eos> With great power comes great responsibility <eos> We all have thoughts, we define who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can raise the bar <eos> We all have thoughts, redefine who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can <eos> All have thoughts, we define who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can raise the bar <eos> We all have thoughts, redefine who we are <eos> Believe it or not, we can <eos> Hello, my name is Darker Parker <eos> I fear I may die a martyr, I foster <eos> For apparently words have no meaning  <eos> So words I am hearing will never damage me <eos> That's a lie but it's true <eos> A contradictory use <eos> On a few words often stemmed from physical abuse <eos> Though verbal, I am emotionally obtuse <eos> (1, 2, 3, 4) <eos> In danger of proving entertainment right <eos> Acting off anger though I'm not the stereotype <eos> And voices of several are trying to get my head leveled <eos> "Darker Parker, don't you dare get blinded by the Devil” <eos> Though I may be a little, I use the sense I have left <eos> To handle a taboo of King events like I'm Daredevil <eos> Yet I'm back on my back like a spider <eos> Man my legs won't seem to stand <eos> For this isn't surreal, it's surely real <eos> What's the appeal of trying to appeal? <eos> Speaking this when you don't want to hear it <eos> It's what we have in common, is that not how I feel? <eos> With a migraine of thoughts, can't comprehend so far <eos> Bodies ignited with anger, to cope I've been raising this bar <eos> The Peter Parkers are tuckered from the others <eos> Peter Parkers, don’t lose your closest colors <eos> With a migraine of thoughts, can't comprehend so far <eos> Bodies ignited with anger, to cope I've been raising this bar <eos> The Peter Parkers are tuckered from the others <eos> Peter Parkers, don’t lose your closest colors <eos> 1, 2, 3, 4 <eos>

I'm selfish at loving <eos> And rushing into nothing <eos> I'm usually distant <eos> But damn you feel like home <eos> I'm mostly systematic, real dramatic, hard to please, and in control <eos> But what you doing to me is <eos> Calculated, misbehaving, just my kind of switching role <eos> You got me hooked on a feeling <eos> And I can't wait to let you in this time <eos> It's not like me to hit you back alright <eos> But it's you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> Ooh <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> And I can't wait to let you in this time <eos> It's not like me to hit you back alright <eos> But it's you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> Ooh <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> And I can't wait to let you in this time <eos> It's not like me to hit you back alright <eos> But it's you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> Ooh <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos> I just wanna be with you <eos>

She speaks in acronym <eos> Been sighing at the top of her lungs <eos> She's so convincing when she laughs and leads it on <eos> And I've been rinsing off <eos> All the colors of a love <eos> That I picked up when I was certain that I'd never come undone <eos> And I don't love her <eos> But with this manufactured sentimental buffer <eos> She really compliments my stubborn side and silence that I keep <eos> Until I'm drunk as hell and all the strings come out <eos> What it's always been about <eos> Can't she tell? <eos> I was tied up trying to tie off loose ends <eos> And pulling on a pretty long thread <eos> When I should've known better <eos> I had to try hard not to make promises <eos> It left me with a question on the conscious <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> It left me with a question on the conscious <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> It was a long time coming <eos> Still not long enough <eos> But reticent as ever she watched me come undone <eos> And I don't love her <eos> With this manufactured, sentimental buffer <eos> She really compliments my stubborn side and silence that I keep <eos> Until I'm drunk as hell and all the strings come out <eos> What it's always been about <eos> Can't she tell? <eos> I was tied up trying to tie off loose ends <eos> And pulling on a pretty long thread <eos> When I should've known better <eos> I had to try hard not to make promises <eos> It left me with a question on the conscious <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos> It left me with a question on the conscious <eos> Out of luck and out of context <eos>

My story goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on <eos> I can’t recall the power <eos> I need to retrieve it from my bones to find the page I’m on <eos> So I’ll sit down and watch the flowers <eos> My story goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on <eos> I can’t recall the power <eos> I need to retrieve it from my bones to find the page I'm on <eos> So I’ll sit down and watch the flowers <eos>

You must've come from out of the blue <eos> No other color would do <eos> We watched the clouds move all around <eos> Uncovering feelings unfound <eos> And I can't imagine when <eos> I can't imagine why I'd ever wanna leave you, dear <eos> If we stay right here <eos> We wouldn't have to worry about anything <eos> But the morning came and stole you right <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Your eyes are full of yellows and greens <eos> They turn into water and fall from your cheeks <eos> Now we're going deep into the dark <eos> And it's hard to tell where we are <eos> And I can't imagine when <eos> I can't imagine why I’d ever wanna leave you, dear <eos> If we stay right here <eos> We wouldn't have to worry about anything <eos> But the morning fades and so do you <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Ooh, what a lovely day for loving you <eos> Ooh, what a lovely day for loving you <eos> Love, oh <eos> The sunset, it bled orange and red <eos> In a perfect explosion behind your head <eos> While we're looking up, somehow we forget <eos> That even the best days will end <eos> Now I can't remember when <eos> I can't remember why you packed your bags and left me here <eos> It's been a whole year <eos> Since we said we'd never find somebody new <eos> Now I hardly ever talk to you <eos> But today, I stopped and thought of you <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out of the blue <eos> Out, out of the blue <eos>

Don't ask me <eos> What you know is true <eos> Don't have to tell you <eos> I love your precious heart <eos> Oh, I, I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never tear us apart <eos> We could live, yeah <eos> For a thousand years <eos> But if I hurt you <eos> I'd make wine from your tears <eos> I told you <eos> We could fly <eos> 'Cause we all have wings <eos> But some of us don't know why <eos> I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, ever tear us apart, ooh <eos> I, I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> And two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, ever <eos> I, I was standing <eos> And you were there, yeah <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, oh, ever, ever <eos> I was standing <eos> And you were there <eos> And two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, they could never, they could never, never <eos> 
Know you're coming from a bad place <eos> Honey, I was there just yesterday <eos> So I know the time it's gonna take <eos> For you to feel like you again <eos> Wonder if you're seeing colours yet <eos> And if your spirit needs a tourniquet <eos> 'Cause if it does I can hold you tight enough <eos> Help you forget 'em for a minute, love <eos> I know you got a heart of gold <eos> You wear it like a mourning robe <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope <eos> We can climb this burning rope <eos> And I'll be here if you need me <eos> If you don't, just know <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope <eos> There was something about last night <eos> Maybe it was just the moonlight <eos> Oh, dancing through your window pane <eos> We were lit up like a birthday cake <eos> I want a banner flown across the sky <eos> Spelling out, honey, I <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope <eos> We can climb this burning rope <eos> And I'll be there if you need me <eos> If you don't, just know <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope <eos> I want a banner flown across the sky <eos> Spelling out honey, I <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope' <eos> We can climb this burning rope <eos> And I'll be here if you need me <eos> If you don't, just know <eos> I've got a high hope <eos> I've got a high, high, high <eos> I've got a high, high, high, high hope <eos> 
If you're lookin' for somebody who <eos> Will love you through the night <eos> And be there in the morning with <eos> The same look in their eyes <eos> If you're lookin' for somebody who <eos> Will listen to your thoughts <eos> And understand the way you feel <eos> With no words at all <eos> If you need appreciation <eos> Without compensation <eos> Someone to give you what you need <eos> If you're looking for some magic <eos> That will not end tragic <eos> Darling all I ask is you consider me <eos> Consider me <eos> Consider me <eos> Consider me <eos> Won't you consider me? <eos> Consider me <eos> Consider me <eos> Consider me <eos> Won't you consider me? <eos> If you're looking for somebody who <eos> Don't judge you from your past <eos> And focuses on only things <eos> That help to make it last <eos> If you're looking for somebody who <eos> Will put up with your shit <eos> Can fight fire with fire <eos> Without burning you a bit <eos> Oh, if you want real attraction <eos> Beyond this skin we fashion <eos> Someone to set your spirit free <eos> Someone that you're obsessed with <eos> And that you feel blessed with <eos> Baby, all I ask is you consider me <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Won't you consider me? <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Consider me (Won't you consider me?) <eos> Won't you consider me? <eos> Baby don't delay it <eos> I'ma find a way <eos> To give you everything <eos> If you consider me <eos> At any time of day <eos> I'll be there right away <eos> Swear it on my grave <eos> If you consider me <eos> Won't you consider me? <eos> 
Just when I felt like giving up <eos> That I shouldn't try to save it now <eos> Easier lost outside of us <eos> That's not what I find this time around <eos> Every night outside my window, I pretend to catch the moon <eos> It reminds me that there's always something more for me to prove <eos> I'm just waiting for the moment when you tell me that it's true <eos> I'm just waiting on a moment for you <eos> To tell me how you feel <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> So give me something real <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> It's you <eos> Standing alone at 25 <eos> I barely recognize my own blue eyes <eos> I should've known, we'd make it right <eos> I'm coming back this time to a different life <eos> Where the lights outside my window flicker brighter than the moon <eos> Like a car chase in the valley, baby, it's just me and you <eos> Where we're living in the moment, when you tell me that it's true <eos> Now I'm right here in this moment with you <eos> So tell me how you feel <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> Just give me something real <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> It's you <eos> So tell me how you feel <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> Just give me something real <eos> Always known for me, it's you <eos> It's you <eos> 
I won't talk about the weather <eos> Not with you, we're not together <eos> 'Cause even when the sky is gray, I'm feeling blue <eos> And though the winds are always changin' <eos> And the clouds are rearrangin' <eos> A part of me will always be in love with you <eos> There's a fire in LA <eos> And since you moved there back in May <eos> I wonder, should I call to see if you're alright? <eos> Yeah, you're a million miles away <eos> But I still think of you each day <eos> And hope the weather doesn't keep you cold at night <eos> So, I won't talk about the weather <eos> No, I won't talk about the weather <eos> I won't talk about the weather <eos> Not with you, we're not together <eos> 'Cause even when the sky is gray, I'm feeling blue <eos> And though the winds are always changin' <eos> And the clouds are rearrangin' <eos> A part of me will always be in love with you <eos> So, I won't talk about the weather <eos> No, I won't talk about the weather <eos> I won't talk about the weather <eos> Not with you, we're not together <eos> And it's hard to say if we will ever be <eos> But I'll admit my greatest fear is that the air will never clear <eos> So I just wish that we could talk like you and me <eos> No, I won't talk about the weather <eos> Not with you, we're not together <eos> But I wonder if we're ever really through <eos> 'Cause if we're talking about whether <eos> You and I should be together <eos> Oh, I know I'll always be in love with you <eos> Oh, yes I know I'll always be in love with you <eos> 
I love you like coffee in the morning <eos> Flowers in the evening <eos> Ohh but we won’t let it die <eos> No, no <eos> We won’t let it die, no <eos> I love you like coffee in the morning <eos> Flowers in the evening <eos> Ohh but we won’t let it die <eos> No, no <eos> We won’t let it die, no <eos> Short sighted on a cloudy day <eos> I was riding my bike oh, as fast as I can <eos> But don't pull my hair, don't pull my leg <eos> I’m just try’n to play around <eos> So excited I am proud to say <eos> That the world is an oyster and I am ok <eos> But don't pull my hair, don't pull my leg <eos> I’m just try’n to play around <eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm <eos> I love you like coffee in the morning <eos> Flowers in the evening <eos> Ohh but we won’t let it die <eos> Noo <eos> We won’t let it die, no <eos> I love you like… <eos> Flowers in the evening <eos> Ohh but we won’t let it die <eos> No, no <eos> We won’t let it die, no <eos> I love you like coffee in the morning <eos> Flowers in the evening <eos> Ohh but we won’t let it die <eos> No , no <eos> We won’t let it die, no <eos> You used to come to my room at midnight <eos> Cos I couldn’t sleep right, I couldn't sleep right <eos> You used to come to my room at midnight <eos> Cos I couldn’t sleep right, I couldn't sleep right <eos> You used to come to my room at midnight <eos> Cos I couldn’t sleep right, I couldn't sleep right <eos> You used to come to my room at midnight <eos> Cos I couldn’t sleep right, I couldn't sleep right <eos> You used to come to my room at midnight <eos> Cos I couldn’t sleep right, I couldn't sleep right <eos> 
You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Oh, oh you said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Did you want me at home more? <eos> Was I runnin' around more than you liked, me leavin' you? <eos> Did you want more alone time? <eos> Was I callin' you up every night when I needed you? <eos> Times that I was tired and selfish <eos> I don't know why I did it, I couldn't help it <eos> But you know that I've tried <eos> Now I keep on askin', could I? <eos> Could I? <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Oh-oh you said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> Memories twist the light <eos> I know you're thinkin' tonight about the things I did right <eos> But seein' you so happy now <eos> Has got me thinkin' about all the things I did wrong <eos> Times that I was quiet and distant <eos> I don't know why I didn't tell you what I meant <eos> But you know that I've tried <eos> Now I keep on askin', could I? <eos> Could I? <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> There must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> You said I, I didn't do anythin' wrong <eos> But there must have been somethin' I could've done better <eos> 
If I could take back those days <eos> You know I’d be running, not a question <eos> If you had stayed <eos> You’d see I’ve been tryin', I’ve been tryin' <eos> I wanted to stay <eos> But baby I’m done fightin', I’m just tired of <eos> Feeling this way <eos> Baby, I was tryin', I was tryin' <eos> We can’t go back <eos> It don’t work like that at all <eos> No, we can’t go back <eos> It don’t work like that at all <eos> Baby, take a look where we are <eos> Somehow so far <eos> Lookin' like we’re back at the start <eos> Worlds apart <eos> Separate hearts <eos> Baby, take a look where we are <eos> Somehow so far <eos> Lookin' like we’re back at the start <eos> Worlds apart <eos> Separate hearts <eos> Day by day <eos> I used to pray <eos> Good Lord, come and take away <eos> The memories of you and me <eos> If you and me were meant to be <eos> Then why’s it all just make believe? <eos> Make believe <eos> I’m dreamin' of something I shouldn’t be doing <eos> With someone that I should be far from <eos> But all of this just ain’t easy <eos> Been thinking of something we could’ve been doing <eos> If we had a different outcome <eos> But maybe this is how it’s supposed to be <eos> We can’t go back <eos> It don’t work like that at all <eos> No, we can’t go back <eos> It don’t work like that at all <eos> Baby, take a look where we are (Baby, take a look) <eos> Somehow so far <eos> Lookin' like we’re back at the start <eos> Worlds apart <eos> Separate hearts <eos> Baby, take a look where we are (Baby, take a look) <eos> Somehow so far <eos> Lookin' like we’re back at the start <eos> Worlds apart <eos> Separate hearts <eos> 
I've been holding my breath <eos> I've been counting to 10 <eos> Over something you said <eos> I've been holding back tears <eos> While you're throwing back beers <eos> I'm alone in my bed <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that loves you <eos> Better than I do, darling, I know <eos> 'Cause you remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> Feels like a lifetime <eos> Just tryna get by <eos> While we're dying inside <eos> I've done a lot of things wrong <eos> Loving you being one <eos> But I can't move on (Oh, I) <eos> You know I, I'm afraid of change <eos> Guess that's why we stay the same <eos> So tell me to leave <eos> I'll pack my bags, get on the road <eos> Find someone that gives you <eos> All of the things I could not know <eos> 'Cause I keep fighting all the way <eos> I let you down so I could stay <eos> If you want me to leave <eos> Then tell me to leave and, baby, I'll go <eos> And, baby, I'll go <eos> You remind me every day <eos> I'm not enough, but I still stay <eos> 
Don't you let me, don’t you let me down <eos> I'm not a player, I don't mess around <eos> You seem nice I kinda like your smile <eos> Do you drink tea, can you stay awhile <eos> Someone told me that you’re kinda sweet <eos> I'm not a sucker for that kinda thing <eos> But when you ordered lemon-ginger tea <eos> That was the moment that changed everything <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got a feeling <eos> You and me, me and you <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got a feeling <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> You and me we go together like honey and tea <eos> (1, 2, 3) <eos> Girls like flowers, clever poetry <eos> That old adage doesn't work on me (sorry) <eos> But conversation and a cup of tea <eos> Boy, you had me at philosophy <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got a feeling <eos> You and me, me and you <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got a feeling <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> You and me we go together like <eos> Honey, you're my honey, and we like to drink tea <eos> From the cafe in the library <eos> Make it a venti and a caffeine free <eos> Won't you be my baby and stay with me <eos> Honey, you're my honey, and we like to drink tea <eos> From the cafe in the library <eos> Make it a venti and a caffeine free <eos> Grab a quiet table and we'll study chemistry <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got a feeling <eos> You and me, me and you <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> I gotta, I gotta, I got feeling <eos> Me and you, you and me <eos> You and me we go together like honey and tea <eos> 
One day you're here <eos> And the next, you're gone <eos> And it's killing me to say this <eos> Will we stay or will we go? <eos> I'm sick of all this <eos> Back and forth and on and on <eos> Feels like I'm the only one who cares <eos> Sick of wasting time with you <eos> But I know I can't be through <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos> Can we go back to the start <eos> When I kiss your neck <eos> And you hold me in your arms <eos> Lets just forget all the ways this could go wrong <eos> Lets get to loving baby <eos> Won't you love me baby? <eos> I'm sick of all this <eos> Back and forth and on and on <eos> Feels like I'm the only one who cares <eos> Sick of wasting time with you <eos> But I know I can't be through <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Ooh I don't wanna walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> Walk away <eos> And I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Ooh and I wish I could just walk away <eos> And I know the reasons I shouldn't stay <eos> Then I look in your eyes and it makes me wanna see what we could be <eos> If I give into you and you give into me <eos> 
I was wrong I know <eos> Am I the one to blame <eos> I found another home <eos> Heard her calling out my name <eos> Tell me if I go too far <eos> Will I become the lonesome lone star <eos> Tell me if I go too far <eos> Would I ever find my way back <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I ever see home again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I ever feel love again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> I love the Summer rain <eos> But I miss Libby's face <eos> I love the London streets <eos> But I miss the Texas highways <eos> And tell me if I go too far <eos> Would I become the lonesome lone star <eos> Tell me if I go too far <eos> Would I ever find my way back <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I ever see home again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I ever feel love again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> No matter where I lay my head <eos> You know where my heart remains <eos> No matter where I lay my head <eos> You know, you know, you know <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I see home again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Would I feel love again <eos> I wonder if I stay <eos> Now would that be my journey's end <eos> 
I still find your hair in my bed <eos> In my clothes, in my mouth <eos> In my nose, oh, who knows? <eos> If you'll still be there when <eos> It's all said and done <eos> Or if I'll just find less from now on <eos> Every time I wonder <eos> How I'd carry on without you <eos> I'm runnin' out of real estate <eos> Tryna make all the right moves <eos> I don't wanna hesitate <eos> I would bet the house on you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> I still have no windows <eos> In my room or my halls <eos> I was hoping I could look through yours <eos> Sitting in a chair next to your front door <eos> As I watch you do your makeup on the floor <eos> Every time I wonder <eos> How I'd carry on without you <eos> I'm runnin' out of real estate <eos> Tryna make all the right moves <eos> I don't wanna hesitate <eos> I would bet the house on you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> You <eos> I'm runnin' out of real estate <eos> Tryna make all the right moves <eos> I don't wanna hesitate <eos> I would bet the house on you <eos> I'm runnin' out of real estate <eos> Tryna make all the right moves <eos> I don't wanna hesitate <eos> I would bet the house on you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> You <eos> You <eos> 
Everything was so much sweeter <eos> With you by my side <eos> Even the strongest coffee wasn’t as bitter <eos> And everything was just right <eos> But some way, some how <eos> We just weren’t smart enough to figure out <eos> And now you’re right here <eos> Wedding vows <eos> Still I believe that there’s a start out there for you and me <eos> If it was the only way I could ever get another chance <eos> I’d start my life all over again <eos> I can’t remember my life <eos> Before I fell in love with you <eos> I couldn’t forget the little things <eos> Even if I wanted to <eos> Do you regret the day that we met <eos> And you said <eos> We could be best friends <eos> But some way, some how <eos> We just weren’t smart enough to figure out <eos> And now I’m packed and moving out <eos> Now it’s hard to believe that there’s a start out there for you and me <eos> If it was the only way I could ever get another chance <eos> I’d start my life all over <eos> Everything was so much sweeter <eos> With you by my side <eos> Even the strongest coffee wasn’t as bitter <eos> And everything was just right <eos>

Is it the rain out the window <eos> Makin' me feel anxious <eos> They say the weather can change ya <eos> But I don't ever feel like this <eos> Already 500 paces <eos> I'm diggin lines in the floor <eos> But I swear I don't think about you, no <eos> It ain't somethin' I usually do when I'm alone <eos> I don't sit around thinkin' it through, no <eos> But then again maybe I do <eos> Maybe I do <eos> I'm 'bout to storm out the front door <eos> Cause I ain't gonna drown here <eos> Don't understand where you came from <eos> And why I'm wishing that you were here <eos> I don't ever feel like this <eos> Should I blame it on the rain <eos> 'Cause I swear i don't <eos> I swear i don't think about you, no <eos> It ain't something I usually do when i'm alone <eos> I don't sit around thinkin' it through, no <eos> But then again maybe I do <eos> Then again maybe I do <eos> I think about you when I'm lonely <eos> And wanting to be be with you only <eos> But that's me being honest <eos> And I don't wanna be honest <eos> I swear I don't think about you <eos> I swear I don't think about you <eos> The memories keep coming <eos> With the rain on the front lawn <eos> They hit me through the painted glass <eos> Seeing straight into the past <eos> But I don't think about you <eos> Girl I swear <eos> I swear I don't think about you, no <eos> It ain't somethin I usually do when I'm alone <eos> I don't sit around thinkin' it through, no <eos> But then again maybe I do <eos> Then again maybe I do <eos> I think about you when I'm lonely <eos> And wanting to be with you only <eos> But that's me being honest <eos> And I don't wanna be honest <eos> I think about you when I'm lonely <eos> And wanting to be with you only <eos> But that's me being honest <eos> And I don't wanna be honest <eos> I swear I don't think about you <eos> I swear I don't think about you <eos> 
When we're all alone and the night has falled <eos> And lost in what each other needs <eos> When the silence echoes our nervous hearts <eos> And all is just the way we feel <eos> I can't hide it, shouldn't fight <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And loose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> You  shy away, you was afraid <eos> To give into something so real <eos> Allow desire to rule your head <eos> Get lost in what we feel <eos> You can't hide it shouldn't fight it <eos> Go with instinct why deny it <eos> You are all I ever wanted <eos> So let's run free <eos> And lose ourselves in love <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooohh <eos> We've never been here before <eos> So were gonna take our time <eos> Ooooh <eos> 
I tiptoed in the room <eos> I know you got to have your rest <eos> She says, "Come lay beside me <eos> I been waitin' since you left" <eos> She's sweet to me <eos> Must be the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> The first time that I saw you <eos> Mmm, you took my breath away <eos> I might not get to Heaven <eos> But I walked with the angels that day <eos> She takes me by the hand <eos> I am the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> Some may have their riches <eos> Some may have their worldly things <eos> As long as I have you <eos> I'll treasure each and every day <eos> Just take me by the hand <eos> I am the luckiest man alive <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> Did I tell you, baby <eos> You are the joy of my life? <eos> 
Don't waste your life behind that guitar <eos> You may get gone, but you won't get far <eos> You're not the first, you won't be the last <eos> And you can tell us all about it when you come crawling back <eos> That road you're on, just winds and winds <eos> You're spinning your wheels and wasting you're time <eos> But when the lights come up <eos> And I hear the band <eos> And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am <eos> I hear the crowd <eos> I look around <eos> And I can't find an empty chair <eos> Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere <eos> I get these calls, out on the road <eos> Heard your song on my radio <eos> We always said you'd make it big <eos> And I tell all my friends, I knew you back when <eos> So don't forget all us little folks <eos> And when you crash and burn <eos> Remember we told you so <eos> And then the lights come up <eos> And I hear the band <eos> And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am <eos> I hear the crowd <eos> I look around <eos> And I can't find one empty chair <eos> Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere <eos> I need to thank my daddy <eos> For that first set of strings <eos> And all those folks who swore I'd never be anything <eos> It took a whole lot of yes I wills and I don't care <eos> A whole lot of basement dives and county fairs <eos> To this show right now and y'all sure look good out there <eos> Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere <eos> Not bad for a girl goin' nowhere <eos> 
Water towers are made for hearts and names <eos> Friday nights are made for football games <eos> Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in <eos> Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin' <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash <eos> Second dates are made for goin' fast <eos> Early curfews are made for sneakin' past <eos> 2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Like a ship without a sea <eos> Or a song without a melody <eos> I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do <eos> 'Cause I was made for you <eos> Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?" <eos> Open roads are made for holdin' hands and <eos> Laid back seats are made for young love <eos> Two pink lines are made for growin' up <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Like a ship without a sea <eos> Or a song without a melody <eos> I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do <eos> 'Cause I was made for you <eos> Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet <eos> My two arms are made for where you sleep <eos> Sky was made for the moon and stars <eos> You were made to steal my heart <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> 
You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair <eos> Tellin' me how well you used to dance <eos> The western wind will come again <eos> And make you feel like you did <eos> When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance <eos> Said his life took most of you <eos> Gave you twice and the day was through <eos> You said it all turned out awfully fair <eos> So tell me tales of all the times and all the seasons you got by <eos> Breathin' in that cold November air <eos> No one was there <eos> No one was there <eos> When no one was there <eos> Two kids 'bout 23, when the sun sets you'll never see <eos> You were yellin' "Supper" from the yard <eos> And they grew old and sailed away <eos> Call you on phones from far away <eos> Wrote you novels on postcards <eos> And all you ever wanted was to see your children fly <eos> Maybe one day they're stars <eos> But there ain't no leavin' this small town this evenin' <eos> You can't even drive your own car <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Dear Mama, how's it goin'? <eos> Was the weather fair last week? <eos> Dear Mama, they were wonderful <eos> All the sights you'll never see <eos> And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms <eos> Tell you what it means <eos> You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats <eos> And make him mean something <eos> Tell us what you wanted to, and all we did, we needed you <eos> Your dreams were too small to care <eos> But I'm always reminded, if you look hard you'll find it <eos> Memory gives warmth to right here <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Through November air <eos> Dear Mama, how's it goin'? <eos> Was the weather fair last week? <eos> Dear Mama, they were wonderful <eos> All the sights you'll never see <eos> And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms <eos> Tell you what it means <eos> You could take a worthless poor boy from the flats <eos> And make him mean something <eos> You remember sittin' there one rainy night in a well-used chair <eos> Tellin' me how well you used to dance <eos> The western wind will come again <eos> And make you feel like you did <eos> When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
Trying to back off, trying to lay low <eos> Giving you time to read the stars <eos> Trying to wait for <eos> Something you don't know <eos> To show you where you are <eos> Where you are <eos> Where you are <eos> Where you are <eos> It's been so long now <eos> I know I should forget you <eos> But I ought to let it lie <eos> But I'm bound to wonder all about you <eos> No matter how I try <eos> There you are <eos> There you are <eos> There you are <eos> First a knock and then a crash <eos> And a staggering conviction <eos> That I might not catch up <eos> Like all the colors running down a portrait <eos> And now it looks nothing the one I fell in love with <eos> I thought I could write you, write down on a story <eos> When all the clear lines blurred <eos> I still want you to show up <eos> Hope you'll just roll through <eos> After all these years without a word <eos> Without a word <eos> Without a word <eos> Without a word <eos> 
I guess before I met you <eos> I didn't know better <eos> But you swept in out of nowhere <eos> And I thought I’d never go there <eos> And you set the bar <eos> For this stubborn heart <eos> And when you met my family <eos> Everybody knew that you had me wrapped <eos> I ain't ever loved no one like that <eos> And when I said I loved you <eos> I didn't care if you said it back <eos> I ain’t ever loved no one like that <eos> If you'd have just kept walking <eos> And we never got to talking <eos> I could go on existing <eos> Not knowing what I was missing <eos> But you set the bar <eos> For this stubborn heart <eos> When you met my family <eos> Everybody knew that you had me wrapped <eos> I ain't ever loved no one like that <eos> And when I said I loved you <eos> I didn't care if you said it back <eos> I ain't ever loved no one like that <eos> And maybe I'll love again <eos> Then again, maybe I won't <eos> Maybe you feel the same <eos> Maybe you don't <eos> How would I know? <eos> When you met my family <eos> Everybody knew that you had me wrapped <eos> I ain’t ever loved no one like that <eos> And when I said I loved you <eos> I didn’t care if you said it back <eos> I ain't ever loved no one like that <eos> 
Put on your old black dress <eos> And grab your dancing shoes <eos> Head out to the old bar Rose <eos> And we'll dance away our blues <eos> Spent all week waiting <eos> Now my mind's on you <eos> Hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> I'm so tired of the nine to five <eos> Weighing down on my soul <eos> Let's get out all of this uptown life <eos> And head out on the country road <eos> Forget about all the things that <eos> We can't make right <eos> Put on a little Emmylou <eos> And we'll dance into the night <eos> Singing, hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> I said, hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> Come on <eos> All we need is time, honey <eos> No, no, all we need is time <eos> Honey, I  <eos> Don't run from the love <eos> Sit on the front porch <eos> Kick off your shoes <eos> We don't need nowhere to go <eos> We don't need a tune <eos> In a world <eos> That gets lost in making plans <eos> Just be my woman <eos> Yeah, and I will be your man <eos> Yeah <eos> All we need is time, alright <eos> Yeah, yeah, all we need is time <eos> Hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> I said, hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> Singing, hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> I said, hold my loving arms <eos> My loving arms are for you <eos> Put on your old black dress <eos> And grab your dancing shoes <eos> Head out to the old bar Rose <eos> And we'll dance away our blues <eos> 
Hey I was just wondering if anyone was sitting here <eos> And if not, would it be okay if someone bought you a beer <eos> Let's say that someone wanted to dance <eos> Would he have any snowballin' hell of a chance <eos> To get you out on the floor before this slow song ends <eos> Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend <eos> He ain't ever been any good at laying it all out on the line <eos> I swear down deep, believe me girl, he's a really good guy <eos> If you can find it in your heart just to cut him some slack <eos> He'd be johnny-on-the-spot here in two seconds flat <eos> Yeah, he's holding his breath, come on give him a second with you <eos> Yeah what do you say <eos> It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful <eos> What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life <eos> He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool <eos> Just one drink would sure mean a lot to him <eos> Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend <eos> Let's say this friend of mine went and messed up real bad <eos> And he'd do anything in this world, girl, to get you back <eos> Hey what kind of sorry would it take for a man to erase his worst mistake <eos> And would this even begin to make a dent <eos> Yeah what do you say <eos> It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful <eos> What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life <eos> He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool <eos> I don't mean to ramble on like this <eos> Hey I'm just asking for a friend <eos> Yeah what if I told you he hadn't slept in weeks <eos> He was standing right here in front of you instead of me <eos> Is there any way you could ever love him again <eos> Just asking for a friend <eos> 
One, two, three <eos> Hey, it's me <eos> I'm just wondering where you are? <eos> I woke up late <eos> I think the game's about to start <eos> You know where I'll be <eos> Just sitting here at home <eos> Let's go Tennessee <eos> Me again <eos> You won't believe what just went down <eos> Third and goal, a fake reverse end-around <eos> Even fooled the referee <eos> Just had to let you know <eos> It's 7-zip Tennessee <eos> And by the way I meant to say <eos> That I'm sorry 'bout last night <eos> I didn't mean to make you cry <eos> But did you really mean goodbye? <eos> I swear to God I'm gonna change <eos> Turn this fool I've been around <eos> Yeah, I believe in miracles <eos> 'Cause, hell, I'm watching one right now <eos> And, girl, you won't believe <eos> It's going into half <eos> Ten-nothing Tennessee <eos> We scored again <eos> That's all I called again to say <eos> "It got real close" <eos> But just like you we pulled away <eos> Almost out of reach <eos> But it ain't over yet <eos> Now hold on Tennessee <eos> I swear to God I'm gonna change <eos> Turn this fool I've been around <eos> Yeah, I believe in miracles <eos> 'Cause, hell, I'm watching one right now <eos> Girl, you won't believe <eos> Two minutes left <eos> Looking good Tennessee <eos> It should have been <eos> Another best day of my life <eos> But girl I feel <eos> Kinda like the Crimson Tide <eos> With time running out on me <eos> With no Hail Mary chance <eos> 20-10 Tennessee <eos> 
I've been high, I've been low <eos> I've been everywhere a soul can go <eos> I've seen the Northern Lights and Heaven too <eos> But I ain't ever seen anything like you <eos> If you ever need somebody down the road <eos> You should know <eos> I'd stand in any ticket line <eos> Any mountain I would climb <eos> Just to find my way to where you are <eos> I would swim across the sea <eos> I would cut down any tree <eos> Leave a trail through a forest in the dark <eos> Pave a path to get back to where you are <eos> And if you need a light to shine <eos> I'll buy you any star hanging in the sky <eos> Oh and if this world it breaks your heart <eos> Break mine in two and take the other part <eos> Well you know it already belongs to you <eos> And it's true <eos> I'd stand in any ticket line <eos> Any mountain I would climb <eos> Just to find my way to where you are <eos> I would swim across the sea <eos> I would cut down any tree <eos> Leave a trail through a forest in the dark <eos> Pave a path to get back to where you are <eos> Ooh, yeah, yeah <eos> To reach you I would never stop <eos> I'd keep searching for you 'round the clock <eos> I sing your praises everywhere I go <eos> You should know <eos> You should know <eos> I'd stand in any ticket line <eos> Any mountain I would climb <eos> Just to find my way to where you are <eos> I would swim across the sea <eos> I would cut down any tree <eos> Leave a trail through a forest in the dark <eos> Pave a path to get back to where you are <eos> Pave a path to get back to where you are <eos> 
In this autumn town where the leaves can fall <eos> On either side of the garden wall <eos> We laugh all night to keep the embers glowing <eos> Some are leaping free from their moving cars <eos> Stacking stones 'round their broken hearts <eos> Waving down any wind that might come blowing <eos> Mice move out when the field is cut <eos> Serpents curl when the sun comes up <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> Some get rain and some get snow <eos> Some want love and some want gold <eos> I just want to see you in the morning <eos> Dogs lay down in the evening heat <eos> Fish do worse when they leave the sea <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> In this autumn town where the lights can change <eos> Some get mercy and some get blame <eos> Some get lost when they feel the river flowing <eos> It's all holy smoke and the flame dies fast <eos> We hold our hats while the days fly past <eos> Cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going <eos> Fathers, Sons and Holy Ghosts <eos> All come back or they all come close <eos> Songbirds only end up where they're going <eos> Some get hard and some go home <eos> Some want flesh and some want bone <eos> I just want to see you in the morning <eos> Yeah, I just want to see you in the morning <eos> 
I'm a stone's throw from the mill <eos> And I'm a good walk to the river <eos> When my workin' day is over <eos> We'll go swim our cares away <eos> Put your toes down in the water <eos> And a smile across your face <eos> And tell me that you love me <eos> Lovely Lady May <eos> Now I ain't the sharpest chisel <eos> That your hands have ever held <eos> But darlin' I could love you well <eos> Til' the roll is called on high <eos> I've seen my share of trouble <eos> And I've held my weight in shame <eos> But I'm baptized in your name <eos> Lovely Lady May <eos> Lord the wind can leave you shiverin' <eos> As it waltzes o'er the leaves <eos> It's been rushin' through my timber <eos> Til' your love brought on the spring <eos> Now the mountains all are blushin' <eos> And they don't know what to say <eos> 'Cept a good long line of praises <eos> For my lovely Lady May <eos> Now I ain't the toughest hickory <eos> That your ax has ever fell <eos> But I'm a hickory just as well <eos> I'm a hickory all the same <eos> I came crashin' through the forest <eos> As you cut my roots away <eos> And I fell a good long ways <eos> For my lovely Lady May <eos> 
Maybe in ten years <eos> You'll call me on your telephone <eos> Wondering if I'm all alone <eos> Remember how we knew each other? <eos> In ten years, everyone's been down the line <eos> And we've all ended up fine <eos> I no longer know your number <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> We used to talk real slow <eos> About the things that no one knows <eos> I hate when people bring flowers <eos> Trapped in glass their final hour <eos> And life rolls, it's all so fast until it slows <eos> We cried that night in Carrboro <eos> Realized we were letting go <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> Used to love you like the world would end <eos> Used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> 
It was a crawdad spring and a grasshopper summer <eos> I had a dime store daddy and a paperback mother <eos> Sister had a boyfriend and brother was playing ball <eos> And I was raising myself, the last of them all <eos> So I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> There was a party going on with nobody home <eos> No one to mind me, or looking to find me <eos> I was outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> I was a California dreamer in a hot Texas town <eos> And I was too young to drive but I still got around <eos> Climbing out of windows just to get stoned <eos> Out there on the edge swimming alone <eos> But I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> I was always running away from home <eos> But on my side was my heart open wide <eos> I learned how to survive swimming alone <eos> Yeah <eos> I've had friends and lovers and so many others <eos> I've had a lot of good deals and plans that I broke <eos> Sometimes you get burned but that's how you learn <eos> When you're out there in the world swimming alone <eos> So I jumped in, closed my eyes <eos> Don't bother calling 'cause I won't pick up the phone <eos> Baby don't mind me, you know where to find me <eos> I'm outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> I'll be outside in the backyard swimming alone <eos> 
They didn't ever say where we were going <eos> We just climbed into the backseat <eos> Eyes wide open to the picture show outside <eos> I guess we really didn't understand it all <eos> I remember looking up at them in the front row <eos> Hands touched together almost out of sight <eos> It's been a long hard week but now the slow release <eos> Of a Sunday afternoon <eos> And we were only young but they were trying hard to reach us <eos> How was I to know that there was something so worth keepin'? <eos> 'Cause we were watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> Man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> The sun warms your soul just like an old friend <eos> Singing songs along that ribbon of a road <eos> And everyone you love is sitting there so close <eos> You're never thinking that you'd ever get old <eos> No, you'll never get old <eos> Just watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> And man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive, oh <eos> I never said where we were going <eos> I just helped them to the backseat <eos> Dad just laughed and said, "Son, don't drive too far <eos> Your mama gets pretty tired these days" <eos> After a few miles I guess they recognized some places <eos> And I listened as they reminisced <eos> About a world that they had always known and how it's changin' <eos> Probably never gonna be the same again <eos> I caught 'em in the mirror <eos> They were holding hands and smiling <eos> Looking younger than they'd been in years <eos> Oh, through all the years <eos> And they were watching the world through an open window <eos> Trees lined up like dominoes <eos> This old car could find its own way home <eos> It's the ordinary things that mean so much <eos> That's where I learned it all from them <eos> To fight, to love, to laugh again <eos> Man, I thought we were only wasting time <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> Out on a Sunday drive <eos> 
Through your window, by the water <eos> Can you see me, when the wind blows <eos> Through empty quarters <eos> You will never know <eos> 'cause you'd already know by now <eos> Ohhhh, ohhhh <eos> When your love grew, I was there too <eos> I should have told you <eos> I'm the only boy awake now <eos> Gazing at the stars, I dive into the blue and You <eos> Ohhhh, ohh ohh, ohhh <eos> I never had to walk like this before <eos> I never had to hide away <eos> I don't really want to talk like this no more <eos> I will walk until the night turns to day - and you <eos> Through your window, by the water <eos> Can you see me, when the wind blows <eos> Through empty quarters <eos> You will never know <eos> 'cause you'd already, you'd already know by now <eos> 
She wakes up in the mornin' <eos> Sleepin' in the bed I made <eos> Bound to get away I'd say <eos> I wake up in the mornin' <eos> Thinkin' of her again <eos> Did I ever make her day? <eos> Did I ever make her day? <eos> See I broke my mind in half <eos> Everybody even I know it <eos> And I'll talk to the papers <eos> And I'll drive back south <eos> But it'll probably work itself out <eos> It'll probably work itself out <eos> See you were someone I knew, <eos> Studied your face for years <eos> We know how it might have been <eos> So we made up some story <eos> That we gotta tell sometimes <eos> We don't ever quite get it right <eos> We don't wanna live some lie <eos> So I broke my mind in half <eos> And everybody even I know it <eos> And I'll talk to the papers <eos> And I'll drive back south <eos> But it'll probably work itself out <eos> It'll probably work itself out <eos> And we'll both catch colds come spring <eos> And there ain't no such thing as everything <eos> You got reservations and I got doubts <eos> And it'll probably work itself out <eos> It'll probably work itself out <eos> It'll probably work itself out <eos> It'll probably work itself out <eos> 
I know they say, "You can’t go home again" <eos> I just had to come back one last time <eos> Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam <eos> But these hand prints on the front steps are mine <eos> Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom <eos> Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar <eos> And I bet you didn't know under that live oak <eos> My favorite dog is buried in the yard <eos> I thought if I could touch this place or feel it <eos> This brokenness inside me might start healing <eos> Out here it’s like I'm someone else <eos> I thought that maybe I could find myself <eos> If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave <eos> Won't take nothing but a memory <eos> From the house that built me <eos> Mama cut out pictures of houses for years <eos> From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine <eos> Plans were drawn and concrete poured <eos> Nail by nail and board by board <eos> Daddy gave life to Mama's dream <eos> I thought if I could touch this place or feel it <eos> This brokenness inside me might start healing <eos> Out here it’s like I'm someone else <eos> I thought that maybe I could find myself <eos> If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave <eos> Won't take nothing but a memory <eos> From the house that built me <eos> You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can <eos> I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am <eos> I thought if I could touch this place or feel it <eos> This brokenness inside me might start healing <eos> Out here it’s like I'm someone else <eos> I thought that maybe I could find myself <eos> If I could walk around, I swear I'll leave <eos> Won't take nothing but a memory <eos> From the house that built me <eos> 
I guess a break is just a break until it's broken <eos> You're noticing that it's been so long <eos> I guess I'm learnin' for certain it wasn't worth it <eos> Deservin' this, yeah, it feels so wrong <eos> You took a shot at me, I took it pretty hard <eos> Sweepin' up a shattered broken heart <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> I guess I should've known better that I'd be better off <eos> But something had me holdin' on <eos> I guess this hanging and dangling left me strangling <eos> And trust me, that ain't somethin' you want <eos> Sometimes subliminal meanings can mean the literal <eos> You left me critical <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> You took a shot at me, I took it pretty hard <eos> Sweepin' up a shattered broken heart <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces for a reason <eos> Tryna find the silver lining and seeing <eos> Why does leavin' lead to bleedin'? <eos> Cut me deeper than the cracks in the ceiling <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' out them words can have a whole 'nother meaning <eos> Wasn't easy but I'm findin' that your heart can take a hell of a beating <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> Guess you really love me to pieces <eos> 
Me and Louise never had much luck <eos> Just a couple of kids with a lot of love <eos> Laid our fortunes on her daddy's old farm <eos> Didn't see how dirt could do such harm <eos> Seasons came and the seasons left <eos> The only thing that changed was the shape of her dress <eos> She said: you're a good man, you'll have my child <eos> You can't raise a living a thing on this cursëd old ground <eos> We laid a sheet on the piano keys <eos> Crying good lord, please, please <eos> Packed our things into the old farm car <eos> Wondering if it could take us very far <eos> And I said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> Out here on the borderline the sun sets low <eos> Like a couple of jackrabbits dancing in the morning snow <eos> Knew we'd make it, if we could just get out <eos> The only thing we saw was love in sow <eos> Miles came and the miles went <eos> Our hearts full - our money spent <eos> Somewhere outside El Paso my Louise cried out <eos> She took my arm - said, "It's time now" <eos> I prayed and waited all night <eos> Oh Louise, please, please <eos> I heard a new voice with the new day <eos> I thought back to what her Daddy used to say <eos> And he said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> Then me and Louise didn't go too far <eos> We named our boy for Louise's pa <eos> Found a plot of ground we could call our own <eos> We built a house - we built a home <eos> And we said <eos> Everything about it takes a little luck <eos> Gears rumble - and the left door's stuck <eos> It doesn't come with any guarantees <eos> But there's gas in the tank, Louise <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> But there's gas in the tank <eos> Louise <eos> 
I could've walked around the world a couple times <eos> I could've swam across the ocean and back again <eos> Made a wish on every star that Galileo drew <eos> For all the time I've wasted on you <eos> I could have downed a million beers in Mexico <eos> Counted every piece of gravel on a long county road <eos> Sailed that slow boat to China, right up to the moon <eos> For all the time I've wasted on you <eos> Time goes by and when it's gone, it's gone, and you realize <eos> Time just lies and you did not move on <eos> No, you just cried, you just cried <eos> I could've filled the Mississippi river with my tears <eos> No telling what I could have done with all these years <eos> I could've dug out the Grand Canyon with a spoon <eos> For all the time I've wasted on you <eos> Time goes by and when it's gone, it's gone, and you realize <eos> Time just lies and you did not move on <eos> No, you just cried, you just cried <eos> For everything I've lost, I'm not mad at love <eos> I'd even give it one more day if I thought it would be enough <eos> I could have served five life sentences for a crime I didn't do <eos> For all the time I've wasted on you <eos> 
In the hood <eos> There's no other place for me <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no place I'd rather be <eos> Ghetto rules are hard to understand <eos> It's tough to survive if you don't know a man <eos> Thug deep, ballin' through the urban sands <eos> Ridin' solo, wheels at my command <eos> It seems that ghetto dreams <eos> Are deep in my mind as they just beam <eos> I can see 'em in the distance like a light <eos> Making me do the thangs that I do, it's alright <eos> Stars down, ready for the sparkin' <eos> Playa' on the scene, and you know I'm ghetto walkin' <eos> I'm stompin', falling through a ghetto  <eos> Run up on my Glock, and you know it's ghetto talkin' <eos> All my homeboys, yeah they showin' much love <eos> Like it's comin' down, from above <eos> So I keep on pressin' with these ghetto dreams <eos> Ghetto beams, and ghetto things <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no other place for me <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no place I'd rather be <eos> I'm flippin', and I'm fallin, and I'm kickin' so real <eos> Everythang is chill, lick reveal <eos> It's amazing, matta fact, baller made <eos> As I kick back, doin' this thang every day <eos> But it's called... it's called R-A-P-P-I-N-G <eos> And all my boys feel me <eos> I ride with G's I grew up with <eos> And I ain't even trippin', it's a major lick <eos> Them boys are all about they paper, and all about they cash <eos> Movin' thangs quick, and movin' thangs fast <eos> In this concrete jungle, as we're bumpin' these woofers <eos> In six by nines, with the eight on this alpine <eos> Greater, later, left/right, faders <eos> System heard for miles, and you know we ain't no haters <eos> We stackin' paper every day <eos> Ballin', shot-callin', and killin' away <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no other place for me <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no place I'd rather be <eos> Ghetto rules had me mad, but never sad <eos> Planted in my head while I'm doin' our task <eos> Thinkin' to myself, as the tape rewinds <eos> A playa' gotta stay deep on his grind <eos> I'm scoopin' up, one of them G's <eos> We're bout to head downtown for a meetin' in the industry <eos> The game of fame, and everythang is so legit <eos> In this game we ain't gon' neva' quit <eos> My boy told me once "parlay and just play" <eos> In this thang that's real, for us to be made <eos> I dwell amongst tall buildings, a city slicker <eos> Keepin' it cool, so I'm blowin' up quicker <eos> I'm chillin' like that boy said to do <eos> Keepin' it cool, movin' with the ghetto rules <eos> And understand the ghetto wells <eos> The ghetto rules, and the ghetto tales <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no other place for me <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no place I'd rather be <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no other place for me <eos> In the hood <eos> There's no place I'd rather be <eos> 
Once you were my life and breath <eos> And you rode your free horse to death <eos> Oh you trifled around too much <eos> Then you lost your loving touch <eos> Now whose shoulder will you cry on <eos> You didn't love me all alone <eos> 'Cause you can't love and do me wrong <eos> I don't trust you no more <eos> So go knock on another's door <eos> And whose shoulder will you cry on <eos> Just let those hot tears burn your eyes <eos> They're just payments on the line <eos> That made a wreck of me <eos> From that chain I've been set free <eos> Now whose shoulder will you cry on <eos> You didn't love me all alone... <eos>

I’m going back to the farm <eos> Where the starry night skies roll on and on <eos> I’m going back to my ancestry <eos> Gonna find out a little more about what made me <eos> When Madeleine was 26 <eos> She was given a daisy chain made with love <eos> She kept that daisy chain in her jewelry box <eos> To this day the chain remains unbroken <eos> I’m going back to the southern shores <eos> Gonna run along my favourite beaches with my dog <eos> And I will miss you ‘til the day I die <eos> But I find comfort knowing I can see you in the sky <eos> I’m going back to the farm <eos> Where the brilliant sunrise wakes me from my sleep <eos> Knowing I still have a million miles to run <eos> And a million songs still to be sung <eos> I’m going back to the farm I tell ya <eos> Where the starry night skies roll on & on into November and all year <eos> Tonight we’re gonna sing songs of hope and joy <eos> And be thankful for what we’ve learned along the way <eos> And be thankful for what we’ve learned along the way <eos> The moon, the sun, the laughter and the tears <eos> We find comfort knowing you’ll always be near <eos> Each link in the chain holds strong and true <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos> The chain remains unbroken <eos>

Two jumps in a week, I bet you <eos> Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy <eos> Flying on your motorcycle <eos> Watching all the ground beneath you drop <eos> Kill yourself for recognition <eos> Kill yourself to never, ever stop <eos> You broke another mirror <eos> And you're turning into something you are not <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> Drying up in conversation <eos> You will be the one who cannot talk <eos> All your insides fall to pieces <eos> You just sit there wishing you could still make love <eos> They're the ones who'll hate you <eos> When you think you've got the world all sussed out <eos> They're the ones who'll spit at you <eos> And you'll be the one screaming out <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had <eos> The best thing that you've ever, ever had <eos> Yeah, it's the best thing that you've ever had <eos> The best thing you've had has gone away <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> Don't leave me high <eos> Don't leave me dry <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know wе weren't perfеct <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause you know I still love you, babe (Ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> 'Cause you know I still love you, babe (Ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Wise men say <eos> Only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Shall I stay? <eos> Would it be a sin? <eos> If I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Like a river flows <eos> Surely to the sea <eos> Darling, so it goes <eos> Some things are meant to be <eos> So take my hand <eos> Take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> 
Every breath you take <eos> Every move you make <eos> Every bond you break <eos> Every step you take <eos> I'll be watching you <eos> Every single day <eos> Every word you say <eos> Every game you play <eos> Every night you stay <eos> I'll be watching you <eos> Oh can't you see <eos> You belong to me <eos> My poor heart aches <eos> With every step you take <eos> Every move you make <eos> Every vow you break <eos> Every smile you fake <eos> Every claim you stake <eos> I'll be watching you <eos> Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace <eos> I dream at night I can only see your face <eos> I look around but it's you I can't replace <eos> I feel so cold and I long for your embrace <eos> I keep crying baby, baby, please <eos> Oh can't you see <eos> You belong to me <eos> My poor heart aches <eos> With every step you take <eos> Every move you make <eos> Every vow you break <eos> Every smile you fake <eos> Every claim you stake <eos> I'll be watching you <eos> Every move you make <eos> Every step you take <eos> I'll be watching you <eos> 
You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love <eos> I needed to lose you to love mе, yeah <eos> To love, love, yеah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos> 
When it's not always raining, there'll be days like this <eos> When there's no one complaining, there'll be days like this <eos> When everything falls into place like the flick of a switch <eos> Well my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't need to worry, there'll be days like this <eos> When no one's in a hurry, there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't get betrayed by that old Judas kiss <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't need an answer, there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't meet a chancer, there'll be days like this <eos> When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit, yeah <eos> Then I must remember there'll be days like this <eos> When everyone is up front and they're not playing tricks, yeah <eos> When you don't have no freeloaders out to get their kicks, yeah <eos> When it's nobody's business the way that you want to live <eos> I just have to remember there'll be days like this <eos> When no one steps on my dream, there'll be days like this <eos> When people understand what I mean, there'll be days like this <eos> When you ring out the changes of how everything is <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> 
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom <eos> Well, who am I to keep you down? <eos> It's only right that you should play the way you feel it <eos> But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness <eos> Like a heartbeat drives you mad <eos> In the stillness of remembering what you had <eos> And what you lost and what you had and what you lost <eos> Thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Say women they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know <eos> Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions <eos> I keep my visions to myself <eos> It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams <eos> And have you any dreams you'd like to sell? <eos> Dreams of loneliness <eos> It's like a heartbeat drives you mad <eos> In the stillness of remembering what you had <eos> And what you lost and what you had and what you lost <eos> Thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Women they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know <eos> And thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Say women they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know <eos> You will know, you'll know <eos> 
If I tell you, if I tell you now <eos> Will you keep on <eos> Will you keep on loving me? <eos> If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel <eos> Will you keep on bringing out the best in me? <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> And it never felt like this before <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> That is you <eos> There's a quiet storm <eos> And it never felt this hot before <eos> Giving me something that's taboo <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> You've got the biggest heart <eos> Sometimes I think you're just too good for me <eos> Every day is Christmas and every night is New Year's Eve <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> That's why I'm in love with you <eos> You give me the sweetest taboo <eos> Only the sweetest <eos> Only the sweetest <eos> 
Remember those walls I built <eos> Well, baby they're tumbling down <eos> And they didn't even put up a fight <eos> They didn't even make a sound <eos> I found a way to let you in <eos> But I never really had a doubt <eos> Standing in the light of your halo <eos> I got my angel now <eos> It's like I've been awakened <eos> Every rule I had you breakin' <eos> It's the risk that I'm takin' <eos> I ain't never gonna shut you out <eos> Everywhere I'm looking now <eos> I'm surrounded by your embrace <eos> Baby I can see your halo <eos> You know you're my saving grace <eos> You're everything I need and more <eos> It's written all over your face <eos> Baby I can see your halo <eos> Pray it won't fade away <eos> I can see your halo halo <eos> Hit me like a ray of sun <eos> Burning through my darkest night <eos> You're the only one that I want <eos> And I'm addicted to your light <eos> I swore I'd never fall again <eos> But this don't even feel like falling <eos> Gravity can't forget <eos> To pull me back to the ground again <eos> Feels like I've been awakened <eos> Every rule I had you breakin' <eos> The risk that I'm takin' <eos> I'm never gonna shut you out <eos> Everywhere I'm looking now <eos> I'm surrounded by your embrace <eos> Baby I can see your halo <eos> You know you're my saving grace <eos> You're everything I need and more <eos> It's written all over your face <eos> Baby I can feel your halo <eos> Pray it won't fade away <eos> Halo halo halo halo <eos> I can feel your halo <eos> I can see your halo <eos> I can feel your halo <eos> I can see your halo <eos> Halo <eos>

I took my love, took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain, and I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart rise above? <eos> Can I sail through the changing ocean tides? <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Yeah I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I've built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder, even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Yeah I'm getting older too <eos> I take my love, take it down <eos> Oh, climb a mountain and turn around <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> Oh, the landslide will bring it down <eos> 
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> When I met you <eos> I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around <eos> Into someone new <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> It's much too late to find <eos> You think you've changed your mind <eos> You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Oh-oh, mm <eos> Mm-mm-mm, mm <eos> I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> That much is true <eos> But even then I knew I'd find a much bettеr place <eos> With or without you <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't beliеve it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, oh-oh? <eos> Ooh <eos> 
Go and close the curtains <eos> 'Cause all we need is candlelight <eos> You and me and a bottle of wine <eos> To hold you tonight <eos> Well we know, I'm going away <eos> And how I wish, I wish it weren't so <eos> So take this wine and drink with me <eos> Let's delay our misery <eos> Save tonight <eos> And fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Save tonight <eos> And fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> There's a log on the fire <eos> And it burns like me for you <eos> Tomorrow comes with one desire <eos> To take me away, it's true <eos> It ain't easy to say goodbye <eos> Darling please don't start to cry <eos> 'Cause you know I've got to go <eos> And Lord I wish it wasn't so <eos> Save tonight <eos> Fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Save tonight <eos> Fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Tomorrow comes to take me away <eos> I wish that I, that I could stay <eos> Girl you know I've got to go <eos> And hell I wish it wasn't so <eos> Save tonight <eos> Fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Save tonight <eos> And fight the break of dawn <eos> Come tomorrow <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> Tomorrow I'll be gone <eos> 
Baby blue bandana drives by in a pickup truck <eos> Got a white stripe right down the side, tires on the mud <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> Stand up on my shoulders <eos> And tell me, darling, what can you see? <eos> Ten thousand holy rollers going to battle <eos> Cigarettes tucked up in their sleeves <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of lovе and I'll obey her evеry word <eos> We take our loving on the run quite seriously <eos> I'm wondering if she's got a gun hidden up her sleeve <eos> Now stand up on my shoulders <eos> And tell me, honey, what can you see? <eos> Ten thousand holy rollers <eos> Going to battle, plain white tees <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> She is an officer of love and I'll obey her every word <eos> Every word, every word, start a fire <eos> Baby blue, baby blue <eos> 
All this time I've been hanging on <eos> To an edge I caught when we both were young <eos> That the world I won wasn't near enough <eos> Always distant, always all <eos> In all that war, I'd forgotten how <eos> Many men might die for what I'd renounced <eos> I was staging life as a battleground <eos> No, I let that grasping fall <eos> May the last long year be forgiven <eos> All that war left within it <eos> I couldn't, though I'm beginning to <eos> And we've only made it together <eos> Feel some change in the weather <eos> I couldn't, though I'm beginning to <eos> And though it's all so uncertain, cold <eos> All the rafters cracked, all the copper sold <eos> There's a ration back in a manifold <eos> If you need it or forgot <eos> May the last long year be forgiven <eos> All that war left within it <eos> I couldn't, though I'm beginning to <eos> And we've only made it together <eos> Feel some change in the weather <eos> I couldn't, though I'm beginning to <eos> And somehow I see <eos> It's free <eos> And with love and hate in the balance <eos> One last way past the malice <eos> One warm day's all I really need <eos> And with love and hate in the balance <eos> One last way past the malice <eos> One warm day is all I really need <eos> 
Mountain of worry <eos> Mountain of song <eos> You ask how I'm doing <eos> Like you knew what was wrong <eos> Tell me just one time <eos> What I knew all along <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> If you don't call me <eos> I might lose my mind <eos> Can't keep concentrating <eos> On all the worry I find <eos> So just lend me your body <eos> I'll lend you mine <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> My eyelids are heavy <eos> My spirit is numb <eos> Don't know where I'm headed <eos> Don't know where I'm from <eos> I'm here just waiting <eos> For my day to come <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> 
Indecision poor decisions <eos> Led me to believe <eos> That you live and you learn <eos> Until you are your own worst enemy <eos> I cross my heart and I hope to die <eos> That she got something better <eos> Misery loves company <eos> We’re all in this together <eos> All has been said <eos> And all has been done <eos> We’re taking on the belt <eos> You ain’t the only one <eos> The easy way out <eos> It’s a dangerous path <eos> No one knows it like I do <eos> Beat the door down and shatter the glass <eos> But you better be sure what it leads to <eos> Or who it leads to <eos> The lash I felt from the Bible belt <eos> Brought me down on my knees <eos> When I thought I could stand on my own two feet <eos> My foreseen dreams are thundering <eos> And dangerous weather <eos> In my head how soon he did <eos> Soon feeling better <eos> All has been said <eos> And all has been done <eos> Taking on the belt <eos> You ain’t the only one <eos> The easy way out <eos> It’s a dangerous path <eos> No one knows it like I do <eos> Beat the door down and shatter the glass <eos> But you better be sure what it leads to <eos> Or who it leads to <eos> And the easy way out <eos> It’s a dangerous path <eos> No one knows it like I do <eos> When you beat the door down and shatter the glass <eos> But you better be sure what it leads to <eos> Or who it leads to <eos> What it leads to <eos> Or who it leads to <eos>

Whiskey, whiskey <eos> No ice in my whiskey, please <eos> The plane lurches <eos> My stomach flips and I <eos> Look to the cabin crew for <eos> Signs of concern <eos> But they don't give much away <eos> I am an Ulster man <eos> A goddamn liberal <eos> A man of reason <eos> Oh the little things we tell ourselves <eos> To give us back a <eos> Bit of meaning <eos> I mean God's been dead for a while <eos> So if there's nowhere for our <eos> Souls to go then <eos> I don't want to be so sober, so <eos> Whiskey, whiskey <eos> No ice in my whiskey please <eos> Wouldn't take a genius to <eos> Work it out <eos> I've had my fair share of <eos> Conversations with <eos> Twisted metal and <eos> Broken glass <eos> Well if lightings gonna strike me twice <eos> This time I'm gonna do it right <eos> Whiskey, whiskey <eos> No ice in my whiskey please <eos> Whiskey, whiskey <eos> No ice in my whiskey please <eos> I ain't gonna die sober <eos> The plane lurches <eos> My stomach flips and I <eos> Look to the cabin crew for <eos> Signs of concern <eos> 
How can I rearrange <eos> And put it on the page <eos> When the enemy's at the door <eos> And there's nothing you can do they've never seen before <eos> And everybody knows <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> I can see a fire from a mile away <eos> 'Cause nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> If I could reach you now <eos> I'd say that I am proud <eos> Of everything you've done <eos> And the wonderful man I know you have become <eos> 'Cause maybe you don't know <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> Tell me that you love me when you're miles away <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Loneliness is on the dawn <eos> Loving is a line <eos> I saw it on the sign <eos> It's a line to drag you in <eos> It's false advertising <eos> And no one wants to say <eos> Nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> Could I be the only one still waiting? <eos> I can wait some more <eos> Tell me what happens, will I be okay? <eos> I can see a fire from a mile away <eos> 'Cause nothing's gonna happen with your back against the door <eos> 
You give me a sign <eos> You give me a lift <eos> You take me home when I've done my shift <eos> You give me a loan <eos> When I'm stone cold broke <eos> Get me high, when I need a toke <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Times were tough <eos> We made it through <eos> We tasted the rough <eos> So let's save the spoon <eos> All the time I was hurtin' you <eos> Got to believe that I was hurtin' too <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Your the only one I can talk to <eos> The only one I can really read <eos> I know you give because you want to <eos> Don't you think it's time you learned to let yourself receive? <eos> Can make you smile <eos> Can make you sing <eos> Just wanna give back a lil bit of what you give me <eos> I could sing you a song <eos> Play you a tune <eos> I know its just a little thing but it's something I can do <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was a-born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> 
Danger danger <eos> I can read your mind <eos> Wouldn’t change it <eos> ‘Cus I fall this way <eos> And feels so right <eos> Yeah it all feels right <eos> I can’t believe that I would ever stand so close to you <eos> It doesn’t matter where this ends up, I ain’t leaving <eos> Know what I’m doing, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> I try to act like it ain’t ever gonna bother me <eos> But when you talk like that you make it feel so easy <eos> Know where I’m headed, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no, ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back oh I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos>

What am I waking for? <eos> Am I waiting for a sign <eos> That I'm brave enough to follow? <eos> Can I just fail enough to bail out? <eos> I'm in my Wednesday suit <eos> I'm just so sick of this commute <eos> Are they always speakin' to me? <eos> Only advertisers know me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> I'm in Belvеdere <eos> You said the air was crystal clеar <eos> I get attached to my surroundings <eos> Like they know everythin' about me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Or maybe I'm just falling apart <eos> How'd we get so far? <eos> Tryna make a better escape <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> 
"Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together" <eos> "I've got some real estate here in my bag" <eos> So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies <eos> And walked off to look for America <eos> "Kathy," I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburgh <eos> "Michigan seems like a dream to me now" <eos> It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw <eos> I've gone to look for America <eos> Laughing on the bus <eos> Playing games with the faces <eos> She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy <eos> I said "Be carеful his bowtie is really a camera" <eos> "Toss mе a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat" <eos> "We smoked the last one an hour ago" <eos> So I looked at the scenery and she read her magazine <eos> And the moon rose over an open field <eos> "Kathy, I'm lost," I said, though I knew she was sleeping <eos> I am empty and aching and I don't know why <eos> Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike <eos> They've all come to look for America <eos> All come to look for America <eos> All come to look for America <eos> All come to look for America <eos> 
The night sky had broken, the new year had spoken <eos> I was beside myself, I stood out in the cold <eos> In an empty parking lot, my breath was streaming hot <eos> I willed the car to start to bring me home to you <eos> Oh, lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Before I knew you, I lived in the rearview <eos> To wish back an image of myself I thought was true <eos> So now when colors fade and on that day of days <eos> I needed you to say it wasn't one to rue <eos> Oh, and lead me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Headlights and cold rain distorting the dark panes <eos> Wipers clicking and my thoughts they followed suit <eos> And I felt like Willy Loman, the mighty plans I'd spoken <eos> Guess they were illusions of a man who dreamed too big <eos> But I remember you dancing in autumn when we met <eos> You won't believe I saw it then so many years ago <eos> There was something about you I struggled to forget <eos> My blood was rushing down to you <eos> You were leadin’ me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leadin' me back from the darkness like you do <eos> Leading me back like a horse to water knowing I'd refuse <eos> 'Cause you're a wanderer too <eos> 
One spring mornin' <eos> Six years ago <eos> Felt the shadows <eos> Strangle hold <eos> In the hallway <eos> Hung up the phone <eos> I heard my mother <eos> Please come home <eos> Within my horror <eos> My spirit cold <eos> 'neath the violence <eos> The final blows <eos> Gathering comfort <eos> I do recall <eos> From the darkness <eos> Callin' forth <eos> I called for ya <eos> Chokin' on the white noise rushin' <eos> Howlin' from <eos> The great beyond <eos> I called for ya <eos> I recall the violence rainin' down <eos> I was shiverin' <eos> Stone cold <eos> With the sickenin' <eos> Waves of woe <eos> And the memories <eos> Hauntin' on <eos> I lost the key to all <eos> That ever was <eos> The sunlight struck me <eos> So cynical <eos> Seemed unjust <eos> Void of hope <eos> But there you were <eos> Your wings around me <eos> Found my heart lost <eos> And gave it warmth <eos> I called for ya <eos> Chokin' on the white noise rushin' <eos> Howlin' from <eos> The great beyond <eos> I called for ya <eos> I recall the violence rainin' down <eos> All around <eos> Cherry <eos> Blossom wild and free <eos> Can you still remember <eos> Sister to me <eos> Cherry <eos> Our wild cherry tree <eos> I still remember you and me <eos> Cherry <eos> Blossom wild and free <eos> Forever remember <eos> Sister to me <eos> Cherry <eos> Wild river to the sea <eos> I still remember you and me <eos> 
Hey, everything must always start again. That's how it goes my little Mickey Finn <eos> They rob you and they kick you when you're out like a light, I know it's happening <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> Give me something, Bloomsday's coming, open up the doors and have a goddamn beer <eos> Ring the baker, the butcher, the charioteer, the palm readers in Salem, the engineer <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> So are you a socialite, do you buy candles to pricey now to light? <eos> Or are you an Okie from Okmulgee just making due with wax and pride? <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> And everybody's wondering where their little light is <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> The little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine <eos> 
All day at the bookstore <eos> Curled up in the same chair <eos> I was lost <eos> In what we shared <eos> On a train to Fleetwood <eos> It began to rain <eos> No one came <eos> To get me <eos> From the station <eos> I walked home alone <eos> With your song in my head <eos> Finally understanding something <eos> In what you said <eos> In the moment <eos> How the rain smelled <eos> And I know now <eos> And I know now <eos> And I know now <eos> 
Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring <eos> Oh but I know love as a fading thing <eos> Just as fickle as a feather in a stream <eos> See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me <eos> It put its face up to my face so I could see <eos> Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me <eos> Into something I am not recognizing <eos> You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ <eos> I will not open myself up this way again <eos> I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand <eos> I will not lay like this for days now upon end <eos> You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand <eos> To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand <eos> You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’ <eos> I will not open myself up this way again <eos> You see the moon is bright in that treetop night <eos> I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light <eos> Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white <eos> And we race out on the desert plains all night <eos> See honey, I am not some broken thing <eos> I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee <eos> No my heart is gold and my feet are light <eos> And I am racing out on the desert plains all night <eos> Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring <eos> Oh but I know love as a caging thing <eos> Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream <eos> Ah and all you folks, you come to see <eos> You just stand there in the glass looking at me <eos> But my heart is wild and my bones are steam <eos> And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free <eos> 
This is the first day the flowers wilt and fold <eos> Nothing reverses, aridity takes hold <eos> The call could've been answered <eos> The wall would’ve been questioned <eos> The fall should've been prevented <eos> But it is what it is <eos> This is the first day our friend is free from pain <eos> Voyaging on while the rest of us remain <eos> The call could've been answered <eos> The wall would’ve been questioned <eos> The fall should've been prevented <eos> But it is what it is <eos> 
I'm tired of losing <eos> I used to win every night of the week <eos> Yeah, back when sex and amphetamines <eos> Were the staples of our childhood physique <eos> You used to tell me we'd turn into something <eos> Oh, you said life was much better than this <eos> Yeah, but the closest I've come to perfection <eos> Is when you turned around to steal a kiss <eos> But you never trusted tomorrow <eos> Yeah, baby is that anyway to live your life? <eos> Well, you love this heart and this six string, girl <eos> But they've been outta tune (yeah) for some time <eos> Well, you said, "Oh, I love so many women <eos> There's so many women, love, driving me wild" <eos> Yeah, they say you get lost in complexion <eos> And the structure of a well-placed smile <eos> But luckily you, oh, you never smile <eos> Yeah, you, oh you, you never smile <eos> And it looks better that way to me <eos> Sometimes it does <eos> But, you know, you never trusted tomorrow <eos> Oh, baby, that's just a problem of mine <eos> Yeah, I've been thrown around by some bad ones, girl <eos> Oh, and a good one was a new thing this time <eos> Yeah, but you showed me that I couldn't be farther <eos> From the truth of the problem at hand <eos> Oh, I could never say "baby, tomorrow <eos> Oh, I'll be right there!" <eos> I'ma be your man <eos> Yeah, oh, I'll be your man <eos> 
Late at night when I feel alone <eos> I cry in darkness and scream into the unknown <eos> 'Cause she's never coming back <eos> No, she's never coming back <eos> Body in water for days and days <eos> Hopes for a safe return, my hope's in vain <eos> 'Cause she's never coming back <eos> No, she's never coming back <eos> When I was seventeen, I pretended not to care <eos> Stayed numb for years to escape despair <eos> When your soul dies, you just can't hide it <eos> Everyone can tell <eos> Oh, Lord, will I ever feel right again? <eos> Tried so hard to be an automaton <eos> Body of steel and wire circuits for my backbone <eos> 'Cause she's never coming back <eos> No, she's never coming back <eos> Wild turkey in the car seat <eos> The bottle's empty, I hope it gave her some relief <eos> 'Cause she's never coming back <eos> No, she's never coming back <eos> When I was seventeen, I pretended not to care <eos> Stayed numb for years to escape despair <eos> When your soul dies, you just can't hide it <eos> Everyone can tell <eos> Oh, Lord, will I ever feel— <eos> When I was seventeen, I pretended not to care <eos> Stayed numb for years to escape despair <eos> When your soul dies, you just can't hide it <eos> Everyone can tell <eos> Oh, Lord, will I ever feel, will I ever feel <eos> Right again? <eos> 
I wish I had been ready for you <eos> We could have done all those things that lovers do <eos> But I wouldn’t let you in, you had to wait in the dark <eos> All of those years wondering when it would start <eos> So new, having something to save <eos> But the shade grows large in the face of the wave <eos> I stick my head in the sand, I hope it all goes away <eos> Like I always have <eos> I wish I had been ready for you <eos> I love your heart and your shaking body too <eos> But I wouldn’t let you in, you had to wait in the dark <eos> All of those years wondering when it would start <eos> So I’m getting used to dropping my pride <eos> I lay it all out for you, I put it all on the line <eos> I take the right way now, instead of the wrong way out <eos> For the first time <eos> Nothing was a mistake, you’ll learn to love along the way <eos> You’ll bend or you will break, either way a life is made <eos> But you cannot fall through the cracks, we’ll be there to bring you back <eos> Hold you ‘til the dark is through, in the way old lovers do <eos> (ooooooohhhhh) <eos> 
I am waiting for this book to get good <eos> I do not have your patience <eos> I am driving up to Chicago <eos> I’m getting weird looks at gas stations <eos> I did not bring a winter coat <eos> I do not have your foresight <eos> A holistic practitioner told me once <eos> It’s why I will not live a long life <eos> I am trying to remember where I gave up <eos> If it was not in Iowa <eos> Iowa <eos> Somewhere in the middle of the middle of the Great Plains I saw <eos> A little girl waving her hand out of the window of a car <eos> Saying goodbye to her ma <eos> Iowa <eos> Where the tall grass prairie used to ripple like the ocean in the breeze <eos> And the hummingbirds still suckled from the flowers in the trees <eos> It’d bring you to your knees <eos> I can imagine my whole life <eos> Sweet and never-ending <eos> In every house I float by <eos> But they’d never let me blend in <eos> I called a taxi in Des Moines <eos> I met him at the corner <eos> When I asked about his army coat <eos> He said he would not tell a foreigner <eos> Iowa <eos> Somewhere in the middle of the middle of the Great Plains I saw <eos> A little girl waving her hand out of the window of a car <eos> Saying goodbye to her ma <eos> Iowa <eos> Where the tall grass prairie used to ripple like the ocean in the breeze <eos> And the hummingbirds still suckled from the flowers in the trees <eos> It’d bring you to your knees <eos> I am waiting for this book to get good <eos> And you won’t meet me halfway <eos> So I’m driving up to Chicago <eos> I am sorry to keep you waiting <eos> 
You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest <eos> Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain <eos> Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean <eos> You fill up my senses, come fill me again <eos> Come let me love you, let me give my life to you <eos> Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms <eos> Let me lay down beside you, let me always be with you <eos> Come let me love you, come love me again <eos> (Let me give my life to you <eos> Come let me love you, come love me again) <eos> You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest <eos> Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain <eos> Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean <eos> You fill up my senses, come fill me again <eos> 
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside <eos> I'm not one of those who can easily hide <eos> I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did <eos> I'd buy a big house where we both could live <eos> If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no <eos> Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show <eos> I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do <eos> My gift is my song, and this one's for you <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss <eos> Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross <eos> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song <eos> It's for people like you that keep it turned on <eos> So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do <eos> You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue <eos> Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean <eos> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> 
Morning has broken like the first morning <eos> Blackbird has spoken like the first bird <eos> Praise for the singing, praise for the morning <eos> Praise for them springing fresh from the Word <eos> Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from Heaven <eos> Like the first dew fall on the first grass <eos> Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden <eos> Sprung in completeness where His feet pass <eos> Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning <eos> Born of the One Light Eden saw play <eos> Praise with elation, praise every morning <eos> God's recreation of the new day <eos> Morning has broken like the first morning <eos> Blackbird has spoken like the first bird <eos> Praise for the singing, praise for the morning <eos> Praise for them springing fresh from the Word <eos> 
It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear <eos> She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair <eos> And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight" <eos> We go to a party and everyone turns to see <eos> This beautiful lady that's walking around with me <eos> And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight" <eos> I feel wonderful because I see <eos> The love light in your eyes <eos> And the wonder of it all <eos> Is that you just don't realize how much I love you <eos> It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head <eos> So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed <eos> And then I tell her, as I turn out the light <eos> I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight <eos> Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight" <eos> 
Don't go changin' <eos> To try and please me <eos> You never let me down before, mmm <eos> Don't imagine <eos> You're too familiar <eos> And I don't see you anymore <eos> I would not leave you <eos> In times of trouble <eos> We never could have come this far, mmm <eos> I took the good times <eos> I'll take the bad times <eos> I'll take you just the way you are <eos> Don't go tryin' <eos> Some new fashion <eos> Don't change the color of your hair, mmm mmm <eos> You always have my <eos> Unspoken passion <eos> Although I might not seem to care <eos> I don't want clever <eos> Conversation <eos> I never want to work that hard <eos> I just want someone <eos> That I can talk to <eos> I want you just the way you are <eos> I need to know that you will always be <eos> The same old someone that I knew <eos> Ahh, what will it take 'til you believe in me <eos> The way that I believe in you <eos> I said I love you <eos> And that's forever <eos> And this I promise from the heart, mmm mmm <eos> I couldn't love you <eos> Any better <eos> I love you just the way you are <eos> Right! <eos> 3:04 - 3:29 <eos> I don't want clever <eos> Conversation <eos> I never want to work that hard, mmm-mm <eos> I just want someone <eos> That I can talk to <eos> I want you just the way you are, ohh <eos> 
You are the sunshine of my life <eos> That's why I'll always be around <eos> You are the apple of my eye <eos> Forever you'll stay in my heart <eos> I feel like this is the beginning <eos> Though I've loved you for a million years <eos> And if I thought our love was ending <eos> I'd find myself drowning in my own tears <eos> You are the sunshine of my life <eos> That's why I'll always be around <eos> You are the apple of my eye <eos> Forever you'll stay in my heart <eos> You must have known that I was lonely <eos> Because you came to my rescue <eos> And I know that this must be heaven <eos> How could so much love be inside of you? <eos> You are the sunshine of my life <eos> That's why I'll always be around <eos> You are the apple of my eye <eos> Forever you'll stay in my heart <eos> 
You sheltered me from harm <eos> Kept me warm, kept me warm <eos> You gave my life to me <eos> Set me free, set me free <eos> The finest years I ever knew <eos> Were all the years I had with you <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> You taught me how to love <eos> What it's of, what it's of <eos> You never said too much <eos> But still you showed the way <eos> And I knew from watching you <eos> Nobody else could ever know <eos> The part of me that can't let go <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> Is there someone you know <eos> You're loving them so <eos> But taking them all for granted? <eos> You may lose them one day <eos> Someone takes them away <eos> And they don't hear the words <eos> You long to say <eos> And I would give anything I own <eos> Would give up my life, my heart, my home <eos> I would give everything I own <eos> Just to have you back again <eos> Just to touch you once again <eos> 
When you're down and troubled <eos> And you need a helping hand <eos> And nothing, whoa, nothing is going right <eos> Close your eyes and think of me <eos> And soon I will be there <eos> To brighten up even your darkest nights <eos> You just call out my name <eos> And you know wherever I am <eos> I'll come running oh yeah baby <eos> To see you again <eos> Winter, spring, summer, or fall <eos> All you got to do is call <eos> And I'll be there, yeah, yeah yeah <eos> You've got a friend <eos> If the sky above you <eos> Should turn dark and full of clouds <eos> And that old north wind <eos> Should begin to blow <eos> Keep your head together <eos> And call my name out loud now <eos> Soon I be knocking <eos> Upon your door <eos> You just call out my name <eos> And you know where ever I am <eos> I'll come running oh yes I will <eos> To see you again <eos> Winter, spring, summer, or fall yeah <eos> All you got to do is call <eos> And I'll be there, yeah yeah yeah <eos> Hey, ain't it good to know <eos> That you've got a friend? <eos> People can be so cold <eos> They'll hurt you <eos> And desert you <eos> Well, they'll take your soul <eos> If you let them <eos> Oh yeah, but don't you let them <eos> You just call out my name <eos> And you know wherever I am <eos> I'll come running <eos> To see you again, oh baby don't you know 'bout <eos> Winter, spring, summer, or fall <eos> Ain't now all you got to do is call <eos> Lord, I'll be there, yes I will <eos> You've got a friend <eos> You've got a friend, yes <eos> Ain't it good to know <eos> You've got a friend <eos> Ain't it good to know <eos> You've got a friend <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> You've got a friend <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos> 
When you're weary <eos> Feeling small <eos> When tears are in your eyes <eos> I will dry them all <eos> I'm on your side <eos> When times get rough <eos> And friends just can't be found <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> When you're down and out <eos> When you're on the street <eos> When evening falls so hard <eos> I will comfort you <eos> I'll take your part <eos> When darkness comes <eos> And pain is all around <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will lay me down <eos> Sail on Silver Girl <eos> Sail on by <eos> Your time has come to shine <eos> All your dreams are on their way <eos> See how they shine, oh <eos> If you need a friend <eos> I'm sailing right behind <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will ease your mind <eos> Like a bridge over troubled water <eos> I will ease your mind <eos> 
Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane <eos> I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain <eos> Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye <eos> God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been <eos> And Daniel says it's the best place he's ever seen <eos> Oh, and he should know, he's been there enough <eos> Lord, I miss Daniel <eos> Oh, I miss him so much <eos> Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me <eos> Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? <eos> Your eyes have died, but you see more than I <eos> Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky <eos> Oh, Daniel, my brother, you are older than me <eos> Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal? <eos> Your eyes have died, but you see more than I <eos> Daniel, you're a star in the face of the sky <eos> Daniel is travelin' tonight on a plane <eos> I can see the red taillights headin' for Spain <eos> Oh, and I can see Daniel wavin' goodbye <eos> God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> Oh God, it looks like Daniel <eos> Must be the clouds in my eyes <eos> 
Hey, have you ever tried <eos> Really reaching out for the other side? <eos> I may be climbing on rainbows <eos> But baby, here goes <eos> Dreams <eos> They're for those who sleep <eos> Life is for us to keep <eos> And if you're wondering <eos> What this all is leading to <eos> I want to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos> No, you don't know me well <eos> And every little thing <eos> Only time will tell <eos> If you believe the things that I do <eos> And we'll see it through <eos> Life can be short or long <eos> Love can be right or wrong <eos> And if I chose the one <eos> I'd like to help me through <eos> I'd like to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos> 2:03 - 2:26 <eos> Baby, you know that <eos> Dreams <eos> They're for those who sleep <eos> Life, it's for us to keep <eos> And if I chose the one <eos> I'd like to help me through <eos> I'd like to make it with you <eos> I really think that we could make it, girl <eos>

Strolling along country roads with my baby <eos> It starts to rain, it begins to pour <eos> Without an umbrella, we're soaked to the skin <eos> I feel a shiver run up my spine <eos> I feel the warmth of her hand in mine <eos> Oh, I hear laughter in the rain <eos> Walking hand in hand with the one I love <eos> Oh, how I love the rainy days <eos> And the happy way I feel inside <eos> After a while we run under a tree (after a while) <eos> I turn to her and she kisses me <eos> There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat) <eos> Softly she breathes and I close my eyes <eos> Sharing our love under stormy skies <eos> Oh, I hear laughter in the rain <eos> Walking hand in hand with the one I love <eos> Oh, how I love the rainy days <eos> And the happy way I feel inside <eos> I feel the warmth of her hand in mine <eos> Oh, I hear laughter in the rain <eos> Walking hand in hand with the one I love <eos> Oh, how I love the rainy days <eos> And the happy way I feel inside <eos> Oh, I hear laughter in the rain <eos> Walking hand in hand with the one I love <eos> Oh, how I love the rainy days <eos> And the happy way I feel inside <eos> 
I can't light no more of your darkness <eos> All my pictures seem to fade to black and white <eos> I'm growin' tired, and time stands still before me <eos> Frozen here on the ladder of my life <eos> Too late to save myself from falling <eos> I took a chance and changed your way of life <eos> But you misread my meanin' when I met you <eos> Closed the door and left me blinded by the light <eos> Don't let the sun go down on me <eos> Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see <eos> I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free <eos> But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me <eos> I can't find, oh, the right romantic line <eos> But see me once and see the way I feel <eos> Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm <eos> But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal <eos> Don't let the sun go down on me <eos> Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see <eos> I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free <eos> But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me <eos> Don't let the sun go down on me <eos> Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see <eos> I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, yeah <eos> But losin' everything is like the sun goin' down on me <eos> 
Let's be chameleons <eos> You're a sister, I needed more <eos> Once the war fought the storm <eos> And I thought the light would beam <eos> Write the words on the shore <eos> Give a signal when we breathe <eos> Let the wheels take the fall <eos> The wheels take the fall <eos> When I'm cold, you shake <eos> I see you in the morning in a myriad ways <eos> I'm all for yours to keep <eos> I'm all for yours to keep <eos>

I can dance, I can shake <eos> I can move and I can break <eos> Like a fire in the soul <eos> I can burn, I can grow <eos> I can come, I can go <eos> I can rock and I can roll <eos> Down the road, start again <eos> But I know that it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> That it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> I can play, I can sing <eos> I can tell you anything <eos> I can run, I can move <eos> To the dark side of the moon <eos> I can cross over seas <eos> I can ride along the breeze <eos> I can be, I can do <eos> What I want <eos> But it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> Yeah it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> I can scream, I can fight <eos> I can read and I can write <eos> I can love, I can leave <eos> I can get down on my knees <eos> I can go, I can stay <eos> In the night or in the day <eos> I can lie, I can dream <eos> I can try <eos> But it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> Yeah it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> Like a storm in your brain <eos> Like thunder in your veins <eos> I can feel, I can touch <eos> I can tell when it’s too much <eos> I can call out your name <eos> I can try and keep the flame <eos> Burning bright, hold a hand <eos> To the night <eos> But it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> And it ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> We ain’t nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> Nothing <eos> (Without your love, without your love) <eos> 
Mountain of worry <eos> Mountain of song <eos> You ask how I'm doing <eos> Like you knew what was wrong <eos> Tell me just one time <eos> What I knew all along <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> If you don't call me <eos> I might lose my mind <eos> Can't keep concentrating <eos> On all the worry I find <eos> So just lend me your body <eos> I'll lend you mine <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> My eyelids are heavy <eos> My spirit is numb <eos> Don't know where I'm headed <eos> Don't know where I'm from <eos> I'm here just waiting <eos> For my day to come <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> I'm on your side <eos> On your side <eos> Long blue light <eos> 
And, darling <eos> Is there a cure for this hunger? <eos> A terrible curse to be under <eos> I'll be sleeping with that <eos> And it's no small thing <eos> You'll smoke me out in your own ways <eos> And chase me around until morning <eos> And follow me back <eos> And, lovely <eos> You're tearing me down with your cheekbones <eos> They're warm, but they hit me like sharp stones <eos> When you pull away <eos> Now I walk slow <eos> And wander the streets in the morning <eos> I still smell your scent like a warning <eos> When the wind blows <eos> Oh, when the wind blows <eos> So, leave me <eos> When you're sleeping alone in the basement <eos> And my parents are home, but I'm vacant <eos> And I'm watching the news <eos> Because I'm slow now <eos> I'm young, but I feel like an old man <eos> The tar in my lungs and these cold hands <eos> They held onto you <eos> No, keep me <eos> Inside of your mind when you're aching <eos> Lord, 'cause for now, we're mistaken <eos> In thinking we fit <eos> But I'll stay steady, but nights are a-blazing and heavy <eos> Alone in my room and I'm ready <eos> To rest for a while <eos> Oh, to rest for a while <eos> Oh, but I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind, honey, I don't mind <eos> Oh, but I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> And I don't mind it <eos> I'll wait and I'll listen <eos> I don't mind it <eos> And see through to the kitchen <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I'm not taking it back <eos> Oh, and I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it <eos> I don't mind it, I <eos> Oh, honey, I don't mind <eos> 
Sometimes your life feels like a broken rollercoaster <eos> A thousand useless moving parts <eos> Sometimes you spend your nights <eos> Too scared of getting closer <eos> Hiding out in the back seat of your car <eos> You tell yourself it's raining <eos> The clouds are in your head <eos> You tell yourself it's better <eos> To jump before you fall again <eos> Before you lose it all again <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't lеt it bring you to your knees <eos> Look up <eos> Mondays aren't always bright <eos> Some days, you lose thе fight <eos> But life can be beautiful if you let it be <eos> Tomorrow keeps taunting you <eos> With all kinds of mystery <eos> It's a blank page for your poetry <eos> If you let it be <eos> So don't tell yourself it's raining <eos> The clouds are in your head <eos> You tell yourself it's better <eos> To jump before you fall again <eos> Before you lose it all again <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, yeah <eos> Look up <eos> Look up <eos> Hold on <eos> Look up <eos> Sometimes your life feels like a broken rollercoaster <eos> A thousand useless moving parts <eos> Look up <eos> Do you see the sunlight? <eos> Look up <eos> There's flowers in your hair <eos> Hold on <eos> 'Cause somebody loves you <eos> You know trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, yeah <eos> Look up <eos> Trouble's always gonna be there <eos> Look up <eos> Don't let it bring you to your knees, look up <eos> 
Yes, I know what it means <eos> To have six years behind us in waiting <eos> Not but a shadow remains <eos> Well, you took what was left worth taking <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow, too <eos> I have to get out of this place <eos> But instead I'm at peace with staying <eos> Oh, we both come and go as we please <eos> Well, I guess that’s the game that we're playing <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow, too <eos> I came to my senses alone <eos> In the bed where my eyes was lying <eos> It was there that my thoughts turned to you <eos> Waylaid by the light that was dying <eos> And was backed by the wails of a siren <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> If you could grow too <eos> This is only begun <eos> I, I do not know <eos> If I could just <eos> Grow into love with you <eos> 
Ghost dog running down the rocky edges <eos> To the churned up under of the ocean bed <eos> No, I’m not running and I never have been <eos> To the true blue bottom where the light ends <eos> Old growth forest and the sun in your veins <eos> At the daily dawning of a green new age <eos> No, no one changes with a snap in the air <eos> And you can’t repurpose what was never there <eos> Restart in the old familiar dark we’re swimming through <eos> Long view into the blue <eos> It’s day I think, but we might be underwater <eos> In a sea creature’s dream, in a dreaming drink <eos> No, there’s no time for the end over end <eos> And everything to do before dying again <eos> Long view into the blue <eos> Ghost dog running <eos> To the churned up under of the ocean bed <eos> No, I’m not running <eos> To the true blue bottom where the light ends <eos> Restart in the old familiar dark we’re swimming through <eos> Long view into the blue <eos> 
You give me a sign <eos> You give me a lift <eos> You take me home when I've done my shift <eos> You give me a loan <eos> When I'm stone cold broke <eos> Get me high, when I need a toke <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Times were tough <eos> We made it through <eos> We tasted the rough <eos> So let's save the spoon <eos> All the time I was hurtin' you <eos> Got to believe that I was hurtin' too <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> Your the only one I can talk to <eos> The only one I can really read <eos> I know you give because you want to <eos> Don't you think it's time you learned to let yourself receive? <eos> Can make you smile <eos> Can make you sing <eos> Just wanna give back a lil bit of what you give me <eos> I could sing you a song <eos> Play you a tune <eos> I know its just a little thing but it's something I can do <eos> I was born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was a-born to love <eos> I was born to <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> I was born <eos> To love you <eos> 
Down in the valley, the first of May <eos> Gatherin' flowers, both fresh and gay <eos> Gatherin' flowers, both red and blue <eos> How little thought of what, what love could do <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> I put my hand in, into the bush <eos> Finding the sweetest, sweetest rose <eos> I pricked my finger deep to the line <eos> And left the sweetest rose, sweetest rose behind <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> Saw a ship sailin' on the big blue sea <eos> She sailed as deep as, deep as she could be <eos> But not so deep in, in love as I am <eos> I cannot whether I, I sink or swim <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> Don't you break my heart <eos> Thousands and thousands all on this Earth <eos> 
A lonely mother gazing out of the window <eos> Staring at a son that she just can't touch <eos> If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side <eos> But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much <eos> But all the praying just ain't helping at all <eos> 'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble <eos> So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how <eos> Another body lying cold in the gutter <eos> Listen to me <eos> Don't go chasing waterfalls <eos> Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're usеd to <eos> I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all <eos> But I think you're moving too fast <eos> Littlе precious has a natural obsession for temptation <eos> But he just can't see <eos> She gives him loving that his body can't handle <eos> But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me" <eos> One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror <eos> But he doesn't recognize his own face <eos> His health is fading and he doesn't know why <eos> Three letters took him to his final resting place <eos> Y'all don't hear me <eos> Don't go chasing waterfalls <eos> Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to <eos> I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all <eos> But I think you're moving too fast <eos> Don't go chasing waterfalls <eos> Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to <eos> I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all <eos> But I think you're moving too fast <eos> Don't go chasing waterfalls <eos> Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to <eos> I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all <eos> But I think you're moving too fast <eos> Don't go chasing waterfalls <eos> Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to <eos> I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all <eos> But I think you're moving too fast <eos> 
What am I waking for? <eos> Am I waiting for a sign <eos> That I'm brave enough to follow? <eos> Can I just fail enough to bail out? <eos> I'm in my Wednesday suit <eos> I'm just so sick of this commute <eos> Are they always speakin' to me? <eos> Only advertisers know me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> I'm in Belvеdere <eos> You said the air was crystal clеar <eos> I get attached to my surroundings <eos> Like they know everythin' about me <eos> Maybe I'm just fallin' away <eos> Counting down the days <eos> Tryna make a better mistake <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Or maybe I'm just falling apart <eos> How'd we get so far? <eos> Tryna make a better escape <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call you when I land <eos> Don't think about the distance <eos> Do you understand <eos> Not everything is missin'? <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> Call me when you can <eos> Don't think about the future <eos> Maybe lend a hand <eos> 'Cause failure is a feature <eos> Oh, oh <eos> We're gonna figure it out <eos> 
In the summer of '07, I was sure I'd go to heaven <eos> But I was hedging my bets at VBS <eos> A preacher in a T-shirt told me I could be a leader <eos> Taught me how to build a fire and to spread the word <eos> In the evening, everybody went to worship and weep <eos> Hands above our heads, reaching for God <eos> Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed <eos> You were waiting for a revelation of your own <eos> Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut <eos> Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart <eos> Waiting to be tasted and ultimately wasted <eos> You were gonna win me over from the start <eos> Your poetry was so bad <eos> It took a lot to not laugh <eos> You say that I showed you the light <eos> But all it did in the end <eos> Was make the dark feel darker than before <eos> Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason <eos> Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason <eos> When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason <eos> You are not convinced the reason is a good one <eos> While you're going to sleep, your mind keeps you awake <eos> And it makes your heart beat fast and loud <eos> There's nothing you can do but the only thing you found <eos> Playing Slayer at full volume helps to drown it out <eos> Your poetry was so bad <eos> It took a lot to not laugh <eos> You say that I showed you the light <eos> But all it did in the end <eos> Was make the dark feel darker than before <eos> Dark feel darker than before <eos> Dark feel darker than before <eos> 
Was it going on behind my back? <eos> On second thought don't tell me that <eos> I don't need to know all the facts <eos> I just need to know <eos> Is there a price for doing well? <eos> Should I feel bad 'cause I can't tell? <eos> I felt guilty there for a spell <eos> But now I need to know <eos> Am I wasting my time? Ooh <eos> Is there some trick to being happy? <eos> Most days I'm feeling like a half me <eos> And feel that life is moving past me <eos> I only told you 'cause you asked me <eos> What is the story of the hour? <eos> One man's privilege and his power <eos> How it turns a sweet love oh so sour <eos> Still I need to know <eos> Am I wasting my time? Ooh <eos> Is there some trick to being happy? <eos> Most days I'm feeling like a half me <eos> And feel that life is moving past mе <eos> I only told you 'cause you asked me <eos> And feel that life is moving past me <eos> I only told you 'cause you asked me <eos> 
Oh, I’m headed to the mountains <eos> I’ll be back in a week or two <eos> Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I won’t pick up for you <eos> I’ve got some things I need to do <eos> Hmmmm <eos> Oh I’m headed to the mountains <eos> Where the air is sweet and new <eos> Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I don’t want to talk to you <eos> I’ve got some thinking to do <eos> I’m trying to let go <eos> I think it could help being alone <eos> And I’m trying not to let you make me cry <eos> I’ve spilled too many tears <eos> And I think I deserve to be alone <eos> And don’t you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go <eos> I’ve got to do this on my own <eos> I need to build myself a home <eos> Ohhhhh <eos> Oh, I’m headed to the mountains <eos> The only place I feel at peace <eos> And I knew you’d come after me so I threw away your keys <eos> But I know you'd never go when I say leave <eos> I’m headed to the mountains... don’t wait up for me <eos> 
Danger danger <eos> I can read your mind <eos> Wouldn’t change it <eos> ‘Cus I fall this way <eos> And feels so right <eos> Yeah it all feels right <eos> I can’t believe that I would ever stand so close to you <eos> It doesn’t matter where this ends up, I ain’t leaving <eos> Know what I’m doing, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> I try to act like it ain’t ever gonna bother me <eos> But when you talk like that you make it feel so easy <eos> Know where I’m headed, I’ve already thought all this through <eos> I know I know <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> Maybe I maybe I’m <eos> Just a detour back to <eos> I don’t mind no, ‘cus I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back running back I’m gonna let you go <eos> If you go running back oh I know that it’s gonna hurt <eos> I’m just a detour back to her <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos> Oooooh, mmmm <eos> 
It ain't alright, the hardness of my head <eos> Now close your eyes and spin around <eos> Say, hard times, you could find <eos> That it ain't the way that you want <eos> But it's still alright <eos> Late at night, do you lay around wondering? <eos> Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now <eos> Say, times are hard, you get this far <eos> But it ain't the way that you want <eos> I'll be damned if this old man <eos> Don't start to counting his losses <eos> But it's still alright <eos> They say you learn a lot out there <eos> How to scorch and burn <eos> Gonna have to bury your friends <eos> And then you'll find it gets worse <eos> Standing out on the ledge <eos> With no way to get down <eos> Start praying for wings to grow <eos> Oh, baby, just let go <eos> I ain't alright, you keep spinning out ahead <eos> It was cold outside when I hit the ground <eos> Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear <eos> It will take time to grow <eos> Maybe, I don't know <eos> Hey, tonight, if you think about it again <eos> Remembering all the times that you pointed out <eos> Say, the glass is clear, but all this fear <eos> Starts a-leaving a mark <eos> Your idle hands are all that stands <eos> From your time in the dark <eos> But it's still alright <eos> 
Will you fall, fall, fall for your furies? <eos> Would you die on the blade like your daddy did? <eos> And will you not stop and shake from this worry? <eos> Would you stay on the line while your country dies? <eos> The world burns by <eos> You've got smoke in your eyes <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Yes, now go, now, all who can leave us <eos> Give what you can, oh, but take what you need <eos> And will this dark world soon become clearer? <eos> Or are we bound to stay quiet and drift off into sleep? <eos> Dreams of money and greed <eos> Such a dark destiny <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Oh, I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Will you fall, fall, fall for your furies? <eos> There's only so much that a spirit can take <eos> Will you not stop and shake from this worry? <eos> You'd be surprised what your own hands can make <eos> Within the garden gates <eos> Love emanates <eos> And I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> Yeah, I want my kids to swim in the creek <eos> 
Sometimes I'm more than lost <eos> I can't even remember what I'm here for <eos> So terrified that when my last day comes <eos> I'll be unprepared for it <eos> But I'll rise above <eos> 'Cause I was loved by you <eos> Cazadera, Cazadera <eos> Sometimes I just feel gone <eos> Can't wrap my mind around who I am <eos> I can't envision who I'll become <eos> Or remember who I was <eos> Then I recall <eos> You came and warmed me <eos> Cazadera, Cazadera <eos> Yeah, then I see <eos> That you can see me <eos> Cazadera, Cazadera <eos> Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud <eos> Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud, just a cloud <eos> Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud, just a cloud <eos> Sometimes a cloud is just a cloud <eos> I'll rise above <eos> Because I was loved by you <eos> Cazadera, Cazadera <eos> 
Well, you say what you want and you never go back <eos> My song is a song, even buried in the black <eos> Well, I cover my mouth and I straighten my back <eos> Well, I cover my mouth and I straighten my back <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> Be kind <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> Erased in the light, I feel like a fool <eos> 'Cause a game isn't fun if I never know the rules <eos> And you're measuring out becoming of cruel <eos> And you say what you say and you send me away <eos> Now you only like a... <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> Surrender is sweet, forgiveness divine <eos> But who will build statues of me when I leave you all behind? <eos> And I'm carrying weight, but I know it's not minе <eos> With half a heart, it's hard to stop, but I feel as though <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good, good woman (Come on) <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> I'm a good, good woman <eos> I'm a good woman <eos> 
I met a girl last night, she was only 23 <eos> I brought her home to mine she gave herself away to me <eos> But the light in the hallway and the silence in my room <eos> Said I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> And you were wearing that red dress when you took him upstairs <eos> The one I bought you in New York before you made this mess <eos> You've run with another, you've cut me through and through <eos> And still I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> A riverside hotel tonight <eos> With walls that catch the city lights <eos> Just tell me you want me I don't care if it's true <eos> 'Cause I don’t think I'll get used to losing you <eos> Tell me where did you learn to lie so well <eos> To love like a secret you'd never tell <eos> You've stripped me of everything and I hate you, I really do <eos> Still I don't think I'll get used to losing you <eos> 
This world can take you <eos> Need an arm round your neck, somebody you can talk to <eos> When it shakes you <eos> When no one else will say it and you need to hear the truth <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Scared to fail you <eos> Clock's countin' down and I think I got everything to prove <eos> Been a friend of trouble <eos> After losing it all, I got nothing else to lose <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> You can count on me, I can count on you <eos> To help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> Let it help you lay down what you held on to <eos> Let it break you <eos> You can count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> (Help you lay down what you held on to) <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> Count on me, if I can count on you <eos> (Help you lay down what you held on to) <eos> What you held on to <eos> 
I'm putting down the habit <eos> That habit of looking back on all of it and wishing I had done better <eos> Oh I just wanna feel it <eos> Feel that I like who I’m becoming and feel alright in the quiet <eos> I know the sun don't rise and set above me <eos> I don't want you to compromise a lot to love me <eos> But if you call <eos> I’ll turn on the light for you <eos> If you call <eos> I'm gonna be bright for you <eos> If you call <eos> I've been a little darker <eos> Than I've been wanting you to see though you've been coming ‘round needing to be looked after <eos> Well I don't have an answer <eos> Why I've been buried underneath some kind of mountain that I made <eos> Oh some disaster <eos> I know the sun don't rise and set above me <eos> I don’t want you to compromise a lot to love me <eos> But if you call <eos> I’ll turn on the light for you <eos> If you call <eos> I'm gonna be bright for you <eos> If you call <eos> I’ll tell you something that I've learned <eos> As we've been watching people leaving <eos> All the loving that we've earned <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> All the loving that we’ve earned <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> Is gonna keep us breathing <eos> It's gonna keep us breathing <eos> It's gonna keep us breathing <eos> Keep us breathing <eos> 
The Blue Danube is the common English title of An der schönen blauen Donau, Op. 314 (German for At the Beautiful Blue Danube), a waltz by the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II, composed in 1866. Originally performed 13 February 1867 at a concert of the Wiener Männergesangsverein (Vienna Men's Choral a**ociation), it has been one of the most consistently popular pieces of music in the classical repertoire. Its initial performance was only a mild success however and Strauss is reputed to have said "The devil take the waltz, my only regret is for the coda-I wish that had been a success!" <eos>

I will not follow the blind and betray my heart <eos> Let's reveal your cloak and dagger affair <eos> Your obsessive lust for your collapse <eos> To deny the path will be what buries the heart <eos> The conviction you lack will be a haunting voice that remains <eos> Can you feel me in your veins? <eos> Bare your soul and breathe in the blackened frost <eos> To deny the path will be what buries the heart <eos> The conviction you lack will be a haunting voice that remains <eos> To remind you of the past <eos> We're the rejects who wander the sky <eos> We have a place for you here <eos> Tune to our frequency, leave your friends behind <eos> Bring with your decency and peace will find you <eos> I'll catch a stare from your coffin eyes <eos> I'll walk away and leave behind all the weight of the world <eos> I'll carry on, never look back, with no regrets <eos>

Over the moon, under the stars <eos> Feel them arresting me, unknowables <eos> Fading at dawn, troubles too <eos> Dimness sustains, oh, the regret <eos> I could be lost to you, lost in thought <eos> Sending a kiss back to the sky <eos> So has my world become run out of breath <eos> I'm not the only one to lose a friend <eos> Where do you go? You're going home <eos> What do I do with the void in your shape <eos> Leaving me frailty, a drop and I break <eos> What do I do with half of myself? <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I could be loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> You’re going home <eos>

You could open with your failings <eos> Make them understand, show the love notes <eos> Make them picture with their eyes closed <eos> Make them wonder where the time goes <eos> Keep your distance south of river <eos> Draw a line, they are not together <eos> Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red <eos> Make me wonder where the time went <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> Be not a stranger land here <eos> I will leave this empty-handed <eos> Feeling selfish, common as shit <eos> Leave me question where your heart lends <eos> How you open-wounded withstand <eos> Lead me into some false pretence <eos> I will ruin you in a second <eos> Leave it up to interpretation <eos> Open-ended invitation <eos> And your wedding, I could crash it <eos> Whisper in your ear “God, I missed you <eos> It's been too much, I can’t stand it” <eos> Then I cried there in the staff room <eos> Selling my seats to your concert <eos> I won't stomach it if I see you <eos> Walking so tall, I can't reach you <eos> Happier, pretty picture <eos> With some new pretty little blue <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> 
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound <eos> That saved a wretch like me <eos> I once was lost but now am found <eos> Was blind, but now I see <eos> T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear <eos> And Grace, my fears relieved <eos> How precious did that Grace appear <eos> The hour I first believed <eos> Yeah, when this flesh and heart shall fail <eos> And mortal life shall cease <eos> I shall possess within the veil <eos> A life of joy and peace <eos> Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound <eos> That saved a wretch like me <eos> I once was lost but now am found <eos> Was blind, but now I see <eos> Was blind, but now I see <eos> 
Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo giusto <eos> L tutti vivono in pace e onest <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Pien d'umanit in fondo all'anima <eos> Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo chiaro <eos> L anche la notte meno oscura <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Nella fantasia esiste un vento caldo <eos> Che soffia sulle citt, come amico <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Pien d'umanit in fondo all'anima <eos> 
Quando sono sola <eos> Sogno all'orizzonte <eos> E mancan le parole <eos> Si lo so che non c'e luce <eos> In una stanza quando manca il sole <eos> Se non ci sei tu con me, con me <eos> Su le finestre <eos> Mostra a tutti il mio cuore <eos> Che hai accesso <eos> Chiudi dentro me <eos> La luce che <eos> Hai incontrato per strada <eos> Time to say goodbye <eos> Paesi che non ho mai <eos> Veduto e vissuto con te <eos> Adesso si li vivro <eos> Con te partirò <eos> Su navi per mari <eos> Che, io lo so <eos> No, no, non esistono piu <eos> It's time to say goodbye <eos> Quando sei lontana <eos> Sogno all'orizzonte <eos> E mancan le parole <eos> E io si lo so <eos> Che sei con me, con me <eos> Tu mia luna tu sei qui con me <eos> Mio sole tu sei qui con me <eos> Con me, con me, con me <eos> Time to say goodbye <eos> Paesi che non ho mai <eos> Veduto e vissuto con te <eos> Adesso si li vivro <eos> Con te partirò <eos> Su navi per mari <eos> Che, io lo so <eos> No, no, non esistono piu <eos> Con te io li rivivro <eos> Con te partiro <eos> Su navi per mari <eos> Che, io lo so <eos> No, no, non esistono piu <eos> Con te io li rivivro <eos> Con te partirò <eos> Io con te <eos> 
I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go <eos> And help us to be wise in times when we don't know <eos> Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way <eos> Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace <eos> To a place where we'll be safe <eos> La luce che tu hai <eos> I pray we'll find your light <eos> Nel cuore resterà <eos> And hold it in our hearts <eos> A ricordarci che <eos> When stars go out each night <eos> Eterna stella sei <eos> Nella mia preghiera <eos> Let this be our prayer <eos> Quanta fede c'è <eos> When shadows fill our day <eos> Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace <eos> Give us faith so we'll be safe <eos> Sogniamo un mondo senza più violenza <eos> Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza <eos> Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino <eos> Simbolo di pace, di fraternità <eos> La forza che ci da <eos> We ask that life be kind <eos> E il desiderio che <eos> And watch us from above <eos> Ognuno trovi amor <eos> We hope each soul will find <eos> Intorno e dentro se <eos> Another soul to love <eos> Let this be our prayer <eos> Let this be our prayer, just like every child <eos> Just like every child <eos> Need to find a place, guide us with your grace <eos> Give us faith so we'll be safe <eos> È la fede che <eos> Hai acceso in noi <eos> Sento che ci salvera <eos>

Per non buttare via le lacrime che ho pianto <eos> Alzarmi ancora in volo e darmi un senso anche da solo <eos> Con questa musica che canto senza te <eos> Ma il mio teatro è vuoto e questa folla è muta… <eos> Eppure sai, non ti ho scordata <eos> E fino a ieri musica eri stata <eos> Ed è per questo che, io che non ho mai finto <eos> Da solo mi son chiesto <eos> Adesso per chi canto…? <eos> Amore e musica <eos> Sono di nuovo qua <eos> Per quanto fiato avrò <eos> La voce e l'anima è tutto quel che ho… <eos> È tutto quel che ho…. è tutto quel che ho….. <eos> Per non buttare via la mia disperazione <eos> Per non toccare il fondo e farne una canzone… <eos> Amore e musica che fanno il girotondo <eos> Di nuovo son per mano <eos> In questo mio teatro pieno <eos> Ho ritrovato me <eos> Ho ritrovato … <eos> Amore e musica <eos> Sono di nuovo qua <eos> Per quanto fiato avrò <eos> La voce e l'anima è tutto quel che ho… <eos> È tutto quel che ho…. è tutto quel che ho….. <eos> Amore e musica… <eos> Come due cuori affiatati nei cori farò… io farò <eos> Del tuo canto il vanto mio <eos> E il nostro incanto <eos> Fari accesi contro il buio <eos> Come teneri amanti <eos> Gli occhi lucidi in platea <eos> E noi fra tanti <eos> Amore e musica ancora son per mano <eos> Se nel mio teatro pieno io <eos> Ho ritrovato… ho ritrovato te <eos> Amore e Musica <eos> English Translation: <eos> LOVE AND MUSIC <eos> I don't want to waste all these tears I've shed <eos> I want to fly and make it all alone <eos> With this song I'm singing without you <eos> But my theatre is empty and this crowd is silent <eos> And yet you know so well I haven't forgotten you <eos> Because till yesterday you were music to me <eos> And that's why, never pretending <eos> I asked myself: "who am I singing for now?�? <eos> Love and music <eos> I'm here again <eos> Till my last breath <eos> My voice and my soul are everything I have <eos> I don't want to waste my desperation <eos> Don't want to hit rock bottom and write a song <eos> Love and music on the merry-go round <eos> Are hand in hand once again <eos> In this crowded theatre <eos> I've found myself again <eos> I've found myself <eos> Love and music… <eos> In the choir I'll be like two hearts beating as one <eos> As your song will be my pride <eos> And our charm <eos> Headlights on towards the darkness <eos> Like tender lovers <eos> Wet eyes in the audience <eos> And us, lost in the crowd <eos> Love and music are still hand in hand <eos> If in my crowded theatre <eos> I've found you again….Found you again <eos> Love and music <eos> 
When you walk through a storm <eos> Hold your head up high <eos> And don't be afraid of the dark <eos> At the end of the storm <eos> There's a golden sky <eos> And the sweet silver song of the lark <eos> Walk on through the wind <eos> Walk on through the rain <eos> Though your dreams be tossed and blown <eos> Walk on, walk on <eos> With hope in your heart <eos> And you'll never walk alone <eos> You'll never walk alone <eos> When you walk through a storm <eos> Hold your head up high <eos> And don't be afraid of the dark <eos> At the end of the storm <eos> There's a golden sky <eos> And the sweet silver song of the lark <eos> Walk on through the wind <eos> Walk on through the rain <eos> Though your dreams bе tossed and blown <eos> Walk on, walk on <eos> With hope in your heart <eos> And you'll nеver walk alone <eos> 
In the midst of my confusion <eos> In the time of desperate need <eos> When I am thinking not too clearly <eos> A gentle voice does intercede <eos> Slow down, slow down, be still <eos> Be still and wait, on the Spirit of the Lord <eos> Slow down and hear His voice <eos> And know that He is God <eos> In the time of tribulation <eos> When I'm feeling so unsure <eos> When things are pressing in about me <eos> Comes a gentle voice so still, so pure <eos> Slow down, slow down, be still, my child <eos> Be still and wait, on the Spirit of the Lord <eos> Slow down and hear His voice <eos> And know that He is God <eos> And know that He is God <eos> 
No me abandones así <eos> Hablando sólo de ti <eos> Ven y devuélveme al fin la sonrisa que se fue <eos> Una vez más tocar tu piel <eos> El hondo suspirar <eos> Recuperemos lo que se ha perdido <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Quiéreme otra vez <eos> Borra el dolor que al irte me dio <eos> Cuando te separaste de mí <eos> Dime que si <eos> Yo no quiero llorar <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Extraño el amor que se fue <eos> Extraño la dicha también <eos> Quiero que vengas a mí <eos> Y me vuelvas a querer <eos> No puedo más si tú no estás <eos> Tienes que llegar <eos> Mi vida se apaga sin ti a mi lado <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Quiéreme otra vez <eos> Borra el dolor que al irte me dio <eos> Cuando te separaste de mí <eos> Dime que si <eos> Yo no quiero llorar <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> No me abandonas así <eos> Hablando sólo de ti <eos> Devuélveme la pasión de tus brazos <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Quiéreme otra vez <eos> Borra el dolor que al irte me dio <eos> Cuando te separaste de mí <eos> Dime que si <eos> Yo no quiero llorar <eos> Borra el dolor <eos> Que al irte me dio <eos> Cuando te separaste de mi <eos> Dime que si <eos> Dime que si <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> 
Che bella cosa na jurnata 'e sole <eos> N'aria serena doppo na tempesta! <eos> Pe'II'aria fresca pare già na festa! <eos> Che bella cosa na iurnata 'e sole! <eos> Ma n'atu sole <eos> Cchiu bello, oje <eos> 'o sole mio <eos> Sta 'nfronte a te! <eos> 'O sole, 'o sole mio <eos> Sta nfronte a te <eos> Sta nfronte a te! <eos> Quanno fa notte e' sole se ne scenne <eos> Mme vene quase 'na malincunia; <eos> Sotto 'a fenesta toia restarria <eos> Quanno fa notte e 'o sole se ne scenne <eos> Ma n'atu sole, ecc <eos> 
When all the world is a hopeless jumble <eos> And the raindrops tumble all around <eos> Heaven opens a magic lane <eos> When all the clouds darken up the skyway <eos> There's a rainbow highway to be found <eos> Leading from your windowpane <eos> To a place behind the sun <eos> Just a step beyond the rain <eos> Somewhere over the rainbow way up high <eos> There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby <eos> Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue <eos> And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true <eos> Someday I'll wish upon a star <eos> And wake up where the clouds are far behind me <eos> Where troubles melt like lemon drops <eos> Away, above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me <eos> Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly <eos> Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I ? <eos> If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow <eos> Why oh why can't I ? <eos> 
Quand'è che spento il cuore? <eos> Che ho smesso di sognare <eos> Un nuovo amore? <eos> Il dubbio dentro me <eos> E ho smesso di sperare <eos> Ma a un tratto, tu <eos> Risvegli nel profondo <eos> Un fuoco che mi accende <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and resterò <eos> Per costruire un sogno <eos> One more time <eos> Who cares about the past? <eos> Who knows about tomorrow? <eos> L'amore è adesso <eos> And maybe this won't last <eos> Maybe this moment's all we have <eos> Let's find out <eos> And though I'm still afraid <eos> You're worth a leap of faith <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> To see the world that we make <eos> I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> As if my heart cannot break <eos> One more time <eos> Here and now, up against the edge <eos> Promise me you won't look down <eos> Won't fall off the ledge <eos> Take my hand and show me how to love again <eos> And I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> Per costruire ancora <eos> One more time <eos> 
Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour <eos> Souris à nos ivresses <eos> Nuit plus douce que le jour <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Le temps fuit et sans retour <eos> Emporte nos tendresses <eos> Loin de cet heureux séjour <eos> Le temps fuit sans retour <eos> Zéphyrs embrasés <eos> Versez-nous vos caresses <eos> Zéphyrs embrasés <eos> Donnez-nous vos baisers! <eos> Vos baisers! vos baisers! Ah! <eos> Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour <eos> Souris à nos ivresses <eos> Nuit plus douce que le jour <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Ô belle nuit d'amour! <eos> Ah! Souris à nos ivresses! <eos> Nuit d'amour, ô nuit d'amour! <eos> Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! <eos> 
Penso che un sogno cosi` non ritorni mai piu` <eos> Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu <eos> Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito <eos> E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> E volavo volavo felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva <eos> Lontano laggiu` <eos> Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscon perche` <eos> Quando tramonta la luna li porta con se` <eos> Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli <eos> Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> E continuo a volare felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare <eos> Negli occhi tuoi blu <eos> La tua voce e` una musica dolce che suona per me... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Ritorna <eos> 
Peace is not a silent state <eos> That comes upon us from within— <eos> Serene, detached, oblivious <eos> Peace is not a force like rain <eos> That comes, unbidden, from above— <eos> Gentle, enfolding, natural <eos> Peace is fire! Yes, peace is fire! <eos> And peace is passion! <eos> Peace requires a strength of will <eos> A certain courage, a heart of iron <eos> A force abiding to fulfill <eos> Peace is not a foregone fate; <eos> For peace, like war, must be waged— <eos> Mindfully, deliberately <eos> With arms ever ready <eos> And eyes wide open <eos> 
Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Gave thee life & bid thee feed <eos> By the stream & o'er the mead; <eos> Gave thee clothing of delight <eos> Softest clothing wooly bright; <eos> Gave thee such a tender voice <eos> Making all the vales rejoice! <eos> Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee! <eos> He is called by thy name <eos> For he calls himself a Lamb: <eos> He is meek & he is mild <eos> He became a little child: <eos> I a child & thou a lamb <eos> We are called by his name <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> 

Can't bare to see those blinding lights <eos> Forwards and backwards as long as we’ve stayed moving silently <eos> For what it’s worth, I’ve tried to throw the scent off trail as well <eos> But you can’t hide in plain sight <eos> So stop pretending as though you’re fooling anyone <eos> Can’t bare to see those blinding lights in your eyes when nobody’s home <eos> Patterns that can't be explained carried you away <eos> Bystanding here as you decay is fucking killing me <eos> 'Cus you can’t hide in plain sight so stop pretending as though you’re fooling anyone <eos> Can’t bare to see those blinding lights in your eyes when nobody’s home <eos>

The way to earn money as a Pokémon Champion is to start beating up on some random kid's pets and start stealing their cash <eos> But what do the earnings of a Pokémon master truly look like? <eos> Pokémon Johto, let's go <eos> Chase your dreams <eos> Just prepare to file for bankruptcy (for bankruptcy) <eos> Even in if you get to the end you lose money on your journey <eos> It's the single WORST financial decision EVER <eos> Getting shocked over and over doesn't make it better (Pikachu) <eos> Pokémon masters are broke <eos> They can't pay them bills <eos> Being a trainer's a joke <eos> They can't get that Pokéskrill <eos> Pokémon masters are broke <eos> They can't pay them bills <eos> Being a trainer's a joke <eos> No sweet, sweet Pokéskrill <eos> We've all had that dream though, right? <eos> To spend a year out of your life <eos> In the world of Pokémon <eos> To become a champion <eos> Armed with only a few Pokéballs <eos> Traveling the land to catch animals <eos> And make 'em fight eternal blood sport to the death (to the death) <eos> You see, video games tend to gloss over the rest of live (the rest of live) <eos> What do the earning of a Pokémon master truly look like?

When the cold of winter comes <eos> Starless night will cover day <eos> In the veiling of the sun <eos> We will walk in bitter rain <eos> But in dreams (But in dreams) <eos> I can hear your name <eos> And in dreams (And in dreams) <eos> We will meet again <eos> When the seas and mountains fall <eos> And we come, to end of days <eos> In the dark I hear a call <eos> Calling me there <eos> I will go there <eos> And back again <eos>

Ave Maria! Maiden mild <eos> Oh! Listen to a maidens prayer <eos> For thou canst hear them in the wild <eos> Tis thou, tis thou canst hear amid despair <eos> We slumbered safely 'til the morrow <eos> Though we, by men outcast, reviled <eos> Oh maiden, see a maidens sorrow <eos> Oh mother, hear a suppliant child! <eos> Ave Maria, ahh <eos> Ave Maria <eos> Gratia plena <eos> Maria, gratia plena <eos> Maria, gratia plena <eos> Ave, ave Dominus <eos> Dominus tecum <eos> The murky caverns air so heavy <eos> Shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled <eos> Oh maiden, hear a maiden pleading <eos> Oh mother, hear a suppliant child! <eos> Ave Maria <eos>

When a humble bard graced a ride along <eos> With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song <eos> From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil <eos> His army of elves at his hooves did they revel <eos> They came after me with masterful deceit <eos> Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth <eos> While the Devil's horns minced our tender meat <eos> And so cried the Witcher, "He can't be bleat" <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty <eos> At the edge of the world, fight the mighty horn <eos> That bashes and breaks you and brings you to mourn <eos> He thrust every elf far back on the shelf <eos> High up on the mountain from whence it came <eos> He wiped out your pest, got kicked in his chest <eos> He's a friend of humanity, so give him the rest <eos> That's my epic tale: our champion prevailed <eos> Defeated the villain, now pour him some ale <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, a-oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> 

Many's the time I've been mistaken <eos> And many times confused <eos> Yes, and I've often felt forsaken <eos> And certainly misused <eos> Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right <eos> I'm just weary to my bones <eos> Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant <eos> So far away from home <eos> So far away from home <eos> I don't know a soul who's not been battered <eos> I don't have a friend who feels at ease <eos> I don't know a dream that's not been shattered <eos> Or driven to its knees <eos> Oh, but it's all right, it's all right <eos> For we've lived so well so long <eos> Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on <eos> I wonder what's gone wrong <eos> I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong <eos> And I dreamed I was dying <eos> I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly <eos> And looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly <eos> And I dreamed I was flying <eos> And high up above, my eyes could clearly see <eos> The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea <eos> And I dreamed I was flying <eos> We come on the ship they call the Mayflower <eos> We come on the ship that sailed the moon <eos> We come in the age's most uncertain hour <eos> And sing an American tune <eos> But it's all right, it's all right, all right <eos> You can't be forever blessed <eos> Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day <eos> And I'm trying to get some rest <eos> That's all I'm trying to get some rest <eos> 
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> The kids were young and pretty <eos> Where have you been? Where did you go? <eos> Those summer nights seem long ago <eos> And so is the girl you used to call <eos> The Queen of New York City <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> The power of youth is on my mind <eos> Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time <eos> Will you still love me when I shine <eos> From words but not from beauty? <eos> My father's love was always strong <eos> My mother's glamour lives on and on <eos> Yet still inside, I felt alone <eos> For reasons unknown to me <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> And if you call, I'll run, run, run <eos> If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> And we were young and pretty <eos> 
"Let me show you somethin'" <eos> "Let me show you somethin'" <eos> Dr. Octagon, paramedic fetus of the East <eos> With priests, I'm from the Church of the Operating Room <eos> With the strikes of force, scalpels since the holocaust <eos> I do indeed in greed, explore meet the patients <eos> Back to brooms with the nurse with the voodoo curse <eos> Holding up office lights, standing at huge heights <eos> Back and forth, left wing swing to North <eos> East and South with blood pouring down your mouth <eos> I come prepared with the white suit and stethoscope <eos> Listen to your heartbeat—delete, beep, beep, beep! <eos> Your insurance is high, but my price is cheap <eos> Look at the lamp... <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> Growing by the purple pond in the purple pastures <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> Growing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> Growing by the pond, look, it's raining yellow <eos> Would you care to listen to any more? Think about it <eos> Holding bags on down right from the hospital <eos> It's a patient that's worth to keep the germs off the turf <eos> Cybernetic microscopes and metal antidotes <eos> Two telescopes that magnify size of a roach <eos> Three computers, the cup of coffee planted with my hand and <eos> Astroplanet detached, turn on rear foggers <eos> Cut the light on the kid, and turn the bright on <eos> Supersonic waves combine and burn as brainwaves <eos> I see the mascot of evil he's not Kneivel <eos> Shakespeare's gone don't even think about it <eos> Yes, as I'm going to the park, I see... <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> It's raining green, by the pond <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> It's totally raining green, pouring <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> I smell the bees and the birds <eos> Blue Flowers! <eos> Different aspects of life, blue flowers <eos> Scratch Interlude <eos> 
Je suis une poupée de cire, une poupée de son <eos> Mon cœur est gravé dans mes chansons <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Suis-je meilleure, suis-je pire qu'une poupée de salon <eos> Je vois la vie en rose bonbon <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Mes disques sont un miroir <eos> Dans lequel chacun peut me voir <eos> Je suis partout à la fois <eos> Brisée en mille éclats de voix <eos> Autour de moi j'entends rire les poupées de chiffon <eos> Celles qui dansent sur mes chansons <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Elles se laissent séduire pour un oui, pour un non <eos> L'amour n'est pas que dans les chansons <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Mes disques sont un miroir <eos> Dans lequel chacun peut me voir <eos> Je suis partout à la fois <eos> Brisée en mille éclats de voix <eos> Seule parfois je soupire <eos> Je me dis à quoi bon <eos> Chanter ainsi l'amour sans raison <eos> Sans rien connaître des garçons <eos> Je n'suis qu'une poupée de cire, qu'une poupée de son <eos> Sous le soleil de mes cheveux blonds <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Mais un jour je vivrai mes chansons <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> Sans craindre la chaleur des garçons <eos> Poupée de cire, poupée de son <eos> 
We've come so far <eos> And we've reached so high <eos> And we've looked each day and night in the eye <eos> And we're still so young <eos> And we hope for more <eos> We've come a long way <eos> But we're not too sure where we've been <eos> We've had success <eos> We've had good times <eos> But remember this <eos> Been on this path of life for so long <eos> Feel I've walked a thousand miles <eos> Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love <eos> Everybody's been there <eos> With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope <eos> And I knew I could make it <eos> Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw <eos> My face in the moonlight <eos> Just then I realised what a fool I could be <eos> Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me <eos> Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still <eos> There's a road going down the other side of this hill <eos> Never forget where you've come here from <eos> Never pretend that it's all real <eos> Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream <eos> This will be someone else's dream <eos> Safe from the arms of disappointment for so long <eos> Feel each day we've come too far <eos> Yet each day seems to make much more <eos> Sure is good to be here <eos> I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now <eos> And it feels so unreal <eos> At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make <eos> And the fact of reality <eos> Never forget where you've come here from <eos> Never pretend that it's all real <eos> Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream <eos> This will be someone else's dream <eos> We've come so far and we've reached so high <eos> And we've looked each day and night in the eye <eos> And we're still so young and we hope for more <eos> But remember this <eos> We're not invincible <eos> We're not invincible, no <eos> We're only people <eos> We're only people <eos> (we're not invincible) <eos> Hey we're not invincible <eos> We're not invincible <eos> So again I'll tell you <eos> Never forget where you've come here from <eos> Never pretend that it's all real <eos> Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream <eos> This will be someone else's dream <eos> Never, everybody sing, oh baby <eos> Never, no never, never forget for love <eos> Someday, louder, louder, louder, louder loud <eos> Never, everybody sing that song <eos> Never, yeah, louder, louder, louder, louder loud <eos> Someday soon this will all be someone else's dream <eos> This will be someone else's dream <eos> We've come so far and we've reached so high <eos> And we've looked each day and night in the eye <eos> And we're still so young and we hope for more <eos> 
Where you are, that's where I wanna be <eos> Through your eyes are all the things I wanna see <eos> In the night you are my dream <eos> You're everything to me <eos> You're the love of my life <eos> And the breath in my prayers <eos> Take my hand and lead me there <eos> What I need is you here <eos> I can't forget the taste of your mouth <eos> From your lips, all the heavens pour out <eos> I can't forget when we are one <eos> With you alone I am free <eos> Everyday, every night <eos> You alone are the love of my life <eos> Alright, alright <eos> Everyday, every night <eos> You alone are the love of my life <eos> We go dancing in the moonlight <eos> With the starlight in your eyes <eos> We go dancing till the sunrise <eos> You and me, we're gonna dance, dance, dance <eos> 
I've been taking my time for a long time <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> Speaking English as a foreign language <eos> Any words that I haven't forgot <eos> I've been thinking how I can't be bothered <eos> To wash the dishes or remake the bed <eos> What's the point when I could doss instead? <eos> I've been hanging out with various riff-raff <eos> Somewhere on the Goldhawk road <eos> I don't think it's gonna be much longer <eos> 'Til I'm mugging up on the penal code <eos> Love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> Like all their aspirations, it's a fantasy <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> You made me see reality <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> It's a blatant fallacy <eos> You won't see me with a bunch of roses <eos> Promising fidelity <eos> Love doesn't mean a thing to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> While the bankers all get their bonuses <eos> I'll just get along with what I've got <eos> Watching the weeds in the garden <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> I'll explore the outer limits of boredom <eos> Moaning periodically <eos> Just a full-time lonely layabout, that's me <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> It's absolutely clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> Just like they said at university <eos> I'll be taking my time for a long time <eos> With all the schadenfreude it's cost <eos> Calculating what you've lost <eos> Now I'm digging through my student paperbacks <eos> Flicking through Karl Marx again <eos> Searching for the soul of England <eos> Drinking tea like Tony Benn <eos> Love is just a bourgeois construct <eos> So I'm giving up the bourgeoisie <eos> Until you come back to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> 
If I should die this very moment <eos> I wouldn't fear <eos> For I've never known completeness <eos> Like being here <eos> Wrapped in the warmth of you <eos> Loving every breath of you <eos> Still my heart this moment <eos> Or it might burst <eos> Could we stay right here <eos> Until the end of time until the earth stops turning <eos> Wanna love you until the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> All this time I've loved you <eos> And never known your face <eos> All this time I've missed you <eos> And searched this human race <eos> Here is true peace <eos> Here my heart knows calm <eos> Safe in your soul <eos> Bathed in your sighs <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> All I've known, all I've done, all I've felt <eos> Was leading to this <eos> All I've known, all I've done, all I've felt <eos> Was leading to this <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one <eos> I've waited for <eos> Wanna stay right here 'til the end of time <eos> 'Til the earth stops turning <eos> Gonna love you 'til the seas run dry <eos> I've found the one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one I've waited for <eos> The one <eos> I've waited for <eos> Ooh, oh <eos>

I know the stars are gonna leave us the later it gets <eos> I know the moon is gonna disappear into the west <eos> I know the sun is gonna come and steal your silhouette <eos> But not yet, no, not yet <eos> 'Cause you still got a lotta kisses left on your lips <eos> Yeah, you still got a lotta time to take away my breath <eos> You still got a lotta drivin' me wild left <eos> With that smile, with those eyes, I ain't done lovin' you tonight <eos> Not yet, not yet <eos> We'll find the bottom of the bottle eventually <eos> And we're gonna run out of excuses to not go to sleep <eos> And I wanna hold you while you're driftin' off to dream <eos> But not yet, no, not yet <eos> 'Cause you still got a lotta kisses left on your lips <eos> Yeah, you still got a lotta time to take away my breath <eos> You still got a lotta drivin' me wild left <eos> With that smile, with those eyes, I ain't done lovin' you tonight <eos> Not yet, no, not yet <eos> We still got some memories left to make <eos> Before tonight turns into yesterday, hey, yeah, yeah <eos> You still got a lotta kisses left on your lips <eos> Yeah, you still got a lotta time to take away my breath <eos> You still got a lotta drivin' me wild left <eos> With that smile, with those eyes, I ain't done lovin' you tonight <eos> Not yet, not yet <eos> Not yet, not yet <eos> 
A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos> 
I know it ain't all that late <eos> But you should probably leave <eos> I recognize that look in your eyes <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> You want me to say that I want you to stay <eos> So you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> There's still time for you to finish your wine <eos> Then you should probably leave <eos> And it's hard to resist, alright, just one kiss <eos> Then you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> You want me to say that I want you to stay <eos> So you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> Like a devil on my shoulder you keep whisperin' in my ear <eos> And it's gettin' kinda hard for me to do the right thing here <eos> I wanna do the right thing, baby <eos> Sun on your skin, 6AM <eos> And I been watchin' you sleep <eos> And honey, I'm so afraid you're gonna wake up and say <eos> That you should probably leave <eos> 'Cause I know you and you know me <eos> And we both know where this is gonna lead <eos> I want you to stay but you'll probably say <eos> That you should probably leave <eos> Yeah, you should probably leave <eos> Oh, you should probably leave <eos>

It didn't really take a hundred years to get to twenty-one <eos> It didn't take a whole case of beer to have a little fun <eos> And a fire don't need gasoline and a Black Cat to get lit, nah <eos> But to us it did <eos> That first kiss didn't really get you higher than the moon <eos> And takin' hits off cigarettes didn't really make you cool <eos> That first check from that first job don't really make you rich, naw <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did, yeah <eos> A brand new guitar don't make you a star, and a broken heart don't really break <eos> Don't mean you ain't a man if you didn't cliff jump into that lake <eos> That corner spot in McDonald's lot don't mean a lot to most kids <eos> Ah, but to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> Oh, to us it did, oh <eos> Yeah, runnin' from them blue lights didn't make you Dukes of Hazzard <eos> How hard you punch, how far you hit, it didn't really matter <eos> Oh, wasted time shouldn't qualify for the nights you won't forget, no <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big (Yeah) <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> (Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour) <eos> (That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big) Oh, it wasn't big <eos> (Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers) <eos> (Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly) <eos> But to us it did <eos> 
Firewood crackle in the fall air <eos> "Red Dirt" playing on a radio <eos> Big Dipper hanging high up there <eos> Breathe in the Backwoods and let it go <eos> I ain't ever been the church goin' type <eos> Can't quote much past 3:16 <eos> Even though it's a Friday night <eos> Church found me <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen <eos> Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends <eos> When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen <eos> Tell em' boys <eos> Yeah, baby <eos> Gotta thank him for a little piece of dirt <eos> Little peace of mind from a cold one <eos> Got a country angel I don't deserve <eos> The kind that you never let go of <eos> I don't know what Heaven looks like <eos> No, I don't think anybody does <eos> If it's like down here up there tonight <eos> And there's folks like us <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen) <eos> Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends) <eos> When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (Talkin' God, amen) <eos> (Talkin' God, amen) <eos> I don't know what Heaven looks like <eos> And who the hell does? <eos> If it's like down here up there tonight <eos> There's folks like us <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen <eos> Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, Amen (Talkin' God, amen) <eos> Killin' time, livin' life with some downhome friends (With some downhome friends) <eos> When the world's gone crazy, man, it all makes sense (Man, it all makes sense) <eos> Sittin' here, drinkin' beer, talkin' God, amen, amen (Talkin' God, amen) <eos> (Sittin' here, drinkin' beer) Talkin' God, amen <eos> (Talkin' God, amen) We're sittin' here, drinkin' beer <eos> Talkin' God, amen <eos> 
Half of my high school got too drunk <eos> Half of my high school fell in love with the girl next door <eos> In their daddy's Ford <eos> And half of my main street's mini skirts <eos> Half of my main street's dressed for church <eos> It could use some rain and a fresh coat of paint <eos> Half of my hometown's still hangin' around <eos> Still talkin' about that one touchdown <eos> They're still wearin' red and black <eos> "Go Bobcats" while the other half <eos> Of my hometown, they all got out <eos> Some went north, some went south <eos> They're still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found <eos> So stay or leave, part of me will always be <eos> Half of my hometown <eos> Half of our prom queens cut their hair <eos> Half of them think that it ain't fair <eos> The quarterback moved away and never came back <eos> Half of my family is happy I left <eos> The other half worries I'll just forget <eos> Where I came from <eos> Same place where they came from <eos> Half of my hometown's still hangin' around <eos> Still talkin' about that one touchdown <eos> They're still wearin' red and black <eos> "Go Bobcats" while the other half <eos> Of my hometown, they all got out <eos> Some went north, some went south <eos> They're still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found <eos> So stay or leave, part of me will always be <eos> Half of my hometown <eos> Mmm, half of my hometown (Oh) <eos> Backroads raise us <eos> Highways, they take us <eos> Memories make us wanna go back <eos> To our hometown, settle down <eos> Talk about that one touchdown <eos> Raise some kids in red and black <eos> "Go Bobcats" while the other half <eos> Of our hometown was in the crowd <eos> They knew the words, they sang them loud <eos> And all I wanna do is make them proud <eos> 'Cause half of me will always be Knoxville, Tennessee <eos> My hometown <eos> Oh <eos> My hometown <eos> My hometown <eos> 
Like my mama's home cooking after Sunday church <eos> Like an ice cold beer after hard work <eos> Like a hot cup of coffee on your way to town <eos> Like an underdog last second touchdown <eos> Like the feeling that you get when you get a bite <eos> Like the power of a throttle when it's open wide <eos> When the sand runs out of that hourglass <eos> You ain't ever gotta wonder, you ain't gotta ask <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, baby <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you <eos> When the sun burns out and the cows come home <eos> From now 'til forever something you can count on is <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, yeah <eos> Love them freckles that you get in the summertime <eos> And the way you get giddy off a glass of wine <eos> Even the way you take forever and you never on time <eos> Ain't a thing not to love, ain't no wonder why, baby <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, baby <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you <eos> When the sun burns out and the cows come home <eos> From now 'til forever something you can count on is <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, yeah <eos> I'm always gonna love you, yeah, yeah <eos> I'm always gonna love you, oh, yes I am <eos> If you ever second guess (I, I, I, I) <eos> Baby, just remember this and don't you ever forget <eos> Ever forget that, baby <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, baby <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you <eos> When the sun burns out and the cows come home <eos> From now 'til forever something you can count on is <eos> I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you <eos> Always gonna love you, yeah <eos> 
Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes <eos> Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo <eos> Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole <eos> Don't get no dirt on your church clothes <eos> Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves <eos> Ten percent in the offering plate <eos> Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race <eos> Sure'd be nice to get back to that place <eos> There was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Eighteen, left it all behind <eos> Chasing a girl, chasing a dime <eos> Went so far tryna get mine <eos> I can't see that old porch light <eos> That led me home at night <eos> There was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> When we didn't have much <eos> I can still hear grandma reading <eos> That red letter Book of John <eos> I can still smell coffee in the kitchen <eos> With ol' Don Williams on <eos> And there was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> 
I don't ever look back <eos> No you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> So don't think twice because <eos> I ain't afraid of the slow burn <eos> And one thing's for sure <eos> It's good to make a good thing last <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Take ahold of my hand <eos> I'm gonna love you <eos> Slow like the hourglass sand <eos> God knows, I've spent a lifetime of lonely wanderin' <eos> But I'm all in for good <eos> I wanna be your man <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Girl, I'm in it till the end <eos> Forever and again <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I don't ever look back <eos> No, you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> 
Can I tell you a secret? <eos> I might have to slide in close for you to hear it <eos> Over that bartender yelling out them drinks <eos> While the cover band off-key sings, yeah <eos> Can I tell you a secret? <eos> Between you and me <eos> All I can think about <eos> Is leaving here early to get you alone <eos> Pullin' you into me <eos> Not even music on <eos> Nothin' but you, my tee, white sheets <eos> Between you and me <eos> Between you and me, yeah <eos> Boy, you know me like no one <eos> You know I'll get done up to get me undone <eos> Killin' you in this dress all night and it's only eight <eos> And I'm down to close down this place <eos> But I'd rather close up this space <eos> Between you and me <eos> All I can think about <eos> Is leaving here early to get you alone <eos> Pullin' you into me <eos> Not even music on <eos> Nothin' but you, my tee, white sheets <eos> Between you and me <eos> Between you and me, yeah <eos> Between you and me <eos> (A whole lot of loving) <eos> Between you and me, yeah <eos> (So let's leave nothing) <eos> Between you and me <eos> All I can think about <eos> Is leaving here early to get you alone <eos> Pullin' you into me <eos> Not even music on <eos> Nothin' but you, my tee, white sheets <eos> Between you and me <eos> Between you and me, yeah <eos> 
Home sweet <eos> Touching down, from a six night honeymoon <eos> Sun kissed kids, still drunk on love <eos> Went from, all-inclusive margaritas in Malibu <eos> To praying we could pay rent this month <eos> That doormat says "Welcome Home" <eos> But I think it's wherever I’m with you <eos> It's more than some bricks and stones <eos> No, there ain't nothing like <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain't nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet <eos> You and me <eos> Your love is like, a porch swing on Sunday <eos> Just as gentle as a summer sunrise <eos> They say "It's where the heart is", well, mine's with you, babe <eos> Long as I got your hand, I'm fine, yeah <eos> Could be white brick and picket fences <eos> Or some busted AC hotel room <eos> It's all picture perfect if you're in it <eos> No, it don't get much better than <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> A quarter acre and a two-bed farmhouse <eos> Polaroid kiss, with the red sold sign <eos> Sitting on boxes in the living room laughing and crying <eos> Just staring at them two pink lines, huh <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> Time to make a little more room in our <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Yeah, we got it all and you're still all I need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me, yeah (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos>

Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos> Sun dress on the front steps <eos> Sun up by the lake <eos> Blanket down in the backyard <eos> Lying wide awake <eos> That's a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Moonlight on the back seat <eos> A breeze through the wires <eos> Springsteen on the speakers <eos> Girl, I'm on fire <eos> That's stuff I don't think about <eos> 'Cause it still kills me now <eos> I still can't dance around <eos> That memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> It's good running into you like this <eos> But, girl, I'm close as I can get <eos> To a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos>

Goin' down like a sunset <eos> Burnin' out like a cigarette <eos> Blowin' through the cash, through the past <eos> Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left <eos> I could go on and on <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> I could drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> Trying to ride out the midnight <eos> Trying to fight through the daylight <eos> Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that <eos> I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> 
It's like the sun went down just to frame your face <eos> Like they played that song just to see you sway <eos> Like that old surf shop had you in mind <eos> With what you got on, makin' those tan lines <eos> It's like the ocean knows we're layin' <eos> On this beach tonight <eos> It's like the sand's been waitin' <eos> For you to come alive 'cause <eos> You were made for summer <eos> Just like these stars we're under <eos> We're made for lightin' this July sky up <eos> Blanket down made for me and you tied up <eos> All night long, over and over <eos> Crash into me and pull mе closer <eos> Kiss by kiss, one after anothеr <eos> Don't let it go, baby, let this summer <eos> Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves <eos> Keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves <eos> Wish I could bottle up the taste on your lips <eos> That margarita saltwater sunburned sip <eos> It's like I feel that sun right next to me <eos> Yeah, girl, your touch is a hundred degrees <eos> Boardwalks were made for dancin' <eos> And flip flops were made to lose like <eos> This night was meant to happen <eos> And, girl, I was made for you like <eos> You were made for summer <eos> Just like these stars we're under <eos> We're made for lightin' this July sky up <eos> Blanket down made for me and you tied up <eos> All night long, over and over <eos> Crash into me and pull me closer <eos> Kiss by kiss, one after another <eos> Don't let it go, baby, let this summer <eos> Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves <eos> Keep on comin' in waves, keep on comin' in waves <eos> Keep on comin' in waves, keep on comin' in waves <eos> Keep on comin' in waves <eos> Baby, you were made for summer <eos> Just like these stars we're under <eos> We're made for lightin' this July sky up <eos> Blanket down made for me and you tied up <eos> All night long, over and over <eos> Crash into me and pull me closer <eos> Kiss by kiss, one after another <eos> Don't let it go, baby, let this summer <eos> Just keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves <eos> Keep on comin' in waves, keep comin' in waves <eos>

When the sun goes down on my side of town <eos> That lonesome feelin' comes to my door <eos> And the whole world turns <eos> Blue <eos> There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks <eos> I've got a table for two, way in the back <eos> Where I sit alone <eos> And think of losin' you <eos> I spend most every night <eos> Beneath the light of a neon moon <eos> Now if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free <eos> I close my eyes and sometimes see <eos> You in the shadows <eos> Of this smoke-filled room <eos> No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried <eos> Or how many lies that I've lied <eos> Tellin' my poor heart <eos> She'll come back someday <eos> Oh, but I'll be alright <eos> As long as there's light from a neon moon <eos> Oh, if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> The jukebox plays on, drink by drink <eos> And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think <eos> And this hurt inside of me <eos> Ain't never gonna end <eos> Oh, but I'll be alright <eos> As long as there's light from a neon moon <eos> Oh, if you lose your one and only <eos> There's always room here for the lonely <eos> To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams <eos> Of a neon moon <eos> Come watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> Oh, watch your broken dreams dance <eos> In and out of the beams of a neon moon <eos> 
I was drivin' through Georgia in late July <eos> On a day hot enough to make the devil sigh <eos> I saw a homemade sign writtin' in red <eos> Rhine county watermelon festival ahead <eos> Well, I wasn't in a hurry so I slowed down <eos> Took a two lane road to a one horse town <eos> There was a party goin' on when I got there <eos> I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor <eos> He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine <eos> Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine <eos> Help yourself to some, but obey the law <eos> If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl <eos> When the band started playin the watermelon queen <eos> Said let me show you somethin' that you ain't never seen <eos> She grabbed me by the arm said come on let's go <eos> She dipped down, spun around, and do-ce-doed <eos> She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees <eos> She craweled across the floor and jumped back to her feet <eos> She wiggled and she giggled and be all you ever saw <eos> She said this is how you do the watermelon crawl <eos> He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine <eos> Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine <eos> Help yourself to some, but obey the law <eos> If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl <eos> If your ever down in Georgia around about July <eos> If you ain't in a hurry then you oughta stop by <eos> I can guarantee that you're goin have a ball <eos> Learnin' how to do the watermelon crawl <eos> He said we got a hundred gallons of sweet red wine <eos> Made from the biggest watermelons on the vine <eos> Help yourself to some, but obey the law <eos> If you drink don't drive do the watermelon crawl <eos> Yeah, do the watermelon crawl <eos> Have fun you all <eos> Do the watermelon crawl <eos> 
They were farm kids way down in Dixie <eos> Met in high school in the sixties <eos> Everyone knew it was love from the start <eos> One July, in the midnight hour <eos> He climbed upon the water tower <eos> Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said that he should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> They settled down on eighty acres <eos> Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes <eos> They went together like a hand and a glove <eos> On a clear day from their front yard <eos> If you look and know what to look for <eos> Off to the east, you can still read his words of love <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the boy should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> Now more than once the town has discovered <eos> Painting over it ain't no use <eos> There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it <eos> The heart keeps showing through <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the fool should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> Ah, paint it green boy <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the boy should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> John Deere green <eos>

When I was fourteen I was fallin' fast <eos> For a blue-eyed girl in my homeroom class <eos> Tryin to find the courage to ask her out <eos> Was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout <eos> What she would've said, I can't say <eos> I never did ask then she moved away <eos> I learned something from my blue-eyed girl <eos> Sink or swim, you gotta give it a whirl <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> The longer I live the more I believe <eos> You do have to give if you wanna receive <eos> There's a time to listen, a time to talk <eos> And you might have to crawl even after you walk <eos> Had sure things blow up in my face <eos> Seen the long-shot win the race <eos> Been knocked down by the slammin' door <eos> Picked myself up and came back for more <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Take a chance on love <eos> Life's a dance <eos> You learn as you go <eos>

Creole Williams lived down a dirt road <eos> He made homemade wine like nobody I know <eos> I dropped by one Friday night and said, "Can you help me, Creole? <eos> I got a little girl waiting on me, and I want to treat her right." <eos> He said "I got what you need, son," as we sat down in the cellar <eos> He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said <eos> "There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time" <eos> You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway <eos> My old heart was racing as you climbed inside <eos> You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road <eos> And watched the sun fade in that big red sky <eos> I reached under the front seat and said, "Now here's something special <eos> It's just been waiting for a night like tonight <eos> "There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time" <eos> You're still with me <eos> We've made some memories <eos> After all these years <eos> There's one thing I've found <eos> Some say good love <eos> Is like a fine wine <eos> It keeps getting better <eos> As the days go by <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time <eos> Don't let it fool you! <eos> 
I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say <eos> "Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of running away <eos> Settling down, would you marry me <eos> If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?" <eos> She'd have said yes in a New York minute <eos> They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it <eos> He just stole a kiss as he rode away <eos> He never hung his hat up <eos> At Kitty's place <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should've been a cowboy <eos> I might've had a sidekick with a funny name <eos> Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James <eos> Ending up on the brink of danger <eos> Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers <eos> Go west, young man, haven't you been told <eos> California's full of whiskey, women and gold <eos> Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars <eos> With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should have been a cowboy <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should have been a cowboy <eos> Yeah, I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should have been a cowboy <eos>

(verse one) <eos> She's been going out with him <eos> She's been going out with me <eos> Said she'd let us know by tonight which one it would be <eos> So I waited by the phone <eos> But she never called me up <eos> Had to know what was going on <eos> So I drove by her house, and sure enough... <eos> (Chorus) <eos> That ain't my truck in her drive <eos> Man this ain't my day tonight <eos> Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck <eos> That ain't my shadow on her wall <eos> Lord this don't look good at all <eos> That's my girl, my whole world <eos> But that ain't my truck <eos> (verse two) <eos> I pulled over by the curb <eos> I've been sitting here all night <eos> Wondering what it was I did so wrong that he did so right <eos> I thought of breaking down the door <eos> But there's nothing left to say <eos> That Chevy 4x4 says it all <eos> Sitting in my place <eos> (Chorus) <eos> That ain't my truck in her drive <eos> Man this ain't my day tonight <eos> Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck <eos> That ain't my shadow on her wall <eos> Lord, this don't look good at all <eos> That's my girl <eos> My whole world <eos> But that ain't my truck <eos> That ain't my shadow on her wall <eos> Lord this don't look good at all <eos> That's my girl <eos> My whole world <eos> But that ain't my truck <eos> That's my girl <eos> My whole world <eos> But that ain't my truck <eos> That's my girl....my whole world...(repeat to fade) <eos> 
Sister cries out, from her baby bed <eos> Brother runs in, feathers on his head <eos> Mama's in her room learnin' how to sew <eos> Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio <eos> Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap <eos> Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope <eos> Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound <eos> Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town <eos> Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone" <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> The South moves north, North moves south <eos> A star is born, a star burns out <eos> The only thing that stays the same is <eos> Everything changes, everything changes <eos> Sister calls herself a sexy grandma <eos> Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol <eos> Mama's out of touch with reality <eos> Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree <eos> As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> 
Heading down south to the land of the pines <eos> I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline <eos> Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights <eos> I made it down the coast in seventeen hours <eos> Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers <eos> And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Running from the cold up in New England <eos> I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band <eos> My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now <eos> Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down <eos> Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town <eos> But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Walking to the south out of Roanoke <eos> I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke <eos> But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap <eos> To Johnson City, Tennessee <eos> And I got to get a move on before the sun <eos> I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one <eos> And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> You can rock me <eos> Rock me <eos>

They say "Love is more precious than gold" <eos> Can't be bought and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> I got a woman with eyes that shine <eos> Down deep, as a diamond mine <eos> She's my treasure, so very rare <eos> She made me a millionaire <eos> When we ride around, ride around this old town <eos> In my beat-up car, with the windows down <eos> People look at her and they look at me <eos> And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury" <eos> Sweet luxury <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought no, never could be sold <eos> I got love, enough to share <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> When the kisses fall from everywhere <eos> Like riches on a millionaire <eos> When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare <eos> I still feel like a millionaire <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos>

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time <eos> I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now <eos> I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey <eos> And does he want you to be just a little more city? <eos> Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries <eos> I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel <eos> If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough <eos> I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby) <eos> If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right <eos> I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy) <eos> 'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find <eos> That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now <eos> No rush, but if he ever singles you up <eos> He hasn't even looked your way since you walked in (Walked in) <eos> But I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you <eos> Your favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along (Singing along) <eos> And he don't even know a single word <eos> If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough <eos> I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby) <eos> If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right <eos> I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy) <eos> 'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find <eos> That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now <eos> No rush, but if he ever singles you up <eos> If he ever singles you up <eos> I'ma be the first to call baby <eos> Sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries <eos> I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel <eos> If he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough <eos> I'ma be the first one calling you baby (Baby) <eos> If he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right <eos> I'ma be the first one calling him crazy (Crazy) <eos> 'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find <eos> That the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now <eos> No rush, but if he ever singles you up <eos> Oh, if he ever singles you up <eos> If he ever singles you up <eos> 
We say goodbye see you around <eos> We turn our backs then turn back around <eos> We break up we make up and we make love <eos> We can’t seem to let go girl <eos> So I’m comin' over <eos> Runnin' every red light <eos> To hell with the closure <eos> Save it for another time <eos> Try not to think about you <eos> But it ain’t workin' <eos> Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin' <eos> Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> I’m all alone, but you’re on my phone <eos> Tellin' me you miss me and that you’re at home <eos> Who knows what we are in the mornin' <eos> All I know is I want you <eos> So I’m comin' over <eos> Runnin' every red light <eos> To hell with the closure <eos> Save it for another time <eos> Try not to think about you <eos> But it ain’t workin' <eos> Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin' <eos> Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> Ooh, I’m comin' over <eos> Yeah we said that we’re done and I know that it’s late <eos> But you already know, I’m on my way <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> Runnin' every red light <eos> To hell with the closure <eos> Save it for another time <eos> Try not to think about you <eos> But it ain’t workin' <eos> Why put out a fire that’s burnin' <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> Runnin' every red light <eos> To hell with the closure <eos> Save it for another time <eos> Try not to think about you <eos> But it ain’t workin' <eos> Why put out a fire when it’s still burnin' <eos> Just when I think movin' on is gettin' closer <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> I’m comin' over <eos> 
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart <eos> But to movin' on is the hardest part <eos> It comes in waves, the letting go <eos> But the memory fades, everybody knows <eos> Everybody knows <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Maybe months go by, maybe years from now <eos> And I meet someone and it's workin' out <eos> Every now and then, he can see right through <eos> 'Cause when I look at him <eos> Yeah, all I  see is you <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> What if I never get over? <eos> What if I never get closure? <eos> What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya? <eos> What if It never gets better? <eos> What if this lasts forever and ever and ever? <eos> I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got? <eos> What if your love was my one and only shot? <eos> What if I end up with nothing to compare it to <eos> What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Oh, what if I never get over? <eos> Over you <eos> 
Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers" <eos> Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other <eos> He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name" <eos> We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos> Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me <eos> Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely? <eos> Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.? <eos> Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway? <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos> You'll find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought <eos> We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not <eos> Sometimes you got to <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos>

Lights go down, wheels go 'round <eos> I'm taking you home <eos> Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now <eos> I'm not ready to shut it down <eos> The way the dashboard glow <eos> Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind <eos> And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot <eos> Stop this car and throw it in park and just <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> (Slow dance in a parking lot) <eos> A half song gone, one door open, across the lot <eos> A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car <eos> Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time <eos> To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks <eos> You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman" <eos> And I don't care what song comes next <eos> I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> And get close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just <eos> A slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos>

I've never been one to ask for help <eos> If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself <eos> I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday <eos> Quote you the scripture kind <eos> I'm far from a preacher <eos> But I'm a believer <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> For someone to love me like you do <eos> Graceful eyes to see me through <eos> A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me <eos> A touch that kills me too <eos> And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> Every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain <eos> Girl, even today, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> 
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do <eos> Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed <eos> Watching you spin in that dress <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> I keep checking you for halos <eos> Swear you're an angel in disguise <eos> You poke my mind from every angle, and I <eos> I can see Heaven in your eyes <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for <eos> And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful <eos> Oh, baby <eos> 'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees) <eos> Whoa, you make me believe <eos> Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos>

You see that mountain over there? Yeah? <eos> Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn <eos> Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man <eos> Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend <eos> Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats <eos> Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats <eos> Play some back-home, come-on music <eos> That comes from the heart <eos> Play something with lots of feeling <eos> Because that's where music has to start <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> 
Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> When that sun is high in that Texas sky <eos> I'll be bucking at the county fair <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there <eos> They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe <eos> Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way <eos> Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate <eos> And I hope that judge ain't blind <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind <eos> Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine <eos> I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> 
You may think that I'm talking foolish <eos> You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free <eos> You may wonder how I can promise you now <eos> This love that I feel for you, always will be <eos> But you're not just time that I'm killing <eos> I'm no longer one of those guys <eos> As sure as I live, this love that I give <eos> Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen​ <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> I'll be happy to tell you again <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> They say that time takes its toll on a body <eos> Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey <eos> But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair <eos> And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway <eos> They say that time can play tricks on a memory <eos> Make people forget things they knew <eos> Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me <eos> I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> Well, just listen to how this song ends <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos>

Down on the corner by the traffic light <eos> Everybody's looking as she walks by <eos> They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> Up by the bus stop and across the street <eos> Open up their windows to take a peek <eos> Y'all she goes walking, rockin' like a rollin' stone <eos> Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> She can't help it if she's made that way <eos> She's not to blame if they look her way <eos> She ain't really trying to cause a scene <eos> It just comes naturally, ah Lord the girl can't help it <eos> Well up on Main Street by the taxi stand <eos> There's a crowd of people and a traffic jam <eos> But she don't look back, she ain't doing nothing wrong <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> She can't help it if she's made that way <eos> She's not to blame if they look her way <eos> She ain't really trying to cause a scene <eos> It just comes naturally, awww the girl can't help it <eos> Down on the corner by the traffic light <eos> Everybody's looking as she walks by <eos> They turn their heads and they watch her 'til she's gone <eos> Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on <eos> 
(Verse 1:  David Frizzell) <eos> There's a full moon over Tulsa <eos> I hope that it's shining on you <eos> The nights are getting cold <eos> In Cherokee County <eos> There's a Blue Norther passing through <eos> I remember green eyes and a rancher's daughter <eos> But remember is all that I do <eos> Losing you left a pretty good cowboy <eos> With nothing to hold on to <eos> Sundown came and I drove to town <eos> And drank a drink or two <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 2:  Shelly West) <eos> Here the city lights outshine the moon <eos> I was just now thinking of you <eos> Sometimes when the wind blows you can <eos> See the mountains <eos> And all the way to Malibu <eos> Everyone's a star here in L.A. County <eos> You ought to see the things that they do <eos> All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip <eos> Wish that they could be like you <eos> The Santa Monica Freeway <eos> Sometimes makes a country girl blue <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 3:  Both) <eos> I work 10 hours on a John Deere tractor <eos> Just thinking of you all day <eos> I've got a calico cat and a two-room flat <eos> On a street in West L.A <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos>

Wrote my whole life down in a notebook <eos> Songs about you and me <eos> I've been singing to every soul in Tennessee <eos> But nobody seems to listen <eos> And no one ever smiles the way that you do <eos> So I guess you'll never hear me on the radio <eos> And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine <eos> To hold you once more <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> I left home for Hollywood looking for a part to play <eos> Well, you always said I had such a pretty face <eos> But I guess I'm not that pretty <eos> 'Cause no one looks at me the way that you do <eos> Well, you'll always be a movie star to me <eos> And darlin', now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> Well, we're stuck here in these hills that they call mountains <eos> But darlin', back home in your arms is right where I want to be <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> 
Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Sometimes it feels like <eos> This world's gone crazy <eos> Grandpa, take me back to yesterday <eos> Where the line between right and wrong <eos> Didn't seem so hazy <eos> Did lovers really fall in love to stay <eos> Stand beside each other come what may? <eos> Was a promise really something people kept <eos> Not just something they would say? <eos> Did families really bow their heads to pray? <eos> Did daddies really never go away? <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Grandpa <eos> Everything is changing fast <eos> We call it progress <eos> But I just don't know <eos> And Grandpa, let's wonder back into the past <eos> And paint me a picture of long ago <eos> Did lovers really fall in love to stay <eos> Stand beside each other come what may? <eos> Was a promise really something people kept <eos> Not just something they would say and then forget? <eos> Did families really bow their heads to pray? <eos> Did daddies really never go away? <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good old days <eos> Whoa oh Grandpa <eos> Tell me 'bout the good ole days <eos> 
I don't believe in superstars <eos> Organic food and foreign cars <eos> I don't believe the price of gold <eos> The certainty of growing old <eos> That right is right and left is wrong <eos> That north and south can't get along <eos> That east is east and west is west <eos> And being first is always best <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos> Well I don't believe that heaven waits <eos> For only those who congregate <eos> I like to think of God as love <eos> He's down below, he's up above <eos> He's watchin' people, everywhere <eos> He knows who does and doesn't care <eos> And I'm an ordinary man <eos> Sometimes I wonder who I am <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in music <eos> I believe in magic <eos> And I believe in you <eos> I know with all my certainty <eos> What's going on with you and me <eos> Is a good thing <eos> It's true <eos> I believe in you <eos> I don't believe virginity <eos> Is as common as it used to be <eos> In working days and sleeping nights <eos> That black is black and white is white <eos> That Superman and Robin Hood <eos> Are still alive in Hollywood <eos> That gasoline's in short supply <eos> The rising cost of gettin' by <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in old folks <eos> I believe in children <eos> I believe in you <eos> I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos>

There's a lot of ways of saying <eos> What I want to say to you <eos> There's songs and poems and promises <eos> And dreams that might come true <eos> But I won't talk of starry skies <eos> Or moonlight on the ground <eos> I'll come right out and tell you <eos> I'd just love to lay you down <eos> Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear <eos> Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear <eos> I'll let you know how much it means just having you around <eos> Oh darling how I'd love to lay you down <eos> There's so many ways your sweet love's <eos> Made this house into a home <eos> You've got a way of doing <eos> Little things that turn me on <eos> Like standing in the kitchen <eos> In your faded cotton gown <eos> With your hair all up in curlers <eos> I still love to lay you down <eos> Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear <eos> Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear <eos> I'll let you know how much it means just having you around <eos> Oh darling how I love to lay you down <eos> When a whole lot of Decembers <eos> Are showing in your face <eos> Your auburn hair has faded <eos> And silver takes it's place <eos> You'll be just as lovely <eos> And I'll still be around <eos> And if I can I know that <eos> I'd still love to lay you down <eos> Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear <eos> Lay you down and tell you all the things a woman loves to hear <eos> I'll let you know how much it means just having you around <eos> Oh darling how I love to lay you down <eos> Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear <eos> Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear <eos> I'll let you know how much it means just having you around <eos> Oh darling how I love to lay you down <eos> Lay you down and softly whisper pretty love words in your ear <eos> Lay you down and tell you all the things my woman loves to hear <eos> I'll let you know how much it means just having you around <eos> Oh darling how I love to lay you down <eos>

Mary took to running with a travelling man <eos> Left her momma crying with her head in her hands <eos> Such a sad case, so broken hearted <eos> She say, momma, gotta go, gotta get outta here <eos> Gotta get outta town, tired of hanging around <eos> I gotta roll on between the ditches <eos> Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go <eos> 'Round and around, nobody knows <eos> But the highway goes on forever <eos> That ol' highway rolls on forever <eos> Lord, she never would’ve done it if she hadn't got drunk <eos> If she hadn't started running with a travelling man <eos> If she hadn't started taking those crazy chances <eos> She say, daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelling' kind <eos> Everywhere he's goin' such a very short time <eos> He'll be long gone before you know it <eos> He'll be long gone before you know it <eos> She say, never have I known it when it felt so good <eos> Never have I knew it when I knew I could <eos> Never have I done it when it looked so right <eos> Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight <eos> This is down in the swampland, anything goes <eos> It's alligator bait and the bars don't close <eos> It's the real thing down in Louisiana <eos> Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad <eos> When he really got trouble like a daughter goin’ bad <eos> It gets real hot down in Louisiana <eos> The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed <eos> He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will <eos> It ain't no time for lengthy speeches <eos> There ain't no time for lengthy speeches <eos> Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go <eos> 'Round and around nobody knows <eos> But the highway goes on forever <eos> That old highway rolls on forever <eos> 
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart <eos> Without saying a word you can light up the dark <eos> Try as I may I could never explain <eos> What I hear when you don't say a thing <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> All day long I can hear people talking out loud <eos> But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd <eos> Old Mister Webster could never define <eos> What's being said between your heart and mine <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> 
Well, it's Sunday morning <eos> And the sun in shining in my eye that is open <eos> And my head is spinning <eos> Was the life of the party <eos> I can't stop grinning <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Now wait a minute <eos> Things don't look to familiar <eos> Who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me? <eos> He's awful cute <eos> But how'd I get his shirt on? <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> All those little shooters <eos> How I love to drink 'em down <eos> Come on, bartender <eos> Let's have another round <eos> Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high <eos> Tomorrow might be painful <eos> But tonight we're gonna fly <eos> Did I start any fights? <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Every time we get together <eos> I sure have a good time <eos> You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo <eos> (Tequila) <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine <eos> 
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore <eos> But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before <eos> And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen <eos> And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans <eos> I asked her what's a woman like you doing here <eos> I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer <eos> She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem <eos> And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans <eos> She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls <eos> But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl <eos> So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream <eos> And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans <eos> We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through <eos> I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true <eos> As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed <eos> A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans <eos> In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say <eos> I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways <eos> And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen <eos> That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine <eos> But I know I’ll always remember the time <eos> A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream <eos> And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> 
In a little cabaret in a South Texas border town <eos> Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all around <eos> And all the girls from there to Austin <eos> Were slippin' away from home and puttin' jewelry in hock <eos> To take a trip to go and listen to the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Well he couldn't ride or wrangle <eos> And he never cared to make a dime <eos> But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the time <eos> And all the girls from nine to ninety <eos> Were snappin' fingers, tappin' toes, and beggin' him "don't stop" <eos> And hypnotized and fascinated by the little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him 'round <eos> He vanished like the breeze, they forgot him in the little town <eos> But all the girls still dreamed about him <eos> And hung around the cabaret until the doors were locked <eos> And then one day on the Hit Parade was a little dark-haired boy <eos> Who played the Tennessee flat-top box <eos> And he would play: <eos> 
He said "I'll love you til I die" <eos> She told him "you'll forget in time" <eos> As the years went slowly by <eos> She still preyed upon his mind <eos> He kept her picture on his wall <eos> Went half crazy now and then <eos> But he still loved her through it all <eos> Hoping she'd come back again <eos> He kept some letters by his bed <eos> Dated 1962 <eos> He had underlined in red <eos> Every single 'I love you' <eos> I went to see him just today <eos> Oh but I didn't see no tears <eos> All dressed up to go away <eos> First time I'd seen him smile in years <eos> He stopped loving her today <eos> They placed a wreath upon his door <eos> And soon they'll carry him away <eos> He stopped loving her today <eos> You know she came to see him one last time <eos> Oh, and we all wondered if she would <eos> And it kept runnin' through my mind <eos> This time - he's over her for good <eos> He stopped loving her today <eos> They placed a wreath upon his door <eos> And soon they'll carry him away <eos> He stopped loving her today <eos> 
Lord I hope this day is good I'm feeling empty and misunderstood <eos> I should be thankful Lord I know I should but Lord I hope this day is good <eos> Lord have you forgotten me I've been prayin' to you faithfully <eos> I'm not saying I'm a righteous man but Lord I hope you understand <eos> I don't need fortune and I don't need fame <eos> Send down the thunder Lord send down the rain <eos> But when you're planning just how it will be plan a good day for me <eos> Lord I hope this day is good... <eos> You've been the King since the dawn of time all that I'm asking is a little less cryin' <eos> It might be hard for the devil to do but it would be easy for you <eos> Lord I hope this day is good... <eos> 
Hey pretty baby, are you ready for me? <eos> Yeah it's your good rocking daddy down from Tennessee <eos> I'm just out of Austin, bound for San Antone <eos> With the radio blasting and the bird dog on <eos> There's a speed trap up ahead in Selma Town <eos> But no local yokel gonna shut me down <eos> Because me and my boys got this rig unwound <eos> And we've come a thousand miles from a Guitar Town <eos> Nothing ever happened around my hometown <eos> And I ain't the kind to just hang around <eos> But I heard someone calling my name one day <eos> And I followed that voice down the lost highway <eos> Everybody told me you can't get far <eos> On thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar <eos> Now I'm smokin' into Texas with the hammer down <eos> And a rocking little combo from the Guitar Town <eos> Hey pretty baby, don't you know it ain't my fault? <eos> I love to hear the steel belts humming on the asphalt <eos> Wake up in the middle of the night in a truck stop <eos> Stumble in the restaurant wondering why I don't stop <eos> Well I got to keep rocking while I still can <eos> I got a two pack habit and a motel tan <eos> When my boots hit the boards, I'm a brand new man <eos> With my back to the riser, I make my stand <eos> Hey pretty baby, won't you hold me tight? <eos> I'm loading up and rolling out of here tonight <eos> One of these days I'm gonna settle down <eos> And take you back with me to the Guitar Town <eos> 
Our paths may never cross again <eos> Maybe my heart will never mend <eos> But I'm glad for all the good times <eos> Cause you've brought me so much sunshine <eos> And love was the best it's ever been <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> Wouldn't have missed loving you girl <eos> You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile <eos> I wouldn't trade one memory <eos> Cause you mean too much to me <eos> Even though I lost you girl <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> They say that all good things must end <eos> Loves comes and goes just like the wind <eos> You've got your dreams to follow <eos> But if I had the chance tomorrow <eos> You know I'd do it all again <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> Wouldn't have missed loving you girl <eos> You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile <eos> I wouldn't trade one memory <eos> Cause you mean too much to me <eos> Even though I lost you girl <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> Oh I wouldn't trade one memory <eos> Cause you mean too much to me <eos> Even though I lost you girl <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos> Wouldn't have missed loving you girl <eos> You've made my whole life worth while, with your smile <eos> I wouldn't trade one memory <eos> Cause you mean too much to me <eos> Even though I lost you girl <eos> I wouldn't have missed it for the world <eos>

It's knowin' that your door is always open <eos> And your path is free to walk <eos> That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag <eos> Rolled up and stashed behind your couch <eos> And it's knowin' I'm not shackled <eos> By forgotten words and bonds <eos> And the ink stains that have dried upon some line <eos> That keeps you in the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> That keeps you ever gentle on my mind <eos> It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy <eos> Planted on their columns now that bind me <eos> Or something that somebody said because <eos> They thought we fit together walkin' <eos> It's just knowing that the world <eos> Will not be cursing or forgiving <eos> When I walk along some railroad track and find <eos> That you're movin' on the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> And for hours you're just gentle on my mind <eos> Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines <eos> And the junkyards and the highways come between us <eos> And some other woman's cryin' to her mother <eos> 'Cause she turned and I was gone <eos> I still might run in silence <eos> Tears of joy might stain my face <eos> And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind <eos> But not to where I cannot see <eos> You walkin' on the back roads <eos> By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind <eos> I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron <eos> In some train yard <eos> My beard a rustlin' coal pile <eos> And a dirty hat pulled low across my face <eos> Through cupped hands 'round a tin can <eos> I pretend to hold you to my breast and find <eos> That you're waitin' from the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind <eos> 
The lights in the harbor <eos> Don't shine for me <eos> I'm like a lost ship <eos> Adrift on the sea <eos> Yeah, the sea of heartbreak <eos> Lost love and loneliness <eos> Memories of your caress so divine <eos> How I wish you were mine <eos> Again my dear <eos> I'm on this sea of tears <eos> Sea of heartbreak <eos> Oh, how did I lose you <eos> Oh, where did I fail <eos> Why did you leave me <eos> Always to sail <eos> Yeah, the sea of heartbreak <eos> Lost love and loneliness <eos> Memories of your caress so divine <eos> How I wish you were mine <eos> Again my dear <eos> I'm on this sea of tears <eos> Sea of heartbreak <eos> Oh, what I'd give just to sail back to shore <eos> Back to your arms once more <eos> Oh, come to my rescue <eos> Come here to me <eos> Take me and keep me <eos> Away from the sea <eos> Yeah, the sea of heartbreak <eos> Lost love and loneliness <eos> Memories of your caress so divine <eos> How I wish you were mine <eos> Again my dear <eos> I'm on this sea of tears <eos> Sea of heartbreak <eos> (Sea of heartbreak) <eos> Yeah, sea of heartbreak <eos> (Sea of heartbreak) <eos> Heartbreak <eos> 
I wanna tell you all the story 'bout <eos> A Harper Valley widowed  wife <eos> Who had a teenage daughter <eos> Who attended Harper Valley Junior High <eos> Well her daughter came home one afternoon <eos> And didn't even stop to play <eos> And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well the note said Mrs. Johnson <eos> You're wearin' your dresses way too high <eos> It's reported you've been drinking <eos> And a-running round with men and goin' wild <eos> And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up <eos> Your little girl this way <eos> And it was signed by the Secretary <eos> Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet <eos> That very afternoon <eos> And they were sure surprised <eos> When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room <eos> And as she walked up to the blackboard <eos> I can still recall the words she had to say <eos> She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there <eos> And seven times he asked me for a date <eos> And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice <eos> Whenever he's away <eos> And Mr. Baker can you tell us why <eos> Your secretary had to leave this town? <eos> And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep <eos> Her window shades all pulled completely down <eos> Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here <eos> 'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again <eos> And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath <eos> You'll find she's had a little nip of gin <eos> And then you have the nerve to tell me <eos> You think that as a mother I'm not fit <eos> Well this is just a little Peyton Place <eos> And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites <eos> No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did <eos> It happened just this way <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos> 
Well I pulled outta Pittsburgh <eos> A rollin' down that Eastern Seaboard <eos> I got my diesel wound up <eos> And she's a runnin' like a never before <eos> There's a speed zone ahead, well alright <eos> I don't see a cop in sight <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> I got me ten forward gears <eos> And a Georgia overdrive <eos> I'm takin' little white pills <eos> And my eyes are open wide <eos> I just passed a Jimmy and a White <eos> I been a passin' everything in sight <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> Well it seems like a month <eos> Since I kissed my baby goodbye <eos> I coulda had a lotta women <eos> But I'm not like a some other guys <eos> I could find one to hold me tight <eos> But I could never make believe it's alright <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> ICC is a checkin' on down the line <eos> Well I'm a little overweight <eos> And my log book's way behind <eos> But nothin' bothers me tonight <eos> I can dodge all the scales alright <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> Well my rig's a little old <eos> But that don't mean she's slow <eos> There's a flame from her stack <eos> And that smoke's a blowin' black as coal <eos> My hometown's a comin' in sight <eos> If you think I'm a happy, you're right <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> Six days on the road <eos> And I'm a gonna make it home tonight <eos> 
Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin' for the trains feelin' nearly faded as my jeans <eos> Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to New Orleans <eos> I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana <eos> And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues <eos> With them windshield whipers slappin' time <eos> And Bobby clappin' hands we finally sang up every song that driver knew <eos> Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose <eos> Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free <eos> Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues <eos> Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee <eos> From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun <eos> Bobby shared the secrets of my soul <eos> Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done <eos> And every night she kept me from the cold <eos> Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away <eos> Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find <eos> I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday holdin' Bobby's body next to mine <eos> Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose <eos> Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free <eos> Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues <eos> Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee <eos> La la la la la... <eos>

The first thing I remember knowing <eos> Was a lonesome whistle blowing <eos> And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride <eos> On a freight train leaving town <eos> Not knowing where I'm bound <eos> And no one could change my mind but mama tried <eos> One and only rebel child <eos> From a family meek and mild <eos> My mama seemed to know what lay in store <eos> Despite all my Sunday learning <eos> Towards the bad I kept on turning <eos> 'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore <eos> And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole <eos> No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried <eos> Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied <eos> That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried <eos> Dear old daddy, rest his soul <eos> Left my mom a heavy load <eos> She tried so very hard to fill his shoes <eos> Working hours without rest <eos> Wanted me to have the best <eos> She tried to raise me right but I refused <eos> And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole <eos> No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried <eos> Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied <eos> That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried <eos> 
I remember when I was a lad <eos> Times were hard and things were bad <eos> But there's a silver lining behind every cloud <eos> Just poor people, that's all we were <eos> Trying to make a living out of black land dirt <eos> We'd get together in a family circle singing loud <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> Singing seems to help a troubled soul <eos> One of these days and it won't be long <eos> I'll rejoin them in a song <eos> I'm going to join the family circle at the throne <eos> No, the circle won't be broken <eos> By and by, Lord, by and by <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Now I remember after work <eos> Mama would call in all of us <eos> You could hear us singing for a country mile <eos> Now little brother has done gone on <eos> But, I'll rejoin him in a song <eos> We'll be together again up yonder in a little while <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Songwriter:  Carl Perkins <eos> 
I fall to pieces <eos> Each time I see you again <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> How can I be just your friend? <eos> You want me to act like we've never kissed <eos> You want me to forget (to forget) <eos> Pretend we've never met (never met) <eos> And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name) <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Time only adds to the flame <eos> You tell me to find someone else to love <eos> Someone who'll love me too (love me too) <eos> The way you used to do (used to do) <eos> But each time I go out with someone new <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> 
I'm five hundred miles away from home <eos> Teardrops fell on mama's note when I read the things she wrote <eos> She said we miss you son we love you come on home <eos> Well I didn't have to pack I had it all right on my back <eos> Now I'm five hundred miles away from home <eos> Away from home, away from home <eos> Cold and tired and all alone <eos> Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home <eos> I know this is the same road I took the day I left home but it sure looks different now <eos> Well I guess I look different too 'cause time changes everything <eos> I wonder what they'll say when they see their boy looking this way <eos> Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home <eos> Can't remember when I ate it's just thumb and walk and wait <eos> And I'm still five hundred miles away from home <eos> If my luck had been just right I'd be with them all tonight <eos> But I'm still five hundred miles away from home <eos> Away from home, away from home <eos> Cold and tired and all alone <eos> Yes I'm five hundred miles away from home <eos> Lord I'm still five hundred miles away from home <eos> 
I told Mary about us <eos> I told her about our great sin <eos> Mary cried and forgave me <eos> And Mary took me back again <eos> Said if I wanted my freedom <eos> I could be free evermore <eos> But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see <eos> Mary cry anymore <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Mary is waitin' and weepin' <eos> Down in our shack by the sea <eos> Even after I've hurt her <eos> Mary' still in love with me <eos> Devil woman it's over <eos> Trapped no more by your charms <eos> Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away <eos> Woman let go of my arm <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Devil woman you're evil <eos> Like the dark coral reef <eos> Like the winds that bring high tides <eos> You bring sorrow and grief <eos> You made me ashamed to face Mary <eos> Barely had the strength to tell <eos> Skies are not so black, Mary took me back <eos> Mary has broken your spell <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Runnin' along by the seashore <eos> Runnin' as fast as I can <eos> Even the seagulls are happy <eos> Glad I'm coming home again <eos> Never again will I ever <eos> Cause another tear to fall <eos> Down the beach I see, what belongs to me <eos> The one I want most of all <eos> Oh, devil woman, devil woman <eos> Don't follow me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I'm going back home <eos> 
Sometimes it's hard to be a woman <eos> Giving all your love to just one man <eos> You'll have bad times <eos> And he'll have good times <eos> Doin' things that you don't understand <eos> But if you love him <eos> You'll forgive him <eos> Even though he's hard to understand <eos> And if you love him <eos> Oh, be proud of him <eos> 'Cause after all, he's just a man <eos> Stand by your man <eos> Give him two arms to cling to <eos> And something warm to come to <eos> When nights are cold and lonely <eos> Stand by your man <eos> And show the world you love him <eos> Keep giving all the love you can <eos> Stand by your man <eos> Stand by your man <eos> And show the world you love him <eos> Keep giving all the love you can <eos> Stand by your man <eos> 
Crazy <eos> I'm crazy for feeling so lonely <eos> I'm crazy <eos> Crazy for feeling so blue <eos> I knew <eos> You'd love me as long as you wanted <eos> And then some day <eos> You'd leave me for somebody new <eos> Worry <eos> Why do I let myself worry? <eos> Wondering <eos> What in the world did I do? <eos> Oh, crazy <eos> For thinking that my love could hold you <eos> I'm crazy for trying <eos> And crazy for crying <eos> And I'm crazy for loving you <eos> Crazy <eos> For thinking that my love could hold you <eos> I'm crazy for trying <eos> And crazy for crying <eos> And I'm crazy for loving you <eos>

I wanna go home, I wanna go home <eos> Oh, how I wanna go home <eos> Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City <eos> And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home <eos> I dreamed about my mother dear, old papa, sister and brother <eos> I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long <eos> I wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home <eos> Homefolks think I'm big in Detroit City <eos> From the letters that I write they think I'm fine <eos> But by day I make the cars, by night I make the bars <eos> If only they could read between the lines <eos> Cause you know I rode the freight train north to Detroit City <eos> And after all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time <eos> So I just think I'll take my foolish pride <eos> And put it on a Southbound freight and ride <eos> And go on back to the loved ones, the ones that I left waitin' so far behind <eos> I wanna go home, I wanna go home <eos> Oh, how I wanna go home... <eos> 
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true <eos> Or is he holding you the way I do? <eos> Though love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know <eos> Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go? <eos> You can't say the words I want to hear <eos> While you're with another man <eos> Do you want me, answer yes or no <eos> Darling, I will understand <eos> Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> 
You left me for the bright lights of the town <eos> A country boy set out to see the world <eos> Remember when those city lights shine down <eos> That big old moon shines on your Kentucky Girl <eos> I swear, I love you by the moon above you <eos> How bright is it shining in your world? <eos> Some morning when you wake up all alone <eos> Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl <eos> Don't wait to bring great riches home to me <eos> I need no diamond ring or fancy pearls <eos> Just bring yourself you're all I'll ever need <eos> That's good enough for this blue Kentucky Girl <eos> I swear, I love you by stars above you <eos> How bright is it shining in your world? <eos> Some morning when you wake up all alone <eos> Just come on home to your blue Kentucky Girl <eos>

She don't know she's that girl <eos> That turns me on, wrecks my world <eos> With a little smile <eos> I bet I told her a thousand times <eos> She don't hear 'em when they talk about her <eos> Yet I hear 'em all sayin', "Who's that guy <eos> And what did he do right?" <eos> Yeah, when I tell her she don't need makeup <eos> She's just perfect when she wakes up <eos> She thinks I'm lyin' <eos> Oh, but I ain't lyin' <eos> She don't know I lay beside her <eos> Late at night and wonder why she'd <eos> Settle for a guy like me <eos> That I can't live without her, dreamed about her <eos> Way before I ever found her <eos> Made a better man out of me <eos> Oh, she don't even know she's perfect <eos> All her love, I don't deserve it <eos> She could have any heart she wants to hold <eos> Oh, but she don't know <eos> She don't know I still remember <eos> What she wore the night I met her <eos> Little white tee and some torn-up jeans <eos> She don't know I taste that first kiss <eos> Every time I land on her lips <eos> I'm right there in that midnight air <eos> She don't know that I'm still wishin' <eos> On every star up there that'll listen <eos> Sayin', "Don't let her go (Don't let her go) <eos> Oh, please don't let her go" <eos> She don't know I lay beside her <eos> Late at night and wonder why she'd <eos> Settle for a guy like me <eos> That I can't live without her, dreamed about her <eos> Way before I ever found her <eos> Made a better man out of me <eos> Oh, she don't even know she's perfect <eos> All her love, I don't deserve it <eos> She could have any heart she wants to hold <eos> Oh, but she don't know <eos> She don't know <eos> She don't know <eos> No, no <eos> She don't know I lay beside her <eos> Late at night and wonder why she'd <eos> Settle for a guy like me <eos> That I can't live without her, dreamed about her <eos> Way before I ever found her <eos> Made a better man out of me <eos> Oh, she don't even know she's perfect <eos> All her love, I don't deserve it <eos> She could have any heart she wants to hold <eos> Oh, but she don't know <eos> She don't know <eos> She don't know <eos> No, no <eos> Oh, she don't know she's perfect <eos> Her love, I don't deserve it <eos> But she don't know <eos> She don't know <eos> 
Well, I just don't get it <eos> Hell, I just don't see <eos> How one five-foot-two blue-eyed girl <eos> Could wreck a guy like me <eos> So here I am on a back porch <eos> It's looking like I'm stuck <eos> 'Tween a case of Rolling Rock and a heartache <eos> It's gonna be the end of one of us <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> She might have my UT hoodie <eos> She got the last word in that goodbye <eos> But I'm killing these cans 'cause I'll be damned <eos> If she's gonna get my Saturday night <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> Can down <eos> There's one more buried down deep in that ice <eos> But I'm leaving no can left behind, so I <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> Can down <eos> (Can down) <eos> (Can down) <eos> 
Well, we were down in Austin, Texas <eos> At the Hang 'em High Saloon <eos> Hitting the bars, pickin' on guitars <eos> And singin' out country tunes <eos> When some third-string Longhorn quarterback <eos> Said he wanted a piece of Wade <eos> Well, when it's two for one <eos> It's one for all <eos> So I jumped down off that stage <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm bulletproof <eos> Ten feet tall when I'm drinkin' <eos> Get to thinkin' that I'm Superman <eos> So you stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Yeah, this one time, we were out in L.A. <eos> Shuttin' down the Sunset Strip <eos> We were sippin' on bubbles <eos> Lookin' for some trouble <eos> When a supermodel strutted on in <eos> Yeah, Randy told me, "That girl is famous" <eos> She's way, way over your head <eos> I bet you five hundred <eos> You can't get her number <eos> So I just smiled and said: <eos> Hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> Let me show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> Well, I'm a Prince Charmin', Casanova <eos> Don Juan, Romeo <eos> A smooth talkin' ladies' man <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> Well, good friends and bad decisions <eos> Just go hand in hand <eos> And it's good to know you got somebody <eos> Who's got your back <eos> And got your can <eos> Here, hold this man, you know what I'm talkin' about <eos> Oh, man! <eos> Yeah, well hold my beer <eos> This won't take long <eos> Step back, son <eos> And let us show you <eos> Just how it's done <eos> So don't be fakin' <eos> It's okay to be drinkin' <eos> And I'm gonna want it back again <eos> You stay here <eos> And hold my beer <eos> No, no, man <eos> You stay here <eos> Yeah, and hold my beer <eos> I got you, little buddy <eos> Good luck with that <eos> 
I've tried and I can't <eos> Outrun the rain <eos> I've gotta weather it <eos> Can't hide, can't duck <eos> Under every punch <eos> I've gotta roll with it <eos> I could bitch and moan <eos> Or get up and go on <eos> Takin' as it comes, learnin' as I go <eos> Can't hold on to somethin' that's outta my control <eos> Gonna let the day roll, roll into another one <eos> I'm takin' it as it comes <eos> I've spent a lotta time <eos> Tryna rewind life <eos> Or fast forward it <eos> Wishin' I could hit <eos> Pause and take in <eos> A little more of it <eos> It's all said and done <eos> I can't do either one, so I'm <eos> Takin' as it comes, learnin' as I go <eos> Can't hold on to somethin' that's outta my control <eos> Gonna let the day roll, roll into another one <eos> I'm takin' it as it comes <eos> I'm takin' it as it comes <eos> Lеarnin' as I go <eos> I'm takin' as it comes, learnin' as I go <eos> Can't hold on to somethin' that's outta my control <eos> Takin' as it comеs, learnin' as I go <eos> Can't hold on to somethin' that's outta my control <eos> Gonna let the day roll, roll into another one <eos> I'm takin' it as it comes <eos> I'm takin' it as it comes <eos> 
Eyes like the pools of the Frio River where it ripples over smooth grey stones <eos> Hair that shone like your Palomino silhouetted when the fields turn gold <eos> And you show me shades of beauty I had missed <eos> When I come here I always see you like this <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Well the stars burn bright on a moonless night black watеr goes slippin' past the bridge <eos> Smеll the rain roll in on a cool west wind hear the coyotes yippin' on the ridge <eos> And I think it might be time to sell this place <eos> And go somewhere where I might forget your face <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> If I had the chance to see how much you've changed <eos> Would your hair blow free when you lift your eyes? <eos> Would they be the same? <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> 
Yeah, I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Pulling away from all my sins <eos> Tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> I don't wanna leave you lonely but I've got to <eos> 'Cause it's only the things I need to prove <eos> To you and everybody else <eos> That scares me so damn much <eos> I can't take it I'm not strong <eos> It's probably best that I move on <eos> Get outta here, fade away <eos> That's why I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> And tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Everybody's gotta die somehow <eos> Why not for me right now, right now <eos> Well, I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Drunk driving again <eos> I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> Tell my mother I lovе her and take care of my friеnds <eos> 'Cause I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Yeah, I'm drunk driving again <eos> 
Just like that neon sign, I'm buzzing <eos> Just like that full moon, I'm so high <eos> No, it's not what you think, it's not from the drink <eos> It's not from something I'm smoking <eos> Makes me feel like I can fly <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> When I fall and hit rock bottom <eos> When my star comes crashing to the ground <eos> My soft place to land, my steady right hand <eos> You make it all good, you make me feel like a man <eos> You lift me up, you never let me down <eos> Lord knows that you never let me down <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, all my dreams come true <eos> Come morning light waking up next to you, right next to you <eos> Soft candle light, California red <eos> I can't keep my boots on the ground tonight when they're underneath your bed, baby <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, you're looking so fine, you got me up on cloud nine <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Come on kiss me and then, kiss me again and again <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> 
What good's a highway without a destination? <eos> What good's a house without someone to come home to? <eos> What's a night at the top of the world without you there beside me? <eos> No, there ain't no good in it without you <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos> Still got the tendency to lean over the edges <eos> I still got the urge to chase the dream until it ends <eos> You don't fence me in <eos> Yeah, you understand <eos> But when I can't remember <eos> You remind me who I am <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Follow me, I need you right now <eos> Cover me up <eos> And settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos> 
Well, I don’t know what happens when we go <eos> But I hear that the streets are paved in gold <eos> And maybe there’s a little red dirt for my soul <eos> And maybe, just maybe the beer’s still cold <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> Well, I wonder if that light at the end is neon <eos> And I sure hope there’s a barstool for me to be on <eos> Give me Hank, give me Cash, give me Merle, give me Jones <eos> I know where I’m going when I’m home <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> That’s where I’ll be <eos> 
You never said nothing about LA <eos> Well I got here on a hot day <eos> Took a look around said well now nobody here looks like you anyway <eos> Told me Ventura's the place so I rented a place <eos> Stuck a handful of flowers in a Goodwill vase <eos> Said right out loud girl you're home 'n' this is what it feels like all alone <eos> You ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch <eos> And you ain't in this kitchen draggin' all the dishes out <eos> You won't ever walk this hall never make this bed <eos> I got you out of my heart after all <eos> Too bad you're in my head <eos> You never said nothing about leaving now every Tuesday feels like  <eos> Try not to think about it talk about it <eos> It's usually Friday before I'm feeling <eos> Good enough to wander round town <eos> Find nobody and just hang out now <eos> But it's under my skin keeps creepin' in it's haunting me I still can't believe that <eos> I ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch <eos> And I ain't in this kitchen draggin' all the dishes out <eos> I ain't ever walk this hall I never made this bed <eos> Oh I got you out of my heart after all <eos> Too bad you're in my head <eos> Oh I could call <eos> Hey I won't answer <eos> Is this all? <eos> I think it is <eos> Well then I know it is <eos> We ain't in this living room asleep on the old green couch <eos> We ain't in this kitchen draggin' all the dishes out <eos> We won't ever walk this hall mess up this king-size bed <eos> I got you out of my heart after all <eos> Too bad you're in my head <eos> Oh I got you out of my heart after all <eos> Too bad you're in my head <eos> You never said nothing about LA <eos> 
If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight <eos> Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled <eos> Who needs someone to hold you tight <eos> You know I'd love to be the one you always run to <eos> But if you only want me once in a blue moon <eos> You can tell me, baby, it's alright <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> I know we just met tonight <eos> So I don't wanna jump the gun <eos> But you're lettin' me spin you around <eos> I'm likin' you, might be the one <eos> I don't know the book on you <eos> But I'd like to turn every page <eos> Or maybe we can write our own love story <eos> But it's okay... <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight <eos> Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled <eos> Need someone to hold you tight <eos> You know I'd love to be the one you always run to <eos> But if you only want me once in a blue moon <eos> You can tell me, baby, it's alright <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> And you can have whatever you want <eos> Baby, long as you're with me <eos> And I'm gonna roll out the red carpet for you <eos> And treat you like royalty <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> If all you wanna do is burn a little moonlight <eos> Be my little temporary angel, diamond star spangled <eos> Need someone to hold you tight <eos> You know I'd love to be the one you always run to <eos> But if you only want me once in a blue moon <eos> You can tell me, baby, it's alright <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> Yeah, you can tell me, baby, it's alright <eos> If you just wanna be queen for a night <eos> 
I like the shades you're wearing and I like your new tattoo <eos> I see you went and dyed your hair and got a new perfume <eos> I shouldda known you'd be here dancin' to a fiddle song <eos> Kickin' up dust and stirring up mem'ries, blurring lines between right and wrong <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a lightening strike sheds light on falling rain <eos> Some things never change <eos> I feel there's still a sliver of my old love-lorn soul <eos> Tangled inside your heart that I lost long ago <eos> Cause longin' don't seem to matter how many years go by <eos> You and me we fit together we don't even have to try <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a bonfire fades when it runs out of flame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Will the way you feel remain the same? <eos> They say true love finds a way <eos> No the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> And I'll be by myself as the sun shines on my shame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> 
You said that I drank too much <eos> The tattoos on my skin are not your style <eos> You didn't like cigarettes on my kiss <eos> Well I hope that's something you miss <eos> Cause I'm not slowing down for awhile <eos> I've been desperate to fix what we've been <eos> Somethings need to stay broken <eos> Realize you're not worth me trying to hide <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> Want you so bad that I couldn't see <eos> The truth was sitting there in front of me <eos> It's never love, it was never real <eos> You wanted something to fix not something to feel <eos> But I am not your accessory <eos> I am not a Marie Annette for your passenger seat <eos> A lesson learned and now I'm free <eos> Well your green eyes look like shit to me <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> So won't you go on and marry that lady <eos> Wears Louis Vuitton, drives around in her Mercedes <eos> Says, "Downtown Dallas is the place to be" <eos> Daddy gave her everything that she's got for free <eos> She looks real good with her head down low <eos> Always minds her business in your shadow <eos> Kisses your ass like you wanted me to <eos> Well good luck honey he's all for you <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> 
I've been trying to find a way to tell you <eos> That I don't hurt no more <eos> I'm feeling sorry 'bout the things I said <eos> But I won't take them back, oh no <eos> Was it something that you want to <eos> Something that you need to get off your chest? <eos> I'm on a southbound train <eos> And it ain't lookin' good from here <eos> Now I'm driving down the highway losing my mind <eos> It's more than I have to give <eos> There ain't no other reason to let you fall <eos> So I just give in <eos> But if it's so damn hard for you to let me go <eos> Then just let me know <eos> 'Cause I'll be lonely <eos> Peace of mind, it's already moved on <eos> Well, I've been trying to find a way to let you know <eos> I've been alright <eos> It's good to know at the end of the day <eos> That I can sleep at night <eos> Was it something that you want to <eos> Somеthing that you need to get off your chest? <eos> I'm on a southbound train <eos> And it ain't lookin' good from herе <eos> 'Cause when I'm driving down the highway losing my mind <eos> It's more than I have to give <eos> There ain't no other reason to let you fall <eos> So I just give in <eos> But if it's so damn hard foryou to let me go <eos> Then just let me know <eos> 'Cause I'll be lonely <eos> Peace of mind, it's already moved on <eos> You ain't never gonna change <eos> You ain't never gonna change <eos> You ain't never gonna change <eos> You ain't never gonna change, oh no <eos> You ain't never gonna change <eos> You ain't never gonna change, oh no <eos> 'Cause when I'm driving down the highway losing my mind <eos> It's more than I have to give <eos> There ain't no other reason to let you fall <eos> So I just give in <eos> But if it's so damn hard foryou to let me go <eos> Then just let me know <eos> 'Cause I'll be lonely <eos> Peace of mind, it's already moved on <eos> Yeah, I'm already gone <eos> 
Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye <eos> You wanna go, then baby, just leave <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> You said my life was too fucked up to be with you <eos> But here you go to the bar 'til 2 <eos> I wanna know what he has that I don't <eos> Well, I was ready for the real thing <eos> No more shame in this life I live 'cause I would change for you <eos> Don't know the hope you gave to me <eos> But I guess that I'm okay, just need some cocaine <eos> And a bottle that'll float my mind <eos> And take a trip to another world where you would be mine <eos> Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye <eos> You wanna go, then baby, just leave <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> I found a couple of your long hairs in the passenger seat <eos> Where you looked over, smiled at me <eos> Guess a picture ain't worth as many words as they say <eos> And don't tell me that it's okay, I'll find my own way <eos> Don't need your excuse to ease my pain <eos> Guess it's just time for me to work on me <eos> Well, I don't wanna hear the good side, there ain't no good side <eos> You ain't never gonna see what I see <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> 
Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> And tell me, have you found a new man? <eos> Tell me, have you moved on? <eos> 'Cause me, I'm gettin' tired <eos> And this road, it's gettin' hard <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> And it's a fucked up situation I put us in <eos> When the woman I left you for left me for another man <eos> And I guess I should apologize <eos> But I never could lay down my pride <eos> 'Cause it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> Oh <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back <eos> Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend <eos> And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when <eos> I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on <eos> But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone <eos> When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son <eos> Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns" <eos> But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die <eos> When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry <eos> I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car <eos> They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars <eos> Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free <eos> But those people keep a-movin' <eos> And that's what tortures me <eos> Well if they freed me from this prison <eos> If that railroad train was mine <eos> I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line <eos> Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay <eos> And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away <eos> 
As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing <eos> The tune about the wild side of life <eos> As I listen to the words you are saying <eos> It brings memories when I was a trusting wife <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> It's a shame that all the blame is on us women <eos> It's not true that only you men feel the same <eos> From the start most every heart that's ever broken <eos> Was because there always was a man to blame <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos>

(Honeycomb) <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> Well it's a darn good life <eos> And it's kinda funny <eos> How the Lord made the bee <eos> And the bee made the honey <eos> And the honeybee lookin' for a home <eos> And they called it honeycomb <eos> And they roamed the world and they gathered all <eos> Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball <eos> And the honeycomb from a million trips <eos> Made my baby's lips <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord said now that I made a bee <eos> I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree <eos> And He made a little tree and I guess you heard <eos> What then, well, he made a little bird <eos> And they waited all around till the end of Spring <eos> Gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing <eos> And they put 'em all into one sweet tome <eos> For my Honeycomb <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord says now that I made a bird <eos> I'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word <eos> That sounds about sweet like "turtledove" <eos> And I guess I'm gonna call it "love" <eos> And He roamed the world lookin' everywhere <eos> Gettin' love from here, love from there <eos> And He put it all in a little ol' part <eos> Of my baby's heart <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> 
The cattle are prowlin' <eos> The coyotes are howlin' <eos> Way out where the doggies roam <eos> Where spurs are a jinglin' <eos> And the cowboy is singing <eos> His lonesome cattle call <eos> He rides in the sun <eos> 'Til his days work is done <eos> And he rounds up the cattle each fall <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> For hours he would ride <eos> On the range far and wide <eos> When the night wind blows up and slow <eos> His heart is a feather <eos> In all kinds of weather <eos> He sings his cattle call <eos> He's browned as a fairy <eos> From ridin' the prairie <eos> And he sings with an western drawl <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> 
I go out walking after midnight <eos> Out in the moonlight just like we used to do <eos> I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you <eos> I walk for miles along the highway <eos> Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you <eos> I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you <eos> I stopped to see a weeping willow <eos> Crying on his pillow <eos> Maybe he's crying for me <eos> And as the skies turn gloomy <eos> Night winds whisper to me <eos> I'm lonesome as I can be <eos> I go out walking after midnight <eos> Out in the starlight <eos> Just hoping you may be somewhere walking <eos> After midnight searching for me <eos> I stopped to see a weeping willow <eos> Crying on his pillow <eos> Maybe he's crying for me <eos> And as the skies turn gloomy <eos> Night winds whisper to me <eos> I'm lonesome as I can be <eos> I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight <eos> Just hoping maybe you're somewhere <eos> Walking after midnight, searching for me <eos>

Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos> 
I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop <eos> I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox <eos> But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone <eos> Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home? <eos> I'm livin' fast and dangerously, but I've got plenty of company <eos> When the moon comes up and the sun goes down <eos> That's when I wanna see the lights of town <eos> 'cause I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop <eos> I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox <eos> But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone <eos> Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home? <eos> I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop <eos> I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox <eos> But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone <eos> Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home? <eos> It takes a purty little gal and a jug of wine <eos> That's what it takes to make a honky-tonk mind <eos> With the jukebox a moanin', a honky-tonk sound <eos> That's when I wanna lay my money down <eos> I'm a honky-tonk man, and I can't seem to stop <eos> I love to give the girls a whirl, to the music of an old jukebox <eos> But when my money's all gone, I'm on the telephone <eos> Callin' hey hey mama, can your daddy come home? <eos> 
Heartache number one was when you left me <eos> I never knew that I could hurt this way <eos> And heartache number two was when you came back again <eos> You came back and never meant to stay <eos> Now I've got heartaches by the number, troubles by the score <eos> Every day you love me less <eos> Each day I love you more <eos> Yes, I've got heartaches by the number, a love that I can't win <eos> But the day that I'll stop counting <eos> That's the day my world would end <eos> Heartache number three was when you called me <eos> And said that you were coming back to stay <eos> With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door <eos> I waited, but you must have lost your way <eos> Now I've got heartaches by the number <eos> And the day that I'll stop counting <eos> That's the day my world will end <eos> 
There's a village, hidden deep in the valley <eos> Among the pine trees, half forlorn <eos> And there, on a sunny morning <eos> Little Jimmy Brown was born <eos> All the chapel bells were ringing <eos> In the little valley town <eos> And the song that they were singing <eos> Was for baby Jimmy Brown <eos> Then the little congregation <eos> Prayed for guidance from above <eos> "Lead us not into temptation <eos> Bless this hour of meditation <eos> Guide him with eternal love." <eos> There's a village, hidden deep in the valley <eos> Beneath the mountains high above <eos> And there, twenty years thereafter <eos> Jimmy was to meet his love <eos> All the chapel bells were ringing <eos> 'Twas a great day in his life <eos> Cause the song that they were singing <eos> Was for Jimmy and his wife <eos> Then the little congregation <eos> Prayed for guidance from above <eos> "Lead us not into temptation <eos> Bless, O Lord, this celebration <eos> May their lives be filled with love." <eos> From the village, hidden deep in the valley <eos> One rainy morning dark and gray <eos> A soul winged its way to Heaven <eos> Jimmy Brown had passed away <eos> Just one lonely bell was ringing <eos> In the little valley town <eos> 'Twas farewell that it was singing <eos> To our dear old Jimmy Brown <eos> And the little congregation <eos> Prayed for guidance from above <eos> "Lead us not into temptation <eos> May his soul find the salvation <eos> Of thy great eternal love." <eos> 
I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind <eos> To live in memories of old lonesome times <eos> I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say <eos> So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday <eos> Those happy hours that we once knew though long ago still make me blue <eos> They say that time heels the broken heart <eos> But time is stood still since we've been apart <eos> I can't stop loving you... <eos>

Whenever I chance to meet <eos> Some old friends on the street <eos> They wonder how does a man get to be this way <eos> I've always got a smiling face <eos> Anytime and any place <eos> And everytime they ask me why <eos> I just smile and say <eos> You've got to <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And let her know you think about her when you're gone <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And love her like the devil when you get back home <eos> Well people may try to guess <eos> The secret of a happiness <eos> But some of them never learn it's a simple thing <eos> The secret i'm speaking of <eos> Is a woman and a man in love <eos> And the answer is in this song <eos> That i always sing <eos> You've got to <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And let you know you think about her when you're gone <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And love her like the devil when you get back home <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And let you know you think about her when you're gone <eos> Kiss an angel good morning <eos> And love her like the devil when you get back home <eos> 
Cowboys ain't easy to love <eos> And they're harder to hold <eos> They'd rather give you a song <eos> Than diamonds or gold <eos> Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis <eos> And each night begins a new day <eos> If you don't understand him and he don't die young <eos> He'll probably just ride away <eos> Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys <eos> Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks <eos> Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such <eos> Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys <eos> 'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone <eos> Even with someone they love <eos> Cowboys like smoky old pool rooms <eos> And clear mountain mornings <eos> Little warm puppies and children <eos> And girls of the night <eos> Them that don't know him <eos> Won't like him and them that do <eos> Sometimes won't know how to take him <eos> He ain't wrong, he's just different <eos> But his pride won't let him <eos> Do things to make you think he's right <eos> Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys <eos> Don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks <eos> Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such <eos> Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys <eos> 'Cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone <eos> Even with someone they love <eos>

I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac <eos> Just about to lose my mind <eos> I was goin' to Arizona <eos> Maybe on to California <eos> Where the people all live so fine <eos> My baby said, I'z crazy <eos> My mama called me lazy <eos> I was gonna show 'em all this time <eos> 'Cause you know I ain't no fool <eos> And I don't need no more schoolin' <eos> I was born to just walk the line <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Well, you'll know I been through it <eos> When I set my watch back to it <eos> Livin' on Tulsa Time <eos> Well, there I was in Hollywood <eos> Wishin' I was doin' good <eos> Talkin' on the telephone line <eos> But they don't need me in the movies <eos> And nobody sings my songs <eos> Guess, I'm just a wastin' time <eos> Well, then I got to thinkin' <eos> Man I'm really sinkin' <eos> An I really had a flash this time <eos> I had no business leavin' <eos> An nobody would be grievin' <eos> If I just went on back to Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Gonna set my watch back to it <eos> 'Cause you know I been through it <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Gonna set my watch back to it <eos> 'Cause you know I been through <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> 
I've been walkin' these streets so long <eos> Singin' the same old song <eos> I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway <eos> Where hustle's the name of the game <eos> And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain <eos> There's been a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Well, I really don't mind the rain <eos> And a smile can hide all the pain <eos> But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way <eos> And I dream of the things I'll do <eos> With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe <eos> There'll be a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know <eos>

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere <eos> I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep <eos> So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness <eos> 'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak <eos> He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces <eos> And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes <eos> So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces <eos> For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice" <eos> So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow <eos> Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light <eos> And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression <eos> Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy <eos> You gotta learn to play it right" <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin' <eos> Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep <eos> 'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser <eos> And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep <eos> And when he finished speakin' <eos> He turned back towards the window <eos> Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep <eos> And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even <eos> But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em) <eos> Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em) <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos> You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em <eos> Know when to walk away and know when to run <eos> You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table <eos> There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done <eos>

In the twilight glow I see them <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> When we kissed goodbye and parted <eos> I knew we'd never meet again <eos> Love is like a dying ember <eos> And only memories remain <eos> And through the ages I'll remember <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> Some day when we meet up yonder <eos> We'll stroll hand-in-hand again <eos> In a land that knows no parting <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> Now my hair has turned to silver <eos> All my life I've loved in vain <eos> I can see her star in heaven <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> 
I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks <eos> Slow movin' trains and rain <eos> I love little country streams, sleep without dreams <eos> Sunday school in May and hay <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends <eos> Birds of the world and squirrels <eos> I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups <eos> Bourbon in a glass and grass <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child <eos> Tomatoes on the vine and onions <eos> I love winners when they cry, losers when they try <eos> Music when it's good and life <eos> And I love you too <eos>

If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> Now we could talk all night <eos> About the weather <eos> Could tell you about my friends <eos> Out on the coast <eos> I could ask a lot of crazy questions <eos> Or ask you what I really wanna know <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> Now rain can fall so soft <eos> Against the window <eos> Sun can shine so bright <eos> Up in the sky <eos> But Daddy always told me <eos> "Don't make small talk" <eos> He said, "Come on out and say <eos> What's on your mind" <eos> So if I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> 
She played tambourine with a silver jingle <eos> And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes <eos> But the one most requested by the man she knew as cowboy <eos> Was the late night benediction at the y'all come back saloon <eos> In a voice soft and trembling <eos> She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled round her raven hair <eos> And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders <eos> Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo <eos> He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love <eos> Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song <eos> He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos>

Hey <eos> Did you happen to see <eos> The most beautiful girl in the world? <eos> And if you did, was she crying, crying? <eos> Hey <eos> If you happen to see <eos> The most beautiful girl that walked out on me <eos> Tell her I'm sorry <eos> Tell her I need my baby <eos> Oh, won't you tell her that I love her <eos> I woke up this morning <eos> Realized what I had done <eos> I stood alone in the cold gray dawn <eos> I knew I'd lost my morning sun <eos> I lost my head and I said some things <eos> Now comes the heartaches that morning brings <eos> I know I'm wrong <eos> And I couldn't see <eos> I let my world slip away from me <eos> So, hey <eos> Did you happen to see <eos> The most beautiful girl in the world? <eos> And if you did, was she crying, crying? <eos> Hey <eos> If you happen to see <eos> The most beautiful girl that walked out on me <eos> Tell her I'm sorry <eos> Tell her I need my baby <eos> Oh, won't you tell her that I love her <eos> If you happen to see the most beautiful girl <eos> That walked out on me <eos> Tell her I'm sorry <eos> Tell her I need my baby <eos> Oh, won't you tell her that I love her <eos> 
Well, it was all, that I could do to keep from cryin' <eos> Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain <eos> But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' <eos> You never even call me by my name <eos> You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings <eos> And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride <eos> And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore <eos> Even though you're on my fightin' side <eos> And I'll hang around as long as you will let me <eos> And I never minded standin' in the rain <eos> But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' <eos> You never even called me by my name <eos> Well, I've heard my name a few times in your phone book (hello, hello) <eos> And I've seen it on signs where I've played <eos> But the only time I know I'll hear "David Allan Coe" <eos> Is when Jesus has his final judgment day <eos> And I'll hang around as long as you will let me <eos> And I never minded standin' in the rain <eos> But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' <eos> You never even called me by my name <eos> Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song <eos> And he told me it was the perfect country & western song <eos> I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the perfect country & western song <eos> Because he hadn't said anything at all about mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin' drunk <eos> Well he sat down and wrote another verse to the song and he sent it to me <eos> And after reading it I realized that my friend had written the perfect country & western song <eos> And I felt obliged to include it on this album <eos> The last verse goes like this here: <eos> Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison <eos> And I went to pick her up in the rain <eos> But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck <eos> She got run over by a damned old train <eos> And I'll hang around as long as you will let me <eos> And I never minded standin' in the rain <eos> No, an' you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' <eos> You never even call me <eos> Well, I wonder why you don't call me <eos> Why don't you ever call me by my name <eos> 
Coffee black, cigarettes <eos> Start this day, like all the rest <eos> First thing every morning that I do <eos> Is start missing you <eos> Some broken hearts never mend <eos> Some memories never end <eos> Some tears will never dry <eos> My love for you will never die <eos> Rendezvous in the night <eos> A willing woman to hold me tight <eos> But in the middle of love's embrace <eos> I see you're face <eos> Some broken hearts never mend <eos> Some memories never end <eos> Some tears will never dry <eos> My love for you will never die <eos> Some broken hearts never mend <eos> Some memories never end <eos> Some tears will never dry <eos> My love for you will never die <eos> 
Look at me <eos> I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree <eos> Ah, I'm walking on a cloud <eos> I can't understand, Lord <eos> I'm misty holding your hand <eos> Walk my way <eos> And a thousand violins begin to play <eos> Or it might be the sound of your hello <eos> That music I hear, Lord <eos> I'm misty the moment you're near <eos> You can say that you're leading me on <eos> But it's just what I want you to do <eos> Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost <eos> That's why I'm following you, ooh <eos> On my own <eos> Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now <eos> Never knowing my right foot from my left <eos> My hat from my glove, Lord <eos> I'm misty and too much in love <eos> You can say that you're leading me on <eos> But it's just what I want you to do <eos> Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost <eos> That's why I'm following you, ooh <eos> On my own <eos> Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now <eos> Never knowing my right foot from my left <eos> My hat from my glove, Lord <eos> I'm misty, and too much in love <eos> (Misty) Too much in love <eos> (Misty) Too much in love <eos> (Misty) <eos> (Misty) Too much in love <eos> 
Back through the years I go wandering once again <eos> Back to the seasons of my youth <eos> I recall a box of rags that someone gave us <eos> And how my mama put the rags to use <eos> There were rags of many colors, every piece was small <eos> And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall <eos> Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love <eos> She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of <eos> As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read <eos> About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said <eos> Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness <eos> And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss <eos> My coat of many colors that my mama made for me <eos> Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly <eos> Although we had no money I was rich as I could be <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes <eos> In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school <eos> Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich <eos> And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch <eos> And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed <eos> And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes <eos> But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see <eos> That one is only poor only if they choose to be <eos> Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> Made just for me <eos> 
Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings? <eos> Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain? <eos> Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway? <eos> Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me? <eos> Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape? <eos> Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way? <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> Caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> One heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers <eos> Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl <eos> I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me <eos> Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> Caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> I'm one heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape? <eos> Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way? <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> A caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> One heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> 
Mr. "Perfect face" <eos> Mr. "Here to stay" <eos> Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away" <eos> Everything was right <eos> Mr. "I've been waitin' for you all my life" <eos> Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side" <eos> But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart" <eos> Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart <eos> It takes everything in me just to get up each day <eos> But it's wonderful to see that you're okay <eos> Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> How's your heart after breakin' mine? <eos> Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby <eos> Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel" <eos> Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <eos> I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye <eos> And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> Mr. "Never told me why" <eos> Mr. "Never had to see me cry" <eos> Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy" <eos> He goes about his day <eos> Forgets he ever even heard my name <eos> Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same <eos> 'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl <eos> I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her <eos> And I never got past what you put me through <eos> But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you <eos> Hello, Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> How's your heart after breakin' mine? <eos> Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby <eos> Hello, Mr. "Casually cruel" <eos> Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <eos> I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye <eos> And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> So dignified in your well-pressed suit <eos> So strategized, all the eyes on you <eos> Sashay your way to your seat <eos> It's the best seat, in the best room <eos> Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins" <eos> So far above me in every sense <eos> So far above feeling anything <eos> And it's really such a shame <eos> It's such a shame <eos> 'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay" <eos> Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday" <eos> And someday maybe you'll miss me <eos> But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late" <eos> Goodbye, Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> How's your heart after breakin' mine? <eos> Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby <eos> Goodbye, Mr. "Casually cruel" <eos> Mr. "Everything revolves around you" <eos> I've been Miss Misery for the last time <eos> And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine" <eos> You're perfectly fine <eos> Mr. "Look me in the eye and told me you would never go away" <eos> You said you'd never go away <eos> 
Mmm, mmm, mmm <eos> Flowers in hand, waiting for me <eos> Every word in poetry <eos> Won't call me by name, only "baby" <eos> The more that you give, the less that I need <eos> Everyone says I look happy <eos> When it feels right <eos> I know that you're wrong for me <eos> Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave <eos> I brought you down to your knees <eos> 'Cause they say that misery loves company <eos> It's not your fault I ruin everything <eos> And it's not your fault I can't be what you need <eos> Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me <eos> I'm everything they said I would be <eos> La, la, la <eos> I'm everything they said I would be <eos> I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye <eos> Before you let go, just one more time <eos> Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine <eos> A little more hurt won't kill you <eos> Tonight, mother says you don't look happy <eos> Close your eyes <eos> I know that you're wrong for me <eos> Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave <eos> I brought you down to your knees <eos> 'Cause they say that misery loves company <eos> It's not your fault I ruin everything <eos> And it's not your fault I can't be what you need <eos> Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me <eos> I'm everything they said I would be <eos> La, la, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> Oh, ah, ah <eos> Ah, oh <eos> Ah, oh <eos> I know that you're wrong for me <eos> Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave <eos> I brought you down to your knees <eos> 'Cause they say that misery loves company <eos> It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything) <eos> And it's not your fault I can't be what you need <eos> Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh <eos> Angels like you can't fly down here with me <eos> 
Yeah, yeah <eos> I don't remember much about last night <eos> Woke up on a couch sun-rise <eos> Saw the living room <eos> Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober <eos> You didn’t like that I came home late <eos> 4 AM but it's a Friday, babe <eos> And I've been working hard <eos> Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, "Oh my God"? <eos> Oh-oh, ooh-yeah <eos> Oh-oh, ooh-yeah <eos> I go out with some new friends <eos> But it just makes me miss you more, more <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many <eos> Come take me home <eos> So now I'm the one that's crying <eos> I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight <eos> I swear that I was trying, yeah <eos> But everybody falls when their head's a little high <eos> And I've never meant to get so out my mind <eos> With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine <eos> Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this <eos> Too many times before <eos> Oh-oh, ooh yeah <eos> Oh-oh, ooh yeah <eos> I go out with some new friends <eos> But it just makes me miss you more, more <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many <eos> Come take me home <eos> I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no <eos> I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you <eos> I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no <eos> I know we're both stubborn <eos> Push each other's buttons <eos> I'd rather do it with you, but... <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many, come take me home <eos> Come take me home <eos> Yeah, I've had one too many <eos> 
On the day I die <eos> You better dance, don't cry <eos> Baby, I'll be leaving on a high <eos> On the day I die <eos> Find the keys to my old car <eos> Pray it starts and take it for a drive <eos> Roll the windows down <eos> Turn the music up <eos> Start singing (Woah, woah) <eos> And get lost in a song <eos> And take the wrong road home <eos> Like I always used to <eos> If I did one thing right <eos> It was you and I <eos> Oh, I loved you <eos> I'll always love you <eos> So play it loud all night <eos> If I'm not by your side <eos> I'm up above you <eos> I'll always love you <eos> I've had a good, good life <eos> So, darling, dance, don't cry <eos> On the day I die <eos> On the day I die <eos> I want nothing left unspoken <eos> I can't rely on hoping that you know <eos> So dry your eyes <eos> 'Cause I don't plan on dying yet <eos> Just take my hand <eos> How I lucky I am <eos> The only life I get <eos> I get to hold you close <eos> With the lights down low <eos> And dance real slow (Woah, woah) <eos> When you hear this song <eos> And when I'm gone <eos> I know that you'll know <eos> If I did one thing right <eos> It was you and I <eos> Oh, I loved you <eos> I'll always love you <eos> So play it loud all night <eos> If I'm not by your side <eos> I'm up above you <eos> I'll always love you <eos> I've had a good, good life <eos> So, darling, dance, don't cry <eos> On the day I die <eos> On the day I die (Woah, woah) <eos> (Woah, woah) <eos> On the day, on the day I die, oh (Woah, woah) <eos> (Woah, woah) <eos> On the day I die <eos> You better dance, don't cry <eos> Oh baby, I'll be leaving on a high <eos> On the day I die <eos> 
Meet me in the morning, meet me at the dawn <eos> With a heart full of love, a head full of dreams <eos> And a blanket I can throw on <eos> Better than the movies, tune my stereo <eos> With a car full of us, a bed in the back seat <eos> And nowhere to go <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold <eos> I was born for lovin', you were born for me <eos> Days in the sun, just a boy on the run <eos> And a girl who looks something like me <eos> Pennies in our pockets, shadows in our eyes <eos> It's red in the west, and you look your best <eos> Under that heavenly sky <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold (Hey) <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold (Hey) <eos> I'll be earth, you be fire <eos> We got love to take us higher <eos> Water flows, thunder rolls <eos> I'll be your band of gold (Hey) <eos> I'll be your band of gold <eos> I'll be your band of gold <eos> 
A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos> 
If you don't like it, then get the hell out <eos> That's what they yell when I open my mouth <eos> A stick is a stick, a stone is a stone <eos> But who's gonna care if I don't? <eos> Who's gonna change if I won't? <eos> When time turns this moment to dust <eos> I just hope that I'm proud of the woman I was <eos> When lines of tomorrow are drawn <eos> Can I live with the side that I chose to be on? <eos> Will we sit on our hands, do nothin' about it? <eos> Or will we leave this world better than we found it? <eos> Over and under and above the law <eos> My neighbor's in danger, who does he call? <eos> When thе wolf's at the door all covered in bluе <eos> Shouldn't we try somethin' new? <eos> We're over a barrel, and at the end of one too <eos> When time turns this moment to dust <eos> I just hope that I'm proud of the woman I was <eos> When lines of tomorrow are drawn <eos> Can I live with the side that I chose to be on? <eos> Will we sit on our hands, do nothin' about it? <eos> Or will we leave this world better than we found it? <eos> America, America <eos> Divided we fall <eos> America, America <eos> God save us all <eos> From ourselves and the hell that we've built for our kids <eos> America, America <eos> We're better than this <eos> When time turns this moment to dust <eos> I just hope my son's proud of the woman I was <eos> When lines of tomorrow are drawn <eos> Can I live with the side that I chose to be on? <eos> Will we sit on our hands, do nothin' about it? <eos> Can we leave this world better than we found it? <eos> America, America <eos> 
The way you look when you cry make me wanna confess to you <eos> The way you wear that dress, like it couldn't mean less to you <eos> And there's no reason, keeping secrets <eos> Maybe regret is a weakness <eos> But all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> Don't wanna come home late and make a mistake for you <eos> It's easier to let a heart wait than make a heart break for you <eos> I gave you pieces of my secrets like religion to believe in <eos> And all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else, somebody else <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh (Make a heart break for you) <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah, yeah <eos> 
Danny had the loudest laugh <eos> He knows it, he knows it <eos> Danny had the fullest heart <eos> He shows it, he shows it <eos> Danny had the loudest laugh <eos> And Danny had the fullest heart <eos> He did, he did, he did <eos> Danny had to work all day <eos> He loved it, he loved it <eos> And Danny had to smoke all day <eos> 'Cause he left me, he left me <eos> Danny had to go away <eos> Said he was gonna get paid <eos> He did, he did, he did <eos> And he said, "It's alright, it's alright <eos> I'll be right by your side <eos> It's alright, it's alright <eos> 'Cause I'm still by your side <eos> It's alright, it's alright <eos> 'Cause I'm right by your side" <eos> But Danny liked to lie <eos> 'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye" <eos> Got on a big old train <eos> To London, London <eos> Said he had to catch a plane <eos> And left me wondering <eos> If he'd ever come home again <eos> Said he'd come home again <eos> He did, he did, he did <eos> Gone for a year or so <eos> Chasing money <eos> He called me on the phone <eos> "Hello, honey" <eos> Said he still loved me so <eos> More than I'd ever know <eos> He did, he did, he did <eos> And he said, "It's alright, it's alright <eos> I'll be right by your side <eos> It's alright, it's alright <eos> 'Cause I'm still by your side <eos> It's alright, it's alright <eos> 'Cause I'm right by your side" <eos> But Danny liked to lie <eos> 'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye" <eos> Got a letter in the mail <eos> Danny's ship had just set sail <eos> Caught out by a hundred guns <eos> Danny had nowhere to run <eos> Well, I guess it was his time <eos> And I'm doing fine <eos> Now Danny's just a dream at night <eos> Oh he sings a lullaby <eos> "It's alright, it's alright <eos> I'll be right by your side <eos> "It's alright, it's alright <eos> 'Cause I'm still by your side <eos> It's alright, it's alright <eos> I'll be right by your side" <eos> But Danny was a liar <eos> 'Cause he said, "I'd never say goodbye" <eos> 
I still sit around thinking <eos> Wondering what you've been up to <eos> And if you're happy now <eos> Sure looks like she loves you <eos> And the 'what could've been's' <eos> Are always what I come back to <eos> Like it's always been you <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> I realise, it doesn't do me any good <eos> To dream about the good times <eos> And a part of me knows it was the right thing to say goodbye <eos> But I lie awake at night <eos> I toss and turn and wonder why <eos> In hindsight <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 
When I was your man and you were my girl <eos> We were technicolor in a black and white world <eos> Yeah, they say young love just don't last <eos> Well, it looks like they were right about that <eos> And oh, I hope one day you'll find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I'll put this heart of mine <eos> Somewhere good and safe <eos> In case you want it again someday <eos> Well, you moved on, and so did I <eos> But you danced around in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) <eos> Yeah, good for you, he seems like a good guy <eos> Well, you know me enough to know that's a lie <eos> And oh, I hope one day you'll find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I'll put this heart of mine <eos> Somewhеre good and safe <eos> In case you want it again somеday <eos> Oh, ah <eos> Oh, ooh <eos> You called me up, said you had a big fight <eos> I said don't cry, it's gonna be alright <eos> You say, come over, you just need a friend <eos> Well, I'm on my way, I'll be there in ten <eos> And oh, I knew someday you'd find <eos> Your way back into my arms <eos> So girl, I kept this heart of mine <eos> Somewhere good and safe <eos> I knew you'd want it again someday <eos> I always hoped and prayed <eos> That you'd want it again someday <eos>

Choking back a Breezer on the patio <eos> Within earshot of that guy we knew <eos> Oh the Marian Keyes of it all <eos> Babe you rewriting everything I do <eos> Out the back it's freezing, yeah it's very cold <eos> So I switch it up and head inside <eos> Lock eyes with another adult woman <eos> I can tell is trying not to cry <eos> But I can't ignore it <eos> I can't let it go <eos> I hate that your friends hate me now <eos> I hate me on my own, own, own <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Bully, bully you said I'm a bully oh <eos> But I thought I was just helping? <eos> Yeah, I see what you mean now <eos> I'm mеan and I'm brutal and selfish <eos> I just spent sevеn hours looking at old pics of me <eos> Tryna pinpoint where the bitch began <eos> Somewhere after the Passion of Christ <eos> And before I had an Instagram <eos> Still can't ignore it <eos> I can't cut the cord <eos> Nah not like you have <eos> Now that you got bored <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> All you did was hurt yourself <eos> And let me take the blame <eos> I loved you like a mirror <eos> So I guess I've done the same <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos>
