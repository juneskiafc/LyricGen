Me extraña, aunque me diga que no se que me ama <eos> Y se que me piensa solita en la cama <eos> Cuando ella se toca mi nombre exclama <eos> Conmigo, varios fueron las noches que no dormimos <eos> Su novio pensando que yo soy su amigo <eos> Si supiera todo lo que nos hicimos <eos> Y que será de todo lo que ha pasado me pregunto si sabrá <eos> Talvez ya se a dado cuenta que yo no quiero nada <eos> Solamente me divierte si es que desnuda esta <eos> Se pintó los labios rojos sabe bien que va pasar <eos> Tendrá cara de angelita pero se porta muy mal <eos> Se pusó una mini falda y zapatillas pa bailar <eos> Sabe muy bien lo que quiere y derecho al grano va <eos> Tequila para olvidar <eos> Un blonte no vendria mal <eos> Para ella, regular <eos> El efecto viene y va <eos> Solo la hace sentir mal <eos> Cada que sierra los ojos <eos> En mi se pone a pensar <eos> Y en las noches que pasamos ella y yo <eos> En esa cama de aquel cuarto de esa sucia habitación <eos> So what's up baby <eos> Y pura La Empresa Music <eos> Me divierte cada que le llamo ella esta pendiente <eos> Deja a su novio pa' salir a verme <eos> Me manda mensajes de que esta caliente <eos> Bellaca, ella es una diabla, el alcohol la prende <eos> Le gusta hablar sucio sabe que me enciende <eos> Llego en caliente sin pensar me atiende <eos> Y que será creo que ya le esta gustando lo que yo le puedo dar <eos> Dice que su hombre no sabe lo que ella necesita <eos> Que solamente se viene si es que conmigo esta <eos> Se pintó los labios rojos sabe bien que va pasar <eos> Tendrá cara de angelita pero se porta muy mal <eos> Se pusó una mini falda y zapatillas pa bailar <eos> Sabe muy bien lo que quiere y derecho al grano va <eos> Tequila para olvidar <eos> Un blonte no vendria mal <eos> Para ella es regular <eos> El efecto viene y va <eos> Solo la hace sentir mal <eos> Cada que sierra los ojos <eos> En mi se pone a pensar <eos> Y en las noches que pasamos ella y yo <eos> En la cama de aquel cuarto de esa sucia habitación <eos>

I found a love for me <eos> Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <eos> Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <eos> Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me <eos> 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <eos> Not knowing what it was <eos> I will not give you up this time <eos> But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own <eos> And in your eyes, you're holding mine <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song <eos> When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath <eos> But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight <eos> Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know <eos> She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home <eos> I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets <eos> To carry love, to carry children of our own <eos> We are still kids, but we're so in love <eos> Fighting against all odds <eos> I know we'll be alright this time <eos> Darling, just hold my hand <eos> Be my girl, I'll be your man <eos> I see my future in your eyes <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song <eos> When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful <eos> I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight <eos> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms <eos> Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song <eos> I have faith in what I see <eos> Now I know I have met an angel in person <eos> And she looks perfect <eos> I don't deserve this <eos> You look perfect tonight <eos> 
VERSE 1 <eos> You wouldn't read my letter if I wrote you <eos> You asked me not to call you on the phone <eos> But there's something I'm wanting to tell you <eos> So I wrote it in the words of this song <eos> CHORUS <eos> I didn't know God made honky tonk angels <eos> I might have known you'd never make a wife <eos> You gave up the only one that ever loved you <eos> And went back to the wild side of life <eos> VERSE 2 <eos> The glamor of the gay night life has lured you <eos> To the places where the wine and liquor flows <eos> Where you wait to be anybody's baby <eos> And forget the truest love you'll ever know <eos> CHORUS <eos> 
Take me to the ocean <eos> Take me to the sea <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be free <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be... <eos> What now, it’s coming around <eos> You’re feeling cut down into the ground <eos> So we all come together, we’re making a sound <eos> We sing “Look at all this love we’ve found” <eos> Gotta raise em up, toast to the sweet life <eos> If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right <eos> See the sun giving me the green light <eos> To kick back, relax and soak up the sweet sights <eos> There’s something in the air <eos> Come and take away my cares <eos> I close my eyes <eos> Remember these dreams that we share <eos> I wash it all away <eos> You gotta give us all a break <eos> Let the troubles of tomorrow <eos> Wait till another day <eos> When life’s moving to fast <eos> We can make this dream last <eos> Just let the past be the past <eos> Just leave it all behind <eos> 
Hallé una flor un día en el camino <eos> Que apareció marchita y deshojada <eos> Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro <eos> Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla <eos> Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos <eos> A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma <eos> Recuperó el color que había perdido <eos> Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que nadie le robe el color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas <eos> Nació el amor que un día se había perdido <eos> Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra <eos> Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que siempre este cerca de mí <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Le fui brindando cariño, un poquito de amor <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Y en el invierno llenó mi jardín de color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Ay, cuando la vi, me enamoré y me la llevé, me la llevé <eos> ¡Avemaría! <eos> ¡Puerto Rico! <eos> Jajaja <eos> ¡Ataca, Sergio <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> ¡Esto sigue! <eos> 
I should've stayed at home <eos> 'Cause right now I see all these people that love me <eos> But I still feel alone <eos> Can't help but check my phone <eos> I could've made you mine <eos> But no, it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you <eos> And you weren't made for me <eos> Though it seemed so easy <eos> And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one that makes your day <eos> The one you think about as you lie awake <eos> I can't wait to be your number one <eos> I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine <eos> But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry <eos> But won't you wait? <eos> You know it's too late <eos> I'm on my own shit now <eos> Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great <eos> I feel great <eos> Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> You need to be yourself <eos> Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool <eos> That makes your heart melt <eos> Who knows what you truly felt <eos> You're still my favorite girl <eos> You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else <eos> More beautiful in this damn world <eos> In this damn world <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> I said that <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> Best friend <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby <eos> You're gonna wanna be my best friend <eos> I say that I'm happy <eos> I say that I'm happy <eos> But no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, oh <eos> I still wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one that makes your day <eos> The one you think about as you lie awake <eos> And I can't wait to be your number, your number one <eos> I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine <eos> But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry <eos> I still wanna be your favorite boy <eos> I wanna be the one <eos> I might just be the one <eos> 
Must have been a mistake <eos> While you make things hard for me <eos> I wouldn't hurt you at all if I didn't have to <eos> Give in it's our first fight <eos> But now that I see this side <eos> I want to more than I did before <eos> This night has opened my eyes <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> Communication's down <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> We come closer <eos> Temptations, they crumble by your side <eos> You say you wouldn't hurt me at all <eos> Can't be sure that you mean it <eos> If it's worth holding on to, we can't stay in between it <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> Communication's down <eos> I know you, hope I do now <eos> We come closer <eos> A comfort to us all <eos> Insured against a fall from normal life <eos> Afraid to be at it alone <eos> To shoulder I wonder is it safe for now <eos> This could go either way <eos> It could work out between us, or never again <eos> Make it clean, how realistic we mean to <eos> I know you <eos> 
Recuerdo que al llegar ni me miraste <eos> Fui solo una más de cientos <eos> Y, sin embargo, fueron tuyos <eos> Los primeros voleteos <eos> Cómo no pude darme cuenta <eos> Que hay ascensores prohibidos <eos> Que hay pecados compartidos <eos> Y que tú estabas tan cerca <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Mis anclajes no pararon tus instintos <eos> Ni los tuyos, mis quejidos <eos> Y dejo correr mis tuercas <eos> Y que hormigas me retuerzan <eos> Quiero que no dejes de estrujarme <eos> Sin que yo te diga nada <eos> Que tus yemas sean lagañas <eos> Enganchadas a mis vértices <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> No sé que acabó sucediendo <eos> Sólo sentí dentro dardos <eos> Nuestra incómoda postura <eos> Se dilató en el espacio <eos> Se me hunde el dolor en el costado <eos> Se me nublan los recodos <eos> Tengo sed y estoy tragando <eos> No quiero no estar a tu lado <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> Y las palabras se me apartan <eos> Me vacían las entrañas <eos> Finjo que no sé, y que no has sabido <eos> Finjo que no me gusta estar contigo <eos> Y al perderme entre mis dedos <eos> Te recuerdo sin esfuerzo <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> 
Wake me up this morning <eos> And take me down to the corner <eos> Place before the shade <eos> Where we eat and that's where we talk <eos> Retreats behind the wall and <eos> And that's when i decide to stay here <eos> Wake me up this morning <eos> And take me down to the corner <eos> Place before the shade <eos> Where we eat and that's where we talk <eos> Retreats behind the wall and <eos> And that's when i decide to stay here <eos> Cup of tea, blackberry <eos> Golden Gate Bridge <eos> Everything's alright now <eos> Don't let me sleep <eos> It was warm and pleasant (It was so) <eos> And over in an instant (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> I feel like i dreamt it (But I'm not there now) <eos> But I'm not there now <eos> Easier to drive <eos> Leave the oven on <eos> Burn the house down <eos> Cup of tea, blackberry <eos> Golden Gate Bridge <eos> Everything's alright now <eos> Don't let me sleep <eos> Cup of tea, blackberry <eos> Golden Gate Bridge <eos> Everything's alright now <eos> Don't let me sleep <eos> It was warm and pleasant (It was so) <eos> And over in an instant (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> I feel like i dreamt it (But I'm not there now) <eos> But I'm not there now <eos> When he left me, we drove into our  <eos> 
Dichos oigo y me recuerdan <eos> Me recuerdan noche y dia <eos> De esos tan bonitos días <eos> Que me declaraste viva <eos> Y hoy ando pero ando muy sola <eos> Sola como va la brisa <eos> Mozo tu no me decías <eos> Que se iba a cansar tu risa <eos> Risa que fue calentando <eos> De poquito a poco la mirada mía <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Porque me dejas <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> No dices como, ni cuando <eos> Solo me dejas <eos> Cuando andando por tu barrio <eos> Yo me encuentro a tus amigos <eos> Me dicen que te ven muy triste <eos> Triste por haberte ido <eos> Y eso es lo que yo no entiendo <eos> Amor tu sabes bien <eos> Cuanto es que yo te quiero <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> Tán así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Porqué me dejas <eos> Mozo porqué me dejas <eos> No dices como, ni cuando <eos> Sólo me dejas <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada de tí <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Mozo tú me dejaste <eos> Tan así de pronto <eos> Y sin decir nada <eos> Tú me dejaste <eos> Mozo ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Verdad que sí <eos> Ya me olvidaste <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada de tí <eos> Ya no quiero saber nada <eos>

Losing time <eos> Thinking about you and nothing more <eos> I hang around <eos> There's nothing else I'm looking for <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> All those wishes <eos> That I made on stars for you <eos> They all fall down <eos> Fade away and it's so far from true <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> I'd give you more than you can take <eos> Promises you know I'd make <eos> Can my heart do more than ache? <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> Alone is asleep <eos> In love is awake <eos> 
Sé que nunca vas a hacerme daño <eos> Pero mi intuición me hace dudarlo otra vez, yeah <eos> Dime que en ti yo puedo confiar <eos> Sé que estás pa' mí, yo también 'stoy pa' ti <eos> Pero si sales de noche con tus amiguitos <eos> Y hay una baby que quiera contigo <eos> ¿Dirías que no o perderías control? <eos> No hay nada que hacer <eos> Eres un niño, lo sé <eos> No sabes si estás bien o mal <eos> Esa es la realidad <eos> Tengo que entender <eos> Que eres un niño porque <eos> Es imposible apagar tu instinto animal <eos> Un niño eres <eos> Me imagino lo que deberías pensar <eos> Que estoy bien loca, siempre tan celosa <eos> Pero eso no es verdad, no soy así <eos> Y me empiezo a preguntar, preguntar <eos> Si estás con alguien más <eos> O es mi inseguridad <eos> Si sales de noche con tus amiguitos <eos> Y hay una baby que quiera lo mismo <eos> ¿Dirías que no o tendrá tu atención? <eos> No hay nada que hacer <eos> Eres un niño, lo sé <eos> No sabes si estás bien o mal <eos> Esa es la realidad <eos> Tengo que entender <eos> Que eres un niño porque <eos> Es imposible apagar tu instinto animal <eos> Un niño eres <eos> Un niño eres <eos> Eh, mmm-mmm <eos> Un niño eres <eos> Un niño eres <eos> Eh-eh, mmm-mmm-mmm <eos> 
Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> You came into my heart <eos> So tenderly <eos> With a burning love <eos> That stings like a bee <eos> Now that I surrender <eos> So helplessly <eos> You now wanna leave <eos> Ooh, you wanna leave me <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> Ooh, don't you want me? <eos> Don't you want me no more? <eos> Ooh, baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go <eos> And all your promises <eos> Of a love forever more <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> Before you won my heart <eos> You were a perfect guy <eos> But now that you got me <eos> You wanna leave me behind <eos> (Baby, baby) ooh baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> 
And I hate <eos> Everything you’re saying <eos> Anxiety <eos> It’s all about me <eos> Watch out for those who dare to say <eos> That everything will be okay <eos> Watch out for those who want to be <eos> Anything at all <eos> And I hate <eos> Everything you’re saying <eos> Anxiety <eos> It’s all about me <eos> Watch out for those who dare to say <eos> That everything will be okay <eos> Watch out for those who want to be <eos> Anything at all <eos> They’re coming for me <eos> 
The scent that you left on my pillow <eos> The sound of your heartbeat with mine <eos> The look in your eyes like a window <eos> The taste of your kiss soaked in wine <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> Guess you forgot what you told me <eos> Because you left my heart on the floor <eos> Baby, your ghost still haunts me <eos> But I don't want to sleep with him no more <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> They say time is the only healer <eos> God, I hope that isn't right <eos> Cause right now I'd die to not remember <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> I'm haunted by the memories of <eos> Every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Every little thing <eos>

(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To explain in due time all I know <eos> Time is a valuable thing <eos> Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <eos> Watch it count down to the end of the day <eos> The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal) <eos> Didn't look out below <eos> Watch the time go right out the window <eos> Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know <eos> I wasted it all just to watch you go <eos> I kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To remind myself how I tried so hard <eos> In spite of the way you were mockin' me <eos> Actin' like I was part of your property <eos> Rememberin' all the times you fought with me <eos> I'm surprised it got so far <eos> Things aren't the way they were before <eos> You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <eos> Not that you knew me back then <eos> But it all comes back to me in the end <eos> You kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> 
Alright, Rock 'n' Roll, yeah <eos> At the end of a dream <eos> If you know where I mean <eos> When the mist just starts to clear <eos> In a similar way <eos> At the end of today <eos> I could feel the sound of writing on the wall <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the least that you can do <eos> Like a spiral on the wine <eos> I can hear it screamin' in my mind <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Let it live <eos> In a different time <eos> When the words didn't rhyme <eos> You could never quite be sure <eos> Then on with the change <eos> It was simple but strange <eos> And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the least that you can do <eos> Like a spiral on the wine <eos> I can hear it screamin' in my mind <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> I'm losing control <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Look here, If you suddenly see <eos> What has happened to me <eos> You should spread the word around <eos> And tell everyone here <eos> That it's perfectly clear <eos> They can sail above it all on what they've found <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the best that you can do <eos> Like a sound that's everywhere <eos> I can hear it screaming through the air <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Let it live <eos> Let it live <eos> Let it live <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> That is how I weight the perfect playing this <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos>

Once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it <eos> I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage <eos> I wanna drive this car right over the edge <eos> Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet <eos> I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic <eos> Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic <eos> I never meant to be hypocritical <eos> This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it <eos> I tell myself every night, I could live without it <eos> I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness <eos> But every time I do, I make another mess <eos> And just like that, I know there's no looking back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad) <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> 
I move along <eos> Something's wrong <eos> I guess a part of me is gone <eos> Skies are gray <eos> Start to fade <eos> I guess I threw it all away <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Tired soul <eos> Dying hope <eos> I guess I'm running out of road <eos> I guess I've got nowhere <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Feels like I'm dying <eos> Feels like I'm lying to myself <eos> I know that I'm trying <eos> But it feels like I'm in Hell <eos> I'm in Hell <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> 
Dreams on your face, taking you away <eos> Silence on a silver plate <eos> Got no explanations beyond imagination <eos> How beautiful you are to me <eos> Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling <eos> I look at your face all night <eos> I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it <eos> And dream about me tonight <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I'd never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos> I can assure you, when it comes to this game <eos> That you'll never know how I play <eos> No intimidation, it's pure adoration <eos> I love you more than yesterday <eos> Like an insomniac stares at the ceiling <eos> I look at your face all night <eos> I'm touching your body, I hope that you feel it <eos> And dream about me tonight <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I'd never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> Woo <eos> When you sleep <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> When you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep, when you sleep <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When your eyes are closed <eos> I whisper in your ear <eos> Things I never dare to speak <eos> I miss you when you sleep <eos> When you are exposed <eos> I always steal a kiss <eos> 'Cause I miss you when you sleep <eos> Woo <eos> When you sleep <eos> When you sleep <eos>

Vierte noche y ráfagas de cierzo <eos> Vierte hambre negra de cuchillo <eos> En mi ardiente sangre <eos> En mi pena grande <eos> Vierte azogue y plomo en mis heridas <eos> Tú, en la noche cierta que me aloca <eos> Como un lobo-hombre <eos> Que es de celuloide <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Si entre la gente ya no me reconoces <eos> ¿Cómo subir descalzo a la montaña santa? <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Tu mano helada me devolverá la vida <eos> El contacto de tu piel <eos> La vida intacta <eos> Y ahora sigue robándome el calor <eos> Como aquel amanecer de grises garzas <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Vierte cera, clava espuela y rasga el alba <eos> Tiende capas luengas a mi paso <eos> Que cubran los errores y los juramentos <eos> Calla, que son brillo tus palabras <eos> Calla, de moneda falsa <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Camino solo y la fuerza ya no me alcanza <eos> Hoy ya sé que lo aposté todo a una partida vana <eos> ¿Qué puedo hacer, a dónde ir? <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Salgamos al frío de la noche <eos> Junto al río, hogueras <eos> Ebrias sombras danzantes y oxidadas <eos> Escapo aullando al paso siseante de los retrovisores <eos>

I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back <eos> We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check <eos> We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached <eos> But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then <eos> Kristen, come right back <eos> I've been waiting for you <eos> To slip back in bed <eos> When you light the candle <eos> And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now <eos> And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall <eos> Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe <eos> Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else <eos> Kristen, come right back <eos> I've been waiting for you <eos> To slip back in bed <eos> When you light the candle <eos> And I'm kissing you lying in my room <eos> Holding you until you fall asleep <eos> And it's just as good as I knew it would be <eos> Stay with me, I don't want you to leave <eos> Kristen, come right back <eos> I've been waiting for you <eos> To slip back in bed <eos> When you light the candle <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos>

The day after you said, "Goodbye" <eos> All I did was lay in bed and cry <eos> But after one month, I started to move on <eos> And after two, I felt alright <eos> Then three months in, you were off my mind <eos> And month four and five, I was living my life <eos> I was better and didn't have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> The day after you had reached out <eos> I was broken for the second time around <eos> I prayed on the third day that I would be okay <eos> That I'd forget you were ever mine <eos> Oh, I don't think you realize <eos> How long I had to fight to be living my life <eos> To get better and never have to try <eos> Not to think of you, until you reached out and said <eos> "Remember that night?" <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Do you remember? <eos> Remember? <eos> We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning <eos> I kissed you, it was pouring <eos> We held each other tight <eos> Before the night was over <eos> You looked over your shoulder <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Oh, I was doing fine <eos> You said, "Remember that night? <eos> Remember that night?" <eos> Do you remember? <eos> Remember? <eos> 
I met you in the dark <eos> You lit me up <eos> You made me feel as though <eos> I was enough <eos> We danced the night away <eos> We drank too much <eos> I held your hair back when <eos> You were throwing up <eos> Then you smiled over your shoulder <eos> For a minute, I was stone cold sober <eos> I pulled you closer to my chest <eos> And you asked me to stay over <eos> I said, I already told ya <eos> I think that you should get some rest <eos> I knew I loved you then <eos> But you'd never know <eos> 'Cause I played it cool <eos> When I was scared of letting go <eos> I knew I needed you <eos> But I never showed <eos> But I wanna stay with you <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed <eos> I'll bring you coffee <eos> With a kiss on your head <eos> And I'll take the kids to school <eos> Wave them goodbye <eos> And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night <eos> When you looked over your shoulder <eos> For a minute, I forget that I'm older <eos> I wanna dance with you right now, oh <eos> And you look as beautiful as ever <eos> And I swear that every day you'll get better <eos> You make me feel this way somehow <eos> I'm so in love with you <eos> And I hope you know <eos> Darling your love is more <eos> Than worth its weight in gold <eos> We've come so far my dear <eos> Look how we've grown <eos> And I wanna stay with you <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> I wanna live with you <eos> Even when we're ghosts <eos> 'Cause you were always there for me <eos> When I needed you most <eos> I'm gonna love you till <eos> My lungs give out <eos> I promise 'til death we part <eos> Like in our vows <eos> So I wrote this song for you <eos> Now everybody knows <eos> That it's just you and me <eos> Until we're grey and old <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Just say you won't let go <eos> Oh, just say you won't let go <eos> 
You know the line <eos> Slivers of heaven <eos> Hanging in the breeze like a guillotine <eos> Starved for attention <eos> Nothing would materialize <eos> No spell, no solstice <eos> Either behind bars or you’re tending to the blast furnace <eos> I would never relieve the pressure even if I could <eos> Keeps the senses razor sharp <eos> And does the body good <eos> “You'll be living off candlelight” <eos> Said the main circuit <eos> And the labored pangs of the acid rain <eos> Kept me stirring <eos> I would never relieve the pressure even if I tried <eos> Lost dogs, leap years, all idling by <eos> I was staring through a dull lens <eos> Looking for the edge of the frame <eos> I can't see it following a disillusion <eos> Right up to the end of the page <eos> Takes the drive right out of me <eos> Always tying up a loose end <eos> Waiting for the trumpets to call <eos> I can't hear ‘em <eos> I was dreaming about cold fusion <eos> Listening to the conditioned air <eos> Picking up what's barely there <eos> 
The snow's comin' down <eos> (Christmas) I'm watching it fall <eos> (Christmas) Lots of people around <eos> Baby, please come home <eos> The church bells in town <eos> (Christmas) All ringing in song <eos> (Christmas) Full of happy sounds <eos> (Christmas) Baby, please come home <eos> They're singing Deck The Halls <eos> But it's not like Christmas at all <eos> 'Cause I remember when you were here <eos> And all the fun we had last year <eos> Pretty lights on the tree <eos> (Christmas) I'm watching them shine <eos> (Christmas) You should be here with me <eos> (Christmas) Baby, please come home <eos> They're singing Deck The Halls <eos> But it's not like Christmas at all <eos> 'Cause I remember when you were here <eos> And all the fun we had last year <eos> (Christmas) If there was a way <eos> (Christmas) I'd hold back this tear <eos> (Christmas) But it's Christmas day <eos> (Christmas) Baby, please come home <eos> (Christmas) Oh, please come home <eos> (Christmas) Oh, I need you to come home <eos> (Christmas) Come home, come home, come home <eos> 
Well, she was an American girl <eos> Raised on promises <eos> She couldn't help thinkin' that there <eos> Was a little more to life somewhere else <eos> After all, it was a great big world <eos> With lots of places to run to <eos> And if she had to die tryin', she <eos> Had one little promise she was gonna keep <eos> Oh yeah, all right <eos> Take it easy, baby <eos> Make it last all night (Make it last all night) <eos> She was an American girl <eos> Well, it was kinda cold that night <eos> She stood alone on her balcony (Ooh) <eos> Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by <eos> Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach <eos> And for one desperate moment there <eos> He crept back in her memory <eos> God, it's so painful when something that is so close <eos> Is still so far out of reach <eos> Oh yeah, all right <eos> Take it easy, baby <eos> Make it last all night (Make it last all night) <eos> She was an American girl (Ooh) <eos> 
'Twas in another lifetime <eos> One of toil and blood <eos> When blackness was a virtue <eos> The road was full of mud <eos> I came in from the wilderness <eos> A creature void of form <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> And if I pass this way again <eos> You can rest assured <eos> I'll always do my best for her <eos> On that I give my word <eos> In a world of steel-eyed death and men <eos> Who are fighting to be warm <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Not a word was spoke between us <eos> There was little risk involved <eos> Everything up to that point <eos> Had been left unresolved <eos> Try imagining a place <eos> Where it's always safe and warm <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> I was burned out from exhaustion <eos> Buried in the hail <eos> Poisoned in the bushes <eos> And blown out on the trail <eos> Hunted like a crocodile <eos> Ravaged in the corn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Suddenly I turned around <eos> And she was standing there <eos> With silver bracelets on her wrists <eos> And flowers in her hair <eos> She walked up to me so gracefully <eos> And took my crown of thorns <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Now there's a wall between us <eos> Something there's been lost <eos> I took too much for granted <eos> I got my signals crossed <eos> Just to think that it all began <eos> On an uneventful morn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Well the deputy walks on hard nails <eos> And the preacher rides a mount <eos> But nothing really matters much <eos> It's doom alone that counts <eos> And the one-eyed undertaker <eos> He blows a futile horn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm <eos> I've heard newborn babies wailing <eos> Like a mourning dove <eos> And old men with broken teeth <eos> Stranded without love <eos> Do I understand your question, then <eos> Is it hopeless and forlorn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> In a little hilltop village <eos> They gambled for my clothes <eos> I bargained for salvation <eos> And she gave me a lethal dose <eos> I offered up my innocence <eos> And I got repaid with scorn <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> Well, I'm living in a foreign country <eos> But I'm bound to cross the line <eos> Beauty walks a razor's edge <eos> Someday I'll make it mine <eos> If I could only turn back the clock <eos> To when God and her were born <eos> "Come in," she said, "I'll give ya <eos> Shelter from the storm" <eos> 
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine <eos> Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything <eos> When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes <eos> Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild <eos> When she drives me wild <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out <eos> Till she changes her mind <eos> Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV" <eos> And she falls asleep <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She's unpredictable, unforgettable <eos> It's unusual, unbelievable <eos> How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy <eos> But her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> Her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> 
De los Corredones originales <eos> Con mis compas de Grupo Firme <eos> Dice, más o menos, así <eos> Yo no soy lúcido, mucho menos presumido <eos> Pero sí me doy a respetar <eos> A los envidiosos vieran cómo los detesto <eos> Porque nomás hablan por hablar <eos> Pacas de billetes, produciendo diariamente <eos> Pues, mi meta ha sido duplicar <eos> Odio las mentiras, pero adoro a mi familia <eos> Y por ellos yo voy a luchar <eos> Y la Cruz de Elota llevo en mi pecho <eos> Ranchito que no he de olvidar <eos> Revivir mi infancia, pero ya tengo ganancias <eos> Y, gracias a Dios, ya andamos bien vestidos <eos> Zapatito' fino' los que me ven aportar <eos> Ahorita andamos bateando, poco a poco progresando <eos> Y nadie me va a tumbar <eos> Y pura Marca MP con Bachato <eos> Así suena Grupo Firme, compa' Edwin (Uh) <eos> Y la Banda Nuevo Estilo, mi viejo <eos> Y puro music VIP, viejo <eos> Puro art and music, viejo <eos> No soy traficante, pero festejo a lo grande <eos> Y con amigos jalo un buen bandón <eos> Tengo mil veinte años y el que ocupe de mi mano <eos> Tendrá cien por ciento mi apoyo <eos> Ni rico ni pobre, pero tengo lo que quiero <eos> Y mis gustos siempre me los doy <eos> Mucho le agradezco al viejón por sus consejos <eos> Y por todo lo que me inculcó <eos> Y mientras hay que disfrutar la vida <eos> Porque cualquier día se nos va <eos> Muchas cosas me han pasado <eos> Pero nunca me he quebrado <eos> Y todo gracias al Señor de arriba <eos> Que me cuida y me protege todo el tiempo del mal <eos> Por el valle ruleteando, en mi carro ando zumbando <eos> El güero, se oye mentar <eos> Ahí nomás, pa' las Cocas (Uh) <eos>

"So while you're fixing up your bed <eos> So while you’re organizing drawers <eos> Could you just listen to the problems had <eos> With problems of yours? <eos> And what’s that note you’re writing there? <eos> Why are you giving me this back? <eos> This was a gift from when we met <eos> Back when you weren’t so upset" <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> The sight of your body made me feel uncomfortable <eos> I couldn’t recognize your shell <eos> Your branching off had met an end <eos> From all the weight that made you bend <eos> And when you tried to shed your leaves <eos> You pined for warmth as they said <eos> “Your lack of love for your dear self <eos> Is sapping all of us here out! <eos> Trace your roots back to the ground <eos> Work out the knotholes for yourself” <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> The sight of your family made me feel responsible <eos> And I found the notes you left behind <eos> Little hints and helpless cries <eos> Desperate wishing to be over <eos> You said you’re trapped in your body <eos> And getting deeper every day <eos> They diagnosed you born that way <eos> They say it runs in your family <eos> A conscious erasure of working-class background <eos> Where despair trickles down <eos> Imbalanced chemical crutch <eos> Open up, swallow down <eos> You said “Remember me for me <eos> I need to set my spirit free” <eos> I called in sick from your funeral <eos> (I called in sick, I called in sick) <eos> Tradition of closure nearly felt impossible <eos> (I called in sick, I called in sick) <eos> I should have never gave my word to you <eos> Not a cry, not a sound <eos> Might have learned how to swim <eos> But never taught how to drown <eos> You said “Remember me for me" <eos> I watched you set your spirit free <eos> 
Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo <eos> Caigo de nuevo en tu red <eos> Sé que tarda un tiempo <eos> Curarme de ti de una vez <eos> Tuve tantos momentos felices <eos> Que olvido lo triste que fue <eos> Darte de mi alma <eos> Lo que tú echaste a perder <eos> Yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> Y en la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Tienes, la misma culpa que tengo <eos> Aunque te cueste admitir <eos> Que sientes como siento <eos> La almohada no suele mentir <eos> Y yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer <eos> Cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> 
The last time we met was down at the Tap Room <eos> Mezcal on Sunday with tears in our eyes <eos> You sang me a song sweet as a monsoon blowing in from the South <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> I sat on the hill near the mission <eos> Where lovers meet and when poppies bloom <eos> I followed the ranchers rambling down Broadway <eos> Selling crops on the side of the road <eos> Their hearts in Sonora whenever it rains and wherever they roam <eos> Takе this charm and dry your tears <eos> Won't you wear it to easе your mind <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> Heard the radio blaring a sad corrido <eos> "La tierra del sol suspiro por verte <eos> Quisiera llorar, quisiera morrir" <eos> Come this November's Procession <eos> Mezcal on Sunday with tears in our eyes <eos> 'Cause it's foolish to laugh and pointless to cry <eos> About some old photos buried inside the cracked and crumbling walls <eos> Take this charm and dry your tears <eos> Won't you wear it to ease your mind <eos> Take a breath to soothe your sorrows <eos> Until they're gone, gone as the years fade away <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> 
Only the victim remains the victim <eos> While the truth slips thru the system <eos> Yet the goodness never sees the light of day <eos> So we fight for what is right <eos> Against injustice day and night <eos> To achieve this goal that's the only way <eos> Somebody's colorful <eos> Someone is faceless <eos> Someone is powerful <eos> Somebody's tasteless <eos> This one, that one, the other one <eos> We all are beautiful let's face it <eos> If you ask my name <eos> I'll the youth same, Justice! <eos> We're looking for truth <eos> To save all the youth, Justice! <eos> To stop the radical way of strife <eos> Which matters to every life <eos> Then we'll see the end of all that is wrong <eos> Change your mindset <eos> Change the laws <eos> Change your concept <eos> Even the flaws <eos> So together, we can all stand tall <eos> Somebody's colorful <eos> Someone is faceless <eos> Someone if powerful <eos> Somebody's tasteless <eos> This one, that one, the other one <eos> We all are beautiful let's face it <eos> We can change it <eos> If you ask me my name <eos> I'll tell you the same, Justice! <eos> We're looking for truth <eos> To save all the youth, Justice! <eos> Let's make up our mind <eos> We don't have much time, Justice! <eos> There's no one to blame, we are all the same, Justice! <eos> : <eos> Yeah from Ferguson to Baton Rough <eos> There's a target on your back if you're Black or a Latin dude <eos> Women can get it too <eos> These animals don't have a clue <eos> They'll pack you in a pine box while they're back in their black and blues <eos> Hiding behind a badge <eos> Alibi is ironclad <eos> While children are dying fast <eos> Treated like expired trash (yeah!) <eos> There no substance <eos> We call it JUSTICE <eos> No rhyme or reason or purpose <eos> Why they murk these kids <eos> More than excessive force <eos> It'll take your breath of course <eos> He didn't have a weapon <eos> But he's aggresively stepping towards <eos> Trigger happy savages <eos> Targeting inner city inhabitants <eos> Our so called authority is embarrassing maaan!! <eos> Go get the Kerosene can <eos> And burn it down again <eos> Ain't no comparison <eos> This land is drowning in <eos> Racist rhetoric in the fact of true, Justice! <eos> It's really JUST US <eos> RAISE UP A CLUTCHED FIST <eos> THIS ISN'T JUSTICE <eos> THIS SHIT'S DISGUSTING <eos> 
I wore makeup when we dated <eos> 'Cause I thought you'd like me more <eos> If I looked like the other prom queens <eos> I know that you loved before <eos> Tried so hard to be everything that you liked <eos> Just for you to say you're not the compliment type <eos> And I knew how you took your coffee <eos> And your favorite songs by heart <eos> I read all of your self-help books <eos> So you'd think that I was smart <eos> Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me <eos> I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave <eos> You found someonе more exciting <eos> The nеxt second, you were gone <eos> And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong <eos> And you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you <eos> Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you <eos> And maybe I'm just not as interesting <eos> As the girls you had before <eos> But God, you couldn't have cared less <eos> About someone who loved you more <eos> I'd say you broke my heart <eos> But you broke much more than that <eos> Now I don't want your sympathy <eos> I just want myself back <eos> Before you found someone more exciting <eos> The next second, you were gone <eos> And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong <eos> And you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough <eos> And don't you think I loved you too much <eos> To be used and discarded? <eos> Don't you think I loved you too much <eos> To think I deserve nothing? <eos> But don't tell me you're sorry, boy <eos> Feel sorry for yourself <eos> 'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else <eos> And they'll think that I am so exciting <eos> Then you'll be the one who's crying <eos> Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied <eos> But I don't think that's true <eos> You say I'm never satisfied <eos> But that's not me, it's you <eos> 'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough <eos> But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you <eos> Enough for you, oh <eos> No, nothing's enough for you <eos>

This was never the way I planned <eos> Not my intention <eos> I got so brave, drink in hand <eos> Lost my discretion <eos> It's not what I'm used to <eos> Just wanna try you on <eos> I'm curious for you <eos> Caught my attention <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos> No, I don't even know your name <eos> It doesn't matter <eos> You're my experimental game <eos> Just human nature <eos> It's not what good girls do <eos> Not how they should behave <eos> My head gets so confused <eos> Hard to obey <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos> Us girls, we are so magical <eos> Soft skin, red lips, so kissable <eos> Hard to resist, so touchable <eos> Too good to deny it <eos> Ain't no big deal, it's innocent <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos>

When I was a boy I learned not to cry <eos> My daddy would scream <eos> I learned how to hide <eos> That fool cut off this ribbon of mine <eos> Leading me back before we unwind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> I learned how to do better each time <eos> I buried this heart and years went on by <eos> But what do you do when there's nothing inside? <eos> Lost in the dirt covered in vines <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> This bone will break along a line <eos> Been drawn for a long time <eos> Time <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos>

She's comin for you <eos> Hear the chains rattle <eos> Turn you into a slave <eos> Another piece of chattel <eos> Across the seas <eos> Stormy waters <eos> Showed no mercy <eos> She was satan’s daughter <eos> Born to steal <eos> With bodies to sell <eos> She had her own special <eos> Place in hell <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> She took souls <eos> On a horrible trip <eos> Her morning song <eos> Was the crack of a whip <eos> Ones who survived <eos> Died a long time ago <eos> Most of them buried <eos> Out at old plateau <eos> But the pain and the memory <eos> Will never go away <eos> Her spirits still lives <eos> By the shores of the bay <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' with her ghost <eos> She was a dirty secret <eos> Forgot but not forgiven <eos> But the shame was so great <eos> She could not stay hidden <eos> She's on fire.... <eos> Her flame no longer lights up atnight <eos> Now dreams survive and hope burns bright <eos> People still come from miles around <eos> To praise the folks of africatown <eos> Who rose from the ashes of sad history <eos> To stand unchained proud and free <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' <eos> We’re still livin' <eos> With her ghost <eos>

Unholy slumber on the night of your demise <eos> As countless bloody memories come streaming through your eyes <eos> Come to my haunted house - I'll give you what you crave <eos> You're only half - way dead with one foot in your grave <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> The shock upon your face betrays your grim surprise <eos> Your doom is playing out as I've so often fantasized <eos> You must have known that your deceitful life would end this way <eos> I stand above you laughing on your execution day <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos> A choir of rotting angels singing haunting requiems <eos> I see her in the fog as I go walking through the graveyard <eos> My mind replays so many fright-nights come and gone <eos> I'm covered in your blood, I've waited for this for so long <eos> Now I lay thee down to rest, your visage twisted in distress <eos> Your broken corpse is fucking dead and boring me <eos> My darkest fantasies are manifesting in the flesh <eos> I seal in bloody death this bitter love undying <eos> Unholy rapture of the most horrific kind <eos> I'm finally free now that you've met up with my chainsaw <eos> I carved a pentagram into your soft white skin <eos> And spilled your guts upon our hallowed haunting grounds <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos>

I saw Mommy kissin' Santa Claus <eos> Underneath the mistletoe last night <eos> She didn't see me creep <eos> Down the stairs to have a peep <eos> She thought that I was tucked up <eos> In my bedroom, fast asleep <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> 
Otra noche que promete <eos> Ser igual de cruel <eos> Para mi corazon <eos> Una mas que pasare <eos> Sin escuchar tu voz <eos> Otra dosis de agonia <eos> Y yo sin encontrar <eos> Alguna solucion <eos> Todo me recuerda a ti <eos> En esta habitacion <eos> Esta casa que ha vivido <eos> En carne propia nuestro amor <eos> Cada cuadro que pusimos <eos> El jarron junto al sillon <eos> Las caricias que nos dimos <eos> Antes de decir adios <eos> Y esta foto, la primera de los dos <eos> No sabes como duele la vida <eos> No sabes como duele tu adios <eos> Yo se que nisiquiera imaginas <eos> El dano que me has hecho, mi amor <eos> No sabes como duele perderte <eos> No sabes come duele aceptar <eos> Que para mi es urgente olvidarte <eos> Y no tengo valor para empezar <eos> 
I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way <eos> Seems like yesterday <eos> I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away <eos> I've never been the same <eos> I felt the strangest feeling <eos> Like a raging fire it burned <eos> She left, I cried for weeks <eos> And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away <eos> Had to earn my pay <eos> Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say <eos> It only ended up the same way <eos> And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone? <eos> Oh, girl, you answered my question <eos> This time it's working, you've given me new hope <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you <eos> It's got a power of its own <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> (Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho <eos> (Love changes) Let's make love <eos> (Love changes everything) Oh <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl (Love changes) <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> 
Sorry <eos> Is all that you can't say <eos> Years gone by and still <eos> Words don't come easily <eos> Like sorry, like sorry <eos> Forgive me <eos> Is all that you can't say <eos> Years gone by and still <eos> Words don't come easily <eos> Like forgive me, forgive me <eos> But you can say baby <eos> Baby can I hold you tonight <eos> Maybe if I told you the right words <eos> At the right time <eos> You'd be mine <eos> I love you <eos> Is all that you can't say <eos> Years gone by and still <eos> Words don't come easily <eos> Like I love you, I love you <eos> But you can say baby <eos> Baby can I hold you tonight <eos> Maybe if I told you the right words <eos> At the right time, you'd be mine <eos> Baby can I hold you tonight <eos> Maybe if I told you the right words <eos> At the right time, you'd be mine <eos> You'd be mine <eos> You'd be mine <eos> 
Uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her uptown world <eos> I bet she never had a back street guy <eos> I bet her mama never told her why <eos> I'm gonna try for an uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> And when she knows what <eos> She wants from her time <eos> And when she wakes up <eos> And makes up her mind <eos> She'll see I'm not so tough <eos> Just because <eos> I'm in love with an uptown girl <eos> You know I've seen her in her uptown world <eos> She's getting tired of her high-class toys <eos> And all her presents from her uptown boys <eos> She's got a choice <eos> Uptown girl <eos> You know I can't afford to buy her pearls <eos> But maybe someday when my ship comes in <eos> She'll understand what kind of guy I've been <eos> And then I'll win <eos> And when she's walking <eos> She's looking so fine <eos> And when she's talking <eos> She'll say that she's mine <eos> She'll say I'm not so tough <eos> Just because <eos> I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> Uptown girl <eos> She's my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> 
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore <eos> But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before <eos> And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen <eos> And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans <eos> I asked her what's a woman like you doing here <eos> I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer <eos> She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem <eos> And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans <eos> She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls <eos> But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl <eos> So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream <eos> And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans <eos> We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through <eos> I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true <eos> As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed <eos> A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans <eos> In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say <eos> I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways <eos> And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen <eos> That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine <eos> But I know I’ll always remember the time <eos> A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream <eos> And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos>

Yeah <eos> Pack your bags 'cause we got no reason to lay low <eos> What was my line? <eos> Fuck it <eos> Two, three, go <eos> Sing <eos> La-la-la <eos> You always said I'd be a disappointment <eos> That I'd be nothing and I'd probably lose it all <eos> You thought that I would trip and fall <eos> But you'll never see me beg or crawl <eos> Can't take it, won't fake it, punch a hole through the wall, try to break it <eos> Can't change it, rearrange it, so I guess that I'll just have to face it <eos> This is bloody knuckles and I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain, yeah <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> Another day, another disappointment <eos> My head is tripping, might as well just slip away <eos> You all think I'm crazy anyway <eos> You all think I'm crazy <eos> Won't give in, never fit in, it's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> You dig in, don't pretend, I'm already down, but you keep on pushing <eos> Life is a fight, but you don't ever fight fair <eos> Beat us to the ground, but we will never stay there <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> I won't give in, never fit in <eos> It's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> This is bloody knuckles, I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain <eos> Away from all this pain <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> 
I really can't stay (Baby I'm fine with that) <eos> I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that) <eos> This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe) <eos> So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time) <eos> My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming) <eos> Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming) <eos> So really I'd better scurry (No rush) <eos> Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?) <eos> The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl) <eos> What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix) <eos> I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out) <eos> To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about) <eos> I ought to say no, no, no (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to) <eos> Baby it's cold outside <eos> I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here) <eos> Say, where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear) <eos> You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again) <eos> Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?) <eos> We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience) <eos> At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die) <eos> I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night) <eos> 
I took my love, I took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain <eos> And I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart <eos> Rise above? <eos> Can I sail through <eos> The changing ocean tides <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Oooooooh Ooooooooh <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder <eos> Even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makеs you bolder <eos> Even children gеt older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> So take my love, take it down <eos> Climbed a mountain <eos> And turned around <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> The landslide will bring you down <eos>

Now when I think about it <eos> Never been in love before, no, no <eos> Whenever we talk about it <eos> I question if I'm sure <eos> And now when I think about us <eos> And everything that we are <eos> I'm closer now to acceptance <eos> And I won't cry no more, no, no <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Though we never really talked about it <eos> I never been in love before <eos> But this is something I know <eos> ‘Cause now I don't cry no more <eos> No more, no more, no more <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else, yeah <eos> Living without you <eos> Can we make it through? <eos> What else would I do? <eos> Alone without you <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> Try to live my life without you <eos> You know I won't <eos> Can't pretend I never loved you <eos> You know I'd be lying <eos> How can something become nothing? <eos> Or has this just become something else? <eos> Now we're something else <eos> 
It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark <eos> When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park <eos> I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear <eos> Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer <eos> But then I was illin' because the man had a beard <eos> And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared <eos> So I turned my head a second and the man was gone <eos> But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn <eos> I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause <eos> Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus" <eos> A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's <eos> Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease <eos> But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right <eos> So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night <eos> But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree <eos> Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me <eos> It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens <eos> Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens <eos> Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese <eos> And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees <eos> Decorate the house with lights at night <eos> Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright <eos> In the fireplace is the yule log <eos> Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog <eos> The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's <eos> But each and every year we bust Christmas carols <eos> (Christmas melodies) <eos> Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it <eos> It's Christmas time and we got the spirit <eos> Jack Frost chillin', the orchid’s out <eos> And that's what Christmas is all about <eos> The time is now, the place is here <eos> And the whole wide world is filled with cheer <eos> My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand <eos> And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman <eos> So open your eyes, lend us an ear <eos> We want to say <eos> Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! <eos>

I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> I wish you could have seen us <eos> Begging for change to get home <eos> Or at least San Francisco <eos> Let's put a ten on the high card <eos> And spend a summer on the West Coast <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you (memories) <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue (memories) <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you (memories) <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos>

When we were young and still in love <eos> We didn't care what we were made of <eos> Our eyes were set on a distant sun <eos> It was shimmering gold <eos> Then slowly one by one <eos> We carried our past and cradled the storm <eos> We tried to conceal the scars we wore <eos> 'Cause we couldn't show what we couldn't show <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments we share <eos> Love's truest meaning lives when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> And then the silence fell <eos> We bit our tongues, with which we tell <eos> All of our dreams, and the stories we sell <eos> But we didn't know what we didn't know <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> 
Home sweet <eos> Touching down, from a six night honeymoon <eos> Sun kissed kids, still drunk on love <eos> Went from, all-inclusive margaritas in Malibu <eos> To praying we could pay rent this month <eos> That doormat says "Welcome Home" <eos> But I think it's wherever I’m with you <eos> It's more than some bricks and stones <eos> No, there ain't nothing like <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain't nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet <eos> You and me <eos> Your love is like, a porch swing on Sunday <eos> Just as gentle as a summer sunrise <eos> They say "It's where the heart is", well, mine's with you, babe <eos> Long as I got your hand, I'm fine, yeah <eos> Could be white brick and picket fences <eos> Or some busted AC hotel room <eos> It's all picture perfect if you're in it <eos> No, it don't get much better than <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> A quarter acre and a two-bed farmhouse <eos> Polaroid kiss, with the red sold sign <eos> Sitting on boxes in the living room laughing and crying <eos> Just staring at them two pink lines, huh <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> Time to make a little more room in our <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Yeah, we got it all and you're still all I need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me, yeah (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos>

I hate the way it feels, it is my fear <eos> To be running in circles just to stand still <eos> I need the chaos, I crave the thrill <eos> Feeling its pain is the only thing real <eos> I let it throw its best shots at me <eos> It can punch me in the face, it only sets me free <eos> And I would take a thousand cuts to the throat <eos> Before I live another day in mediocrity <eos> I, I don't belong here <eos> I, I don't belong here <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ridе <eos> But I will choose the crooked linе <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> It's fucking bullshit, I know what I'm seeing <eos> It is a time bomb ticking and I'm heading right to it <eos> It holds me, I don't wanna leave <eos> I've got an itch for the drug <eos> Do anything to consume it <eos> I may crash and burn over and over again <eos> I see the danger around but I'm a masochist <eos> I'm not one to be ashamed <eos> There is no going back, this is the road I've made <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I am all that I have left <eos> I'm understanding <eos> Just not wired like the rest <eos> It's liberating <eos> I am all that I have left <eos> So understand me <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> Not gonna waste my time <eos> Provoked and ready, last chance, I am fucking going off <eos> (Don't even try) <eos> (Don't even try) <eos> I'm ripping up the noise that has been tearing up me <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I'm surrounded by everything that I don't want to be (Don't want to be) <eos> The sound is suffocating <eos> It's nothing but static, it's nothing but static, it's deafening <eos> I could take the easy ride <eos> But I will choose the crooked line <eos> The noise builds up around me <eos> It's all just static, it's all so deafening <eos> I'm not wired like the rest <eos>

I see the crystal raindrops fall <eos> And the beauty of it all <eos> Is when the sun comes shining through <eos> To make those rainbows in my mind <eos> When I think of you sometime <eos> And I want to spend some time with you <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building castles in the sky <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> We look for love, no time for tears <eos> Wasted water's all that is <eos> And it don't make no flowers grow <eos> Good things might come to those who wait <eos> Not for those who wait too late <eos> We gotta go for all we know <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building them castles in the sky <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> I hear the crystal raindrops fall <eos> On the window down the hall <eos> And it becomes the morning dew <eos> And, darling, when the morning comes <eos> And I see the morning sun <eos> I want to be the one with you <eos> Just the two of us <eos> We can make it if we try <eos> Just the two of us <eos> (Just the two of us) <eos> Just the two of us <eos> Building big castles way up high <eos> Just the two of us <eos> You and I <eos> 
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat <eos> I can hear you breathing near my ear <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> Anytime you want to you can turn me onto <eos> Anything you want to, anytime at all <eos> When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver <eos> Can't control the quivering inside <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter <eos> My whole world could shatter, I don't care <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> Oh, oh-oh-oh <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> 
Elle avait des bagues à chaque doigt <eos> Des tas de bracelets autour des poignets <eos> Et puis elle chantait avec une voix <eos> Qui, sitôt, m'enjôla <eos> Elle avait des yeux, des yeux d'opale <eos> Qui m'fascinaient, qui m'fascinaient <eos> Y avait l'ovale de son visage pâle <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus d'vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est réchauffés <eos> Puis on s'est séparés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir, aïe, aïe, aïe! <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Au son des banjos je l'ai reconnu <eos> Ce curieux sourire qui m'avait tant plu <eos> Sa voix si fatale, son beau visage pâle <eos> M'émurent plus que jamais <eos> Je me suis soûlé en l'écoutant <eos> L'alcool fait oublier le temps <eos> Je me suis réveillé en sentant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus de vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est séparés <eos> Puis on s'est réchauffés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir ah là là <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Quand on s'est connus <eos> Quand on s'est reconnus <eos> Pourquoi s'perdre de vue <eos> Se reperdre de vue? <eos> Quand on s'est retrouvés <eos> Quand on s'est réchauffés <eos> Pourquoi se séparer? <eos> Alors tous deux, on est repartis <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> On a continué à tourner <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> 
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I'll never kill myself to save my soul) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I didn't come this far to sink so low) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> I'm just weathering a rough patch <eos> Another villain with an itch to scratch <eos> Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole <eos> Why does the hell make you feel so cold? <eos> Make a move and you pay for it <eos> Pick a lord and you pray to it <eos> You're so demanding when you want the truth <eos> But your stories don't read for me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> Indecision overload <eos> Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road <eos> Reaching out for the hand of God <eos> But did you think you'd shake your own? <eos> This killing field is all grown over <eos> The motherfucker wants it wild <eos> Go sow your oats in alphabetical order <eos> The anti-antagonist is back in style <eos> Myopic, cannot see straight <eos> Dystopic, one sin too late <eos> You gotta lie if you wanna believe <eos> But your bibles don't work on me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting <eos> Go <eos> Did you think you could win? And fill me in? <eos> Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin <eos> I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me <eos> I was more than you thought I could be <eos> So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos>

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Forget everything you've seen on television and in the movies. There's not gonna be any last minute surprise witnesses. Nobody's gonna break down on the stand with a tearful confession. You're gonna be presented with a simple fact: Andrew Beckett was fired. You'll hear two explanations for why he was fired: ours and theirs. It is up to you to sift through layer upon layer of truth until you determine for yourselves which version sounds the most true. There are certain points that I must prove to you. <eos> Point number one, Andrew Beckett was - is a brilliant lawyer, great lawyer. Point number two, Andrew Beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made the understandable, the personal, the legal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself. Point number three, his employers discovered his illness, and ladies and gentlemen, the illness I am referring to is AIDS. Point number four, they panicked. And in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with AIDS, which is just get it, and everybody who has it, as far away from the rest of us as possible. <eos> Now, the behavior of Andrew Beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you. It does to me. After all, AIDS is a deadly, incurable disease. But no matter how you come to judge Charles Wheeler and his partners in ethical, moral, and inhuman terms, the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett because he had AIDS, they broke the law. <eos>

Find your feet <eos> Don't look down <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> We can't climb <eos> If we're intertwined <eos> Oh, I never would have thought we were holding on <eos> For too long <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Trust these words <eos> Though I get a little tongue-tied sometimes <eos> We're worth <eos> More than I ever could know <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> And you might just say that you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me 'cos we can't see <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> Like the first time and now I leave <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me again <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> 
What will it take? <eos> What will it take <eos> To rip the heart from your hate? <eos> It's easy to be right <eos> When everything repeats <eos> It's easier to cut us down and point at our defeat <eos> It's easy to be right <eos> When everything repeats <eos> Dig below the surface, find your insecurities <eos> Tell me <eos> Maybe you were right <eos> Maybe I was wrong <eos> But I've been silent for far too long <eos> Maybe you were right <eos> Maybe I should go <eos> But I've been silent for far too long <eos> What will it take <eos> To rip the heart from your hate? <eos> What will it take? <eos> What will it take <eos> To rip the heart from your hate? (Hate) <eos> To rip the heart from your hate (Hate) <eos> To rip the heart from your hate <eos> You always walk away <eos> Soon, you'll have to face it <eos> Your distance from reality <eos> Won't bury or erase it <eos> I tried to do the same <eos> Living so complacent <eos> But the problems wouldn't go away <eos> So I turned around to face them <eos> Tell me <eos> Maybe you were right <eos> Maybe I was wrong <eos> But I've been silent for far too long <eos> Maybe you were right <eos> Maybe I should go <eos> But I've been silent for far too long <eos> What will it take <eos> To rip the heart from your hate? <eos> What will it take? <eos> What will it take <eos> To rip the heart from your hate?

I'm lost in the light <eos> I pray for the night <eos> To take me, to take you too <eos> After so many words <eos> Still nothing's heard <eos> Don't know what we should do <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> 'twas my greatest thrill <eos> When we just stood still <eos> You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill <eos> Even counting sheep <eos> Don't help me sleep <eos> I just toss and turn right there beside ya <eos> So if someone could help me now <eos> They'd help you too <eos> They'd help you too <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> And I held my own <eos> Still I rattled your bones <eos> I said some awful things and I take them back <eos> If we would try again <eos> Just remember when <eos> Before we were lovers I swear we were friends <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> Let them see you <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> 
There's a reason for the sun-shining sky <eos> And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high <eos> Must be the season when that <eos> Love light shines all around us <eos> So, let that feeling grab you deep inside <eos> And send you reeling where your love can't hide <eos> And then go stealing <eos> Through the moonlit nights with your lover <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> There's a reason for the warm sweet nights <eos> And there's a reason for the candlelights <eos> Must be the season when those <eos> Love lights shine all around us <eos> So, let that wonder take you into space <eos> And lay you under its loving embrace <eos> Just feel the thunder as it warms your face <eos> You can't hold back <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos> With the smallest of dreams <eos> And let your love show <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> It's the season <eos> Let your love fly <eos> Like a bird on a wing <eos> And let your love bind you <eos> To all living things <eos> And let your love shine <eos> And you'll know what I mean <eos> That's the reason <eos> Just let your love flow <eos> Like a mountain stream <eos> And let your love grow <eos>

Me dira basta ya <eos> Y se ira de mi lado <eos> Yo la vi junto a el <eos> Comprendi que habia perdido <eos> Sus ojos le gritaban que lo amaban <eos> Como hace mucho que no hace conmigo <eos> Me mira hoy con pena por que sabe <eos> Que la amo locamente como ayer <eos> Recuerdo aquella luna en su cuarto <eos> El viento acarisiandole la cara <eos> Cuando eramos felicez de estar juntos <eos> Y ahora otro sueño nos separa <eos> Llorare <eos> Quizas si quizas no se no lloras tu <eos> Escribire <eos> Quizas si quizas no si me escribes tu <eos> Mienteme <eos> No me importa creer lo que digas tu <eos> Olvidare <eos> No te he visto con el si lo juras tu <eos> No ves que estoy llorando como un niño como un mendigo pido tu cariño <eos> No tengo dignidad ni tengo orgullo por que te amo mucho mas que eso <eos> Como a dios mismo te estoy rogando eres mi vida no me abandones <eos> 
Hadn't had a good time <eos> Since you know when <eos> Got talked into going out <eos> With hopes you were staying in <eos> I was feeling like myself for the first time <eos> In a long time <eos> 'Til I bumped into some of your friends <eos> Over there talkin' to mine <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Knew it was gonna be a long night <eos> From the moment when <eos> We locked eyes over whiskey on ice <eos> Started talking 'bout us again <eos> If I would've just laid my drink down <eos> And walked out <eos> I wouldn't be in my truck <eos> Driving us to your house <eos> But you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Yeah, you hit me Category 5 <eos> With your smile <eos> Blew me away <eos> And girl, it ain't but midnight <eos> You done killed the lights <eos> Bent my heart back to your bedside <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> 'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart storming <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> 
En la Puerta del Sol <eos> Como el año que fue <eos> Otra vez el champagne y las uvas y el alquitrán <eos> De alfombra están <eos> Los petardos que borran sonidos de ayer <eos> Y acaloran el ánimo para aceptar <eos> Que ya pasó uno más <eos> Y en el reloj de antaño, como de año en año <eos> Cinco minutos más para la cuenta atrás <eos> Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo <eos> Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás <eos> Marineros, soldados, solteros, casados <eos> Amantes, andantes y alguno que otro <eos> Cura despistao Eh <eos> Entre gritos y pitos los españolitos <eos> Enormes, bajitos hacemos por una vez <eos> Algo a la vez <eos> Mmm no <eos> Y en el reloj de antaño, como de año en año Eh <eos> Cinco minutos más para la cuenta atrás Eh ey <eos> Hacemos el balance de lo bueno y malo Mmm <eos> Cinco minutos antes de la cuenta atrás <eos> Aunque para las uvas hay algunos nuevos <eos> A los que ya no están echaremos de menos <eos> Ya ver si espabilamos los que estamos vivos <eos> Y en el año que viene nos reímos <eos> Uno, dos, tres y cuatro y empieza otra vez <eos> Que la quinta es la una y la sexta es la dos <eos> Y así el siete es tres Uooh <eos> Y decimos adiós y pedimos a Dios <eos> Que en el año que viene <eos> A ver si en vez de un millón <eos> Pueden ser dos <eos> En la Puerta del Sol <eos> Como el año que fue <eos> Otra vez el champagne y las uvas y el alquitrán <eos> De alfombra están <eos> 
Letra de "Dígale" <eos> No ha podido olvidar mi corazón <eos> Aquellos ojos tristes soñadores que yo amé <eos> La dejé por conquistar una ilusión <eos> Y perdí su rastro, y ahora sé que es ella <eos> Todo lo que yo buscaba <eos> Y ahora estoy aqui <eos> Buscándola de nuevo <eos> Ya no está, se fue <eos> Tal vez usted la ha visto digale <eos> Que yo siempre la adoré <eos> Y que nunca la olvidé <eos> Que mi vida es un desierto y muero yo de sed <eos> Y digale también, que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar <eos> No hay brillo en las estrellas <eos> Ya ni el sol, me calienta <eos> Y estoy muy solo aqui, no sé a donde fue <eos> Por favor digale usted <eos> Fueron tantos los momentos que la amé <eos> Que siento sus caricias y su olor esta en mi piel <eos> Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mi <eos> La cubría de besos, y entre mil caricias <eos> La llevaba a la locura <eos> * CORO <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
He came from somewhere back in her long ago <eos> The sentimental fool don't see <eos> Tryin' hard to recreate <eos> What had yet to be created once in her life <eos> She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale <eos> Never coming near what he wanted to say <eos> Only to realize it never really was <eos> She had a place in his life <eos> He never made her think twice <eos> As he rises to her apology <eos> Anybody else would surely know <eos> He's watching her go <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos> Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago <eos> Where he can still believe there's a place in her life <eos> Someday, somewhere <eos> She will return <eos> She had a place in his life <eos> He never made her think twice <eos> As he rises to her apology <eos> Anybody else would surely know <eos> He's watching her go <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos>

At a certain speed on the interstate <eos> Everything looks the same <eos> The blurry green helps me meditate <eos> When everything's always changing <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I took a ride down the boulеvard <eos> To see where we usеd to hang <eos> It's worn down like the rest of us <eos> But that's a quick coat o' paint <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> My mind's racing <eos> Yeah, I just need some four-wheel isolation <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I can't afford that vacation <eos> And you can't see the skyline from the basement <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need (We got everything we need) <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me (You know you got me) <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need, yeah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 
It might not be the right time <eos> I might not be the right one <eos> But there's something about us I want to say <eos> 'Cause there's something between us anyway <eos> I might not be the right one <eos> It might not be the right time <eos> But there's something about us I've got to do <eos> Some kind of secret I will share with you <eos> I need you more than anything in my life <eos> I want you more than anything in my life <eos> I'll miss you more than anyone in my life <eos> I love you more than anyone in my life <eos> 
I've never been one to ask for help <eos> If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself <eos> I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday <eos> Quote you the scripture kind <eos> I'm far from a preacher <eos> But I'm a believer <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> For someone to love me like you do <eos> Graceful eyes to see me through <eos> A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me <eos> A touch that kills me too <eos> And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> Every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain <eos> Girl, even today, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> 
Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon <eos> (How does it feel when you've got no herb?) <eos> You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June <eos> (If you got no herb you will walk an' talk) <eos> So I lef' my gate and went out for a walk <eos> As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I hear them say <eos> (How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?) <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> So I stopped to find out what was going on <eos> (How do you find when you make your stuff?) <eos> For the spirit of Jah, you know he leads me on <eos> (Them all have a leaf at the dreadlocks' camp) <eos> There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing <eos> I could feel the chill as I see and heard them say <eos> (How do dey sing when you heard dem sing?) <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> Pass the kutchie pon the lef' hand side <eos> It a go bun, it a go dung, Jah know <eos> 
Tenemos que hablar <eos> No me cuadra que ya no te sienta igual , hace tiempo que no quieres ni cenar <eos> Y me aterra el que quieras terminar <eos> Por que e dicho te amo y no dices yo mas <eos> Te e dicho te extraño y no dices igual <eos> Se ve en tu cara que hay algo raro <eos> Te pido un beso y me abrasas no mas <eos> Con eso me llenas de inseguridad <eos> Es mas que claro que soy pasado <eos> Se nota de lejos que te quieres ir y me parte el alma el dejarte partir pero es correcto <eos> Si es tu deseo si en tu boca se le hiso el decir adios <eos> Primero anestiesame el corazon que va a dolerme el ya no verte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte <eos> No mientas mi amor tu no eras asi no me engañas por favor <eos> Fue que yo hise algo mal o alguien nuevo te gano y no empiezes con que todo esto lo invento yo <eos> Por que e dicho te amo y no dices yo mas <eos> Te e dicho te extraño y no dices igual <eos> Se ve en tu cara que hay algo raro <eos> Te pido un beso y me abrasas no mas <eos> Con eso me llenas de inseguridad <eos> Es mas que claro que soy pasado <eos> Se nota de lejos que te quieres ir y me parte el alma el dejarte partir pero es correcto <eos> Si es tu deseo si en tu boca se le hiso el decir adios <eos> Primero anestiesame el corazon que va a dolerme el ya no verte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte <eos>

Fuiste tú <eos> Tenerte fue una foto tuya puesta en mi cartera <eos> Un beso y verte hacer pequeño por la carretera <eos> Lo tuyo fue la intermitencia y la melancolía <eos> Lo mío fue aceptarlo todo porque te quería <eos> Verte llegar fue luz, verte partir un blues <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> De más está decir que sobra decir tantas cosas <eos> O aprendes a querer la espina o no aceptes rosas <eos> Jamás te dije una mentira o te inventé un chantaje <eos> Las nubes grises también forman parte del paisaje <eos> Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada más que decir <eos> Solo queda insistir <eos> Dilo <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> La luz de neón del barrio sabe que estoy tan cansada <eos> Me ha visto caminar descalza por la madrugada <eos> Estoy en medio del que soy y del que tú quisieras <eos> Queriendo despertar pensando como no quisiera <eos> Y no me veas así, si hubo un culpable aquí <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendió la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Asi se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada mas que decir <eos> Solo queda insistir <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> Que fácil fue tocar el cielo la primera vez <eos> Cuando los besos fueron el motor de arranque <eos> Que encendio la luz que hoy se desaparece <eos> Así se disfraza el amor para su conveniencia <eos> Aceptando todo sin hacer preguntas <eos> Y dejando al tiempo la estocada a muerte <eos> Nada mas que decir <eos> Si quieres insistir <eos> Fuiste tú <eos> 
Uuuuh <eos> No <eos> No, no, no, no <eos> Yo no sé si tú, no sé si yo <eos> Seguiremos siendo como hoy <eos> No sé si después de amanecer <eos> Vamos a sentir la misma sed <eos> Para qué pensar y suponer <eos> No preguntes cosas que no sé, yo no sé <eos> No sé dónde vamos a parar <eos> Eso ya la piel nos lo dirá <eos> Para qué jurar y prometer algo que no está en nuestro poder <eos> Yo no sé lo que es eterno <eos> No me pidas algo que es del tiempo <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> De un cafe pasamos al sofá <eos> De un botón a todo lo demás <eos> No pusimos reglas ni reloj <eos> Aquí estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Todo lo que ves es lo que soy <eos> No me pidas más de lo que doy, no <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un día vivido <eos> No tratemos de correr antes de andar <eos> Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad <eos> No, oh, no, no sé, oh <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Yo no sé si tú, yo no sé si yo, cómo será el final <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Deja que el corazón decida, vida mía, lo que sentimos <eos> Mañana, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo <eos> Quién puede saber lo que pasará mañana, no hay nada escrito <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos <eos> ¡Oye! <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> 
Hey <eos> This is a story I hate <eos> And tellin' it might make me break <eos> But I'll tell it anyway <eos> This chapter's about <eos> How you said there was nobody else <eos> Then you got up and went to her house <eos> You guys always left me out <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart? <eos> You check in and out <eos> Of my heart like a hotel <eos> And she must be perfect, oh well <eos> I hope you both go to hell <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart) <eos> How could you be so reckless? <eos> How could you be so reckless? <eos> How could you be so reckless with someone's heart? <eos> Hey <eos> This is a story I hate <eos> But I told it to cope with the pain <eos> I'm so sorry if you can relate <eos> 
Oh, yeah <eos> Now, baby, come back <eos> Ooh, you make me feel so good <eos> Baby, come back <eos> I love it when you're in my hood (I can see you want it bad) <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> See I love it, just another feeling <eos> It don't matter if we get along <eos> But, baby, come back <eos> Ooh, you make me feel so good <eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> My baby, keep me hanging on <eos> I can't seem to find my way back home <eos> You lead the way, you're my light, my inspiration <eos> You way you love me, every day's a celebration <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy, falling head to toe <eos> Now, baby, come back (Baby) <eos> I feel it when you're gone too long (Baby, oh) <eos> Baby come back (Baby) <eos> Your loving keeps me going strong (Baby, oh) <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> See I love it, just another feeling <eos> It don't matter if we get along <eos> But, baby, come back (Baby) <eos> Ooh, you make me feel so good (Baby, oh) <eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> My baby, keep me hanging on <eos> I can't seem to find my way back home <eos> You lead the way, you're my light, my inspiration <eos> You way you love me, every day's a celebration <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy, falling head to toe <eos> Never seem to reach you on the phone <eos> You lead the way, you're my light, my inspiration <eos> You way you love me, every day's a celebration <eos> I wanna make you mine, somebody to love <eos> My baby, keep me hanging on <eos> I can't seem to find my way back home <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy, falling head to toe <eos> Never seem to reach you on the phone <eos> 
Do you think you're better off alone? <eos> Do you think you're better off alone? <eos> Do you think you're better off alone? <eos> Do you think you're better off alone? <eos> Talk to me ... Ohhh, talk to me <eos> Talk to me ... Ohhh, talk to me <eos> 
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño <eos> When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino <eos> As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name <eos> Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came <eos> I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school <eos> Never going, never showing up when we had to <eos> Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave <eos> I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall <eos> But what would you expect with a conscience so small? <eos> Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised <eos> Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised <eos> 'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and <eos> Cutting people down is just a minor offense then <eos> It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn <eos> I'm sick of being told to wait my turn <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Don't count on me to let you know when <eos> Don't count on me, I'll do it again <eos> Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing <eos> Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening <eos> Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat <eos> Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing <eos> You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin <eos> But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing <eos> 'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook <eos> You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book <eos> I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion <eos> The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Casualty of society <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Victim of your conformity and back down <eos> 
Maybe it's nice to be alone in the end <eos> You know I'm fine living so close to the edge <eos> Who needs a house when I've got all these friends? <eos> They say: "Are you gonna give up some day?" <eos> "Are you gonna grow up some day?" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Don't need a license when you've got no drive <eos> It feels so right taking the wrong advice <eos> They tell me one day that I'll pay the price <eos> They saying: "Maybe I'll go up in flames" <eos> "Maybe it'll blow up one day" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live my life, live my life <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> 
I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please, have snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents under the tree <eos> Christmas Eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in my dreams <eos> Christmas Eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in, if only in, if only in my dreams <eos>

You're taking what you want right from me <eos> Wrapped up in so much <eos> Life is just the way you hold me <eos> You pick your miscellaneously <eos> Wrapped up in all the choices you're not giving to me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to  fill the empty spaces <eos> You're saying what you want right to me <eos> No filter on your mouth, we know you talk in your sleep <eos> Remembering the times they won't remember me <eos> Our nights melt into sequels, you sink into me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit, just a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of, oh <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> 
Get your motor runnin' <eos> Head out on the highway <eos> Looking for adventure <eos> In whatever comes our way <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> I like smoke and lightnin' <eos> Heavy metal thunder <eos> Racing with the wind <eos> And the feeling that I'm under <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> Like a true nature's child <eos> We were born, born to be wild <eos> We can climb so high <eos> I never wanna die <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Get your motor runnin' <eos> Head out on the highway <eos> Looking for adventure <eos> In whatever comes our way <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> Like a true nature's child <eos> We were born, born to be wild <eos> We can climb so high <eos> I never wanna die <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Born to be wild <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos>

It didn't really take a hundred years to get to twenty-one <eos> It didn't take a whole case of beer to have a little fun <eos> And a fire don't need gasoline and a Black Cat to get lit, nah <eos> But to us it did <eos> That first kiss didn't really get you higher than the moon <eos> And takin' hits off cigarettes didn't really make you cool <eos> That first check from that first job don't really make you rich, naw <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did, yeah <eos> A brand new guitar don't make you a star, and a broken heart don't really break <eos> Don't mean you ain't a man if you didn't cliff jump into that lake <eos> That corner spot in McDonald's lot don't mean a lot to most kids <eos> Ah, but to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> Oh, to us it did, oh <eos> Yeah, runnin' from them blue lights didn't make you Dukes of Hazzard <eos> How hard you punch, how far you hit, it didn't really matter <eos> Oh, wasted time shouldn't qualify for the nights you won't forget, no <eos> But to us it did <eos> Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour <eos> That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big (Yeah) <eos> Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers <eos> Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly <eos> But to us it did <eos> (Our trucks didn't really go two-hundred miles an hour) <eos> (That small town we ran around ain't supposed to feel that big) Oh, it wasn't big <eos> (Shots of Jack and shoulder pads don't give you super powers) <eos> (Wrong don't right, dirt don't shine, time don't fly) <eos> But to us it did <eos> 
I don't care what the neighbors say <eos> Christmas time is near <eos> I don't care what anyone says <eos> Christmas is full of cheer <eos> All I know is that Santa's sleigh <eos> Is makin it's way to the U.S.A <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh <eos> All I know is that Santa Claus <eos> Don't care about breaking no flying laws <eos> I wish it was, I wish it was <eos> Wish it was, wish it was, oh <eos> I don't care about anything else <eos> Christmas is almost here <eos> And I don't care what the news man said <eos> Christmas is full of cheer <eos> I don't care about anything <eos> Except hearing those sleigh bells a'ring-a-ding, ding <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> In the good old U.S. of A <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh <eos> I wish it was Christmas today <eos> I wish it was Christmas today, oh, oh <eos> Santa's bringing goodies to those boys and girls <eos> In every nook and cranny of this crazy ass world <eos> I want it, I want it <eos> I want it, I want it <eos> 
Reason, all my mind is gone and broken <eos> Seizures, I have lost control of my mind... <eos> Deeper, all I do is fall behind my <eos> Reason, I have lost control of my mind, no... <eos> Another dose down my throat <eos> To ease this affliction <eos> And I feel so cold and numb... <eos> Broken,laying on the ground, Inanimate <eos> Embracing a somatic shut down, Reanimate! <eos> Chorus: <eos> Release me from this prison inside my head <eos> A nightmare of manic thoughts I can't escape <eos> Overthinking, a mental overload in cold sweat <eos> Wish I could erase this and just push reset... <eos> "Om gam ganapataye namaha..." <eos> All alone now... On my own now... <eos> This feeling is unreal <eos> My mind is clouded I can't see clear <eos> I can't stand no more how I feel <eos> And I wish I just disappear... <eos> 
I fell by the wayside like everyone else <eos> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself <eos> Our every moment, I start to replace <eos> 'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was never the right time, whenever you called <eos> Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all <eos> Our every moment, I start to replay <eos> But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Would we be better off by now <eos> If I'd have let my walls come down? <eos> Maybe, I guess we'll never know <eos> You know, you know <eos> Before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> 
Lay where you're layin' <eos> Don't make a sound <eos> I know they're watchin' <eos> They're watchin' <eos> All the commotion <eos> The kiddie like play <eos> Have people talkin' <eos> Talkin' <eos> You! <eos> Your sex is on fire <eos> The dark of the alley <eos> The breakin' of day <eos> Head while I'm drivin' <eos> I'm drivin' <eos> Soft lips are open <eos> Them knuckles are pale <eos> Feels like you're dyin' <eos> You're dyin' <eos> You! <eos> Your sex is on fire <eos> Consumed! <eos> With what's just transpired <eos> Hot as a fever <eos> Rattle of Bones <eos> I could just taste it <eos> Taste it <eos> If it's not forever <eos> If it's just tonight <eos> Oh, we're still the greatest <eos> The greatest, the greatest <eos> You! <eos> Your sex is on fire <eos> You! <eos> Your sex is on fire, ahh <eos> Consumed! <eos> With what's to transpire <eos> And you! <eos> Your sex is on fire <eos> Consumed! <eos> With what's to transpire <eos>

The childhood part of my life <eos> It wasn't very pretty <eos> You see, I was born and raised <eos> In the slums of the city <eos> It was a one room shack that slept <eos> Ten other children beside me <eos> We hardly had enough food <eos> Or room to sleep <eos> It was hard times <eos> Needed something to ease <eos> My troubled mind <eos> Mmm, listen <eos> My father didn't know <eos> The meaning of work <eos> He disrespected Mama <eos> And treated us like dirt <eos> I left home seeking a job <eos> That I never did find <eos> Depressed and downhearted <eos> I took to Cloud Nine <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Listen, one more time <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Folks down there tell me <eos> They say, "Give yourself a chance, son <eos> Don't let life pass you by <eos> But the world of reality is a rat race <eos> Where only the strongest survive <eos> It's a dog-eat-dog world <eos> And that ain't no lie <eos> Listen, it ain't even safe no more <eos> To walk the streets at night" <eos> I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine <eos> Let me tell you about Cloud Nine <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And every man, every man is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And you're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> Cloud Nine <eos> I wanna say I love the life I live <eos> And I'm gonna live the life I love <eos> Up here on Cloud Nine <eos> I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high <eos> (On Cloud Nine) <eos> You're as free as a bird in flight <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> There's no difference between day and night <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> It's a world of love and harmony <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> Every man in his mind is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> 
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside <eos> I'm not one of those who can easily hide <eos> I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did <eos> I'd buy a big house where we both could live <eos> If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no <eos> Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show <eos> I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do <eos> My gift is my song, and this one's for you <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss <eos> Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross <eos> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song <eos> It's for people like you that keep it turned on <eos> So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do <eos> You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue <eos> Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean <eos> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> 
The table's set <eos> Bring the baguette <eos> Let's eat while the soup's still wet <eos> It's time for lunch <eos> Lunch! <eos> Can you pass the salt? <eos> I do not have the strength <eos> This musical exhausts me <eos> I'd go to any length to make it stop <eos> Make it stop <eos> Oh, pish-posh <eos> If you to change your mood <eos> Just listen to this dude <eos> As I recall my bygone theater student days <eos> Oh <eos> During my time at Julliard <eos> I learned things every day <eos> (spoken) <eos> Honey, it was one online class <eos> (sung) <eos> Well, be that as it may <eos> One that online schoolyard <eos> We'd sing and dance and play <eos> And I'll always remember the thing my professor would look at us and say: <eos> It doesn't matter if you can sing or if you can't <eos> To make yourself smile, just sing for a while <eos> About the things you want <eos> 
You got somebody and I know, though <eos> But you still can't let me go <eos> No way that you hittin’ me up <eos> You wanted my love <eos> You still wanted us <eos> You out with her, thinkin' of me <eos> We don't dress alike, talk alike, walk alike, act alike, no <eos> She ain’t me, no chemistry <eos> Know you mad I let you go <eos> She don't sauce like me <eos> She don't talk like me <eos> She don't walk like me <eos> Ain't a boss like me <eos> She ain't me <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain’t me, she ain’t me, she ain't me, she ain’t me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain’t me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> Chillin' with my best friend when my ex hit me up <eos> "New number who dis?" 'cause I can't show no love <eos> I know that you're missin' me <eos> Deleted your number from history <eos> Don't want me shadin' your captions <eos> You're postin' your girl and I'm laughin' <eos> You was that nigga, what happened? <eos> You let me go and you slackin' <eos> You ain't shit, go and text your bitch, but remember this <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> Thought I was gon' stick around for you <eos> Through all of this shit, I was down for you <eos> My mama, she told me, "You gotta watch niggas closely" <eos> You been creepin' on the low, textin' bitches I don't know <eos> You downgraded with that hoe, still textin' me but she don't know <eos> You still need me, I know <eos> You can't leave me alone <eos> Ain't nothin' like me, she will never be wifey <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> She can't love you like I do <eos> She don't know you like I do <eos> I won that war just for you <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She can't love you like I do <eos> She don't know you like I do <eos> I won that war just for you <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> She ain't me <eos> (She ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me, she ain't me) <eos> 
You and I, baby <eos> Maybe we can ride away, baby <eos> And I just wanna get inside, baby <eos> But I don't wanna wait forever <eos> Scared that I can't treat you better than her <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don’t overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it's just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah <eos> I wanna know <eos> I wanna know how to feel, what to feel, what's right <eos> I never know <eos> 'Cause when it gets real, I just run away and hide from you <eos> From you <eos> From you, ooh, ooh <eos> So when I'm gonna know what to feel inside, baby? <eos> Maybe it's just all in my head, so <eos> Don't overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it’s just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah <eos> And I just want a good time <eos> But am I wrong for that? No <eos> Am I wrong for that? No, no, yeah <eos> And is it not the right time? <eos> But what's the wrong in that, oh? <eos> Am I wrong for that? No, no, so <eos> Don't overthink, this is love <eos> Maybe it’s just a crush <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? <eos> I hope what I feel is enough <eos> Maybe this is just lust <eos> Baby, is this your love affair, your love affair? Yeah <eos> 
I survived the wasteland of tasting tongues but can't deny <eos> A beacon shined in blistered light for a while <eos> Burning in an open eye <eos> No room for improvement <eos> You're just some muse I use for joy <eos> The version of you I love is some other <eos> Not this virgin little boy <eos> Little souls, blood in bowls and poured on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Thundering loud, I stand up proud as lightning crashed the waves <eos> I don't want to stay, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I pulled you in my body <eos> The thought is really odd I know <eos> Does it alarm you or disarm you? <eos> I should have warned you, I didn't mean to harm you so <eos> I only said I wanted <eos> To bring you near, you flaunted how <eos> You were a loner and a stone <eos> Who didn't know if you could be my home right now <eos> Little signs are beacons shining out on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer storm, bodies worn with shimmering lakes <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I'll bet your sadness shimmers <eos> I pressed my tongue against your hair <eos> You invite me, you say “delight me, and come inside me” <eos> But there's no room to hide me there <eos> Am I a tortured glutton? <eos> Am I some portion of a whole? <eos> On your horizon, always shining, the beacon brightest <eos> I take my hands off all controls <eos> Little souls can take no more, I'm torn from everyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer haze, all decaying, hand around a blade <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing love's remains <eos> 
Out on the water where you're gonna find me <eos> All alone with my mind headed for a bounty <eos> I've been living so long all by myself <eos> I can't think of living with anybody else <eos> I'm an oyster's pearl locked up in it's a shell <eos> You better bring that diving bell <eos> But I want you near <eos> I want to whisper to your ear <eos> I want to hold your hand <eos> I want to be your man <eos> Out on the river where you're gonna find me <eos> All alone with my thoughts headed for a bounty <eos> I've been living so long in a habitat <eos> Where the land's mighty rocky but the river stays flat <eos> Can you show me something, we can part with that <eos> But I want you near <eos> I want to whisper to your ear <eos> I want to hold your hand <eos> I want to be your man <eos> I'm gonna get you girl <eos> Like I got you <eos> Wrap you up in paper, bite you <eos> You're the pretty little thing that I gotta have <eos> Cause I want it <eos> 
Oh, never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop to think <eos> That I'd find myself here with you <eos> In your own world of dreams <eos> Oh, but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> Sometimes I stop and ask <eos> And wonder where you were <eos> Then I rip you from my mind <eos> Cause I thought you didn't care <eos> Oh but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> This time I know <eos> That my heart is true <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> I don't know why <eos> I had to play the game of losing you <eos> To make me see <eos> That I still love you <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> But here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oh no, oh no! <eos> Never never, ooh never baby <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> I just can't stop <eos> No, no, no <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oooh  <eos> 
Thinking about quitting <eos> Think it's time now <eos> Thinking it's all over <eos> Quiet in my mind <eos> Everybody's laughing <eos> Everybody's sure <eos> Nothing seems likely <eos> Nothing's unknown <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and <eos> You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Maybe I'm grieving <eos> Maybe I'm dead <eos> Maybe I'm leaving <eos> My heart's like lead <eos> Something feels missing <eos> Something ain't right <eos> Remember first kissing <eos> My heart felt wide <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and <eos> You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Oh, nothing last forever <eos> Oh, nothing suits me better <eos> Oh, I don't feel so clever <eos> But I'm tryin' to improve, oh-oh-oh <eos> So hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Yeah, everything's gonna be just fine <eos> So hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? (Yeah, yeah) <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and (Oh yeah) <eos> You know I always feel like the skies are falling (Oh-oh, yeah) <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> 
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm <eos> I got to tell you somethin' <eos> This phenomenon, I had to put it in a song <eos> And it goes like <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> You wanna know what brings me here, oh <eos> You glide through my head, blind to fear <eos> And I know why <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> You live too far away <eos> Your voice rings like a bell anyway <eos> Don't give up your independence <eos> Unless it feels so right <eos> Nothing good comes easily <eos> Sometimes you've got to fight <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy <eos> Still, it's fine from afar <eos> And you know that <eos> Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm <eos> Whoa, I got to tell you somethin' <eos>

Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
Horror, cataclysmic self-infliction <eos> Look upon the aftermath and cower in despair <eos> Your words have become a weapon <eos> Fabricating hell from heaven <eos> Your moral compass is but one of contradiction <eos> A snake can shed its skin but still remains a snake <eos> A blackened seed planted so carelessly <eos> The truth can be distorted but still remains the same <eos> Everything about this is wrong <eos> I found myself frantically searching <eos> For something that was never there <eos> With the rejection I was forced to react <eos> So I never looked back, I'm counting on that <eos> Your actions bring only dishonour <eos> Your cowardice nothing but shame <eos> The world in your hands, your head in the sand <eos> I bury your love with your name <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> Carry me away <eos> Into the endless night <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> Carry me away <eos> Onto a better life <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> Horror, spreading lies and defecation <eos> Your fragile wings were never meant to give you flight <eos> Abuse and degradation, far beyond imagination <eos> Now we've come undone, what have I become? <eos> I'm dangerous <eos> The very thing that stands to define a parasite <eos> Is its failure to survive without a host <eos> The very life you had but never really chose to see <eos> Is the thing your heart craves the most <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> Carry me away <eos> Into the endless night <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> Carry me away <eos> Onto a better life <eos> Obsidian tide <eos> 
I'm in Heaven <eos> Listen <eos> Pay attention, are you listening? <eos> You're my favorite girl <eos> Excuse me for the moment <eos> I'm in another world <eos> On a mountain, by a fountain <eos> Flowers blooming everywhere <eos> With Venus and with cupid <eos> The picture's very clear <eos> Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' <eos> Just a way to say that, I'm so into you <eos> And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove <eos> Erotic whispers for the listener <eos> Let the music fill the air <eos> Excuse me for a moment <eos> I'm at a loss for words <eos> By election, sheer perfection <eos> And as if these eyes would care <eos> Your heart is in the right place <eos> So don't you go and change <eos> Baby over and over <eos> The passion starts again <eos> You're my lollipops and everything <eos> And a little taste of sin <eos> Causing fire and desire <eos> In this mortal soul to live <eos> 'Til the angels fall from Heaven <eos> And the day the earth stands still <eos> Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' <eos> Just a way to say that, I'm so into you <eos> And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove <eos> When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove <eos> Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood <eos> Can you feel it? (Uh huh) <eos> Baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off <eos> This time, it's time for me and you <eos> Are you ready? (Yes) <eos> Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' <eos> Just a way to say that, I'm so into you <eos> And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove <eos> Close your eyes and let the music put you in the groove <eos> Lock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you <eos> Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' <eos>

Ay, así <eos> Oye, pa' gozar <eos> Dímelo, dímelo, dímelo <eos> Ah, jajaja <eos> Soy rara, te lo acepto <eos> Estoy loca, tengo mis defectos <eos> Pérdida, corro de abajo a arriba <eos> Aún no sé fijar la medida <eos> Lento voy retrocediendo, y cuento <eos> El tiempo que no vi siendo un ciego <eos> Olvide mi elemento, la voz, mi instrumento <eos> Lo que me da mi alimento <eos> Voy cayendo cada mañana <eos> Lo siento desde la madrugada <eos> En el campo esto es una batalla <eos> Pero no se me acaban las balas <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Soy positiva en mi presente <eos> Junto los cables, cruzo el puente <eos> Miro al frente, soy valiente <eos> Me hago consciente de mis poderes <eos> Sacudo con fuerza <eos> Mi cuerpo se extiende en la tierra <eos> Rezo por los hombres en guerra <eos> Por las mujeres que cuidan la siembra <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Oye, corazón es mi sitio <eos> Darte lo que yo pueda <eos> Eso es lo que más cuenta <eos> Oye, corazón es mi sitio <eos> Quitarme todos los vicios <eos> Sin tener juicios <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> Por un segundo mis piernas <eos> Reclaman el suelo que quema <eos> 
There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> As I look back over my shoulder <eos> All the stars are shining bright <eos> Just like the nights when I used to hold her <eos> She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon <eos> Lover's moon won't you shine on me <eos> I'm dancing with a memory <eos> Wish I may, I wish I might <eos> Have one last chance to hold her tight <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos> There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> Shining down on half of this world <eos> So many souls are in its light <eos> But for me there is just one girl <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos> 
I'm overcoming fear <eos> With Your perfect love, Your perfect love <eos> You're opening my ears to hear <eos> The sound of a lover's voice <eos> You're calling out, You're calling out <eos> Let me see Your face, Your loving face <eos> Your love tears me up <eos> And when it's done puts me together, ooh <eos> I'm overcoming fear <eos> With Your perfect love, Your perfect love <eos> You're opening my ears to hear <eos> The sound of a lover's voice <eos> You're calling out, You're calling out <eos> Let me see Your face, Your loving face <eos> Your love tears me up <eos> And when it's done puts me together <eos> Your love calls me out of my death and my failure <eos> Love, Your love <eos> Your love tears me up <eos> And when it's done puts me together <eos> Your love calls me out of my death and my failure <eos> Your love tears me up <eos> And when it's done puts me together <eos> Your love calls me out of my death and my failure <eos> Love, Your love, Your love <eos> 
I told Mary about us <eos> I told her about our great sin <eos> Mary cried and forgave me <eos> And Mary took me back again <eos> Said if I wanted my freedom <eos> I could be free evermore <eos> But I don't want to be, and I don't want to see <eos> Mary cry anymore <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Mary is waitin' and weepin' <eos> Down in our shack by the sea <eos> Even after I've hurt her <eos> Mary' still in love with me <eos> Devil woman it's over <eos> Trapped no more by your charms <eos> Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away <eos> Woman let go of my arm <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Devil woman you're evil <eos> Like the dark coral reef <eos> Like the winds that bring high tides <eos> You bring sorrow and grief <eos> You made me ashamed to face Mary <eos> Barely had the strength to tell <eos> Skies are not so black, Mary took me back <eos> Mary has broken your spell <eos> Oh, devil woman <eos> Devil woman, let go of me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I want to go home <eos> Runnin' along by the seashore <eos> Runnin' as fast as I can <eos> Even the seagulls are happy <eos> Glad I'm coming home again <eos> Never again will I ever <eos> Cause another tear to fall <eos> Down the beach I see, what belongs to me <eos> The one I want most of all <eos> Oh, devil woman, devil woman <eos> Don't follow me <eos> Devil woman, let me be <eos> And leave me alone <eos> I'm going back home <eos> 
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart <eos> But to movin' on is the hardest part <eos> It comes in waves, the letting go <eos> But the memory fades, everybody knows <eos> Everybody knows <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Maybe months go by, maybe years from now <eos> And I meet someone and it's workin' out <eos> Every now and then, he can see right through <eos> 'Cause when I look at him <eos> Yeah, all I  see is you <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> What if I never get over? <eos> What if I never get closure? <eos> What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya? <eos> What if It never gets better? <eos> What if this lasts forever and ever and ever? <eos> I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got? <eos> What if your love was my one and only shot? <eos> What if I end up with nothing to compare it to <eos> What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Oh, what if I never get over? <eos> Over you <eos> 
Hadn't had a good time <eos> Since you know when <eos> Got talked into going out <eos> With hopes you were staying in <eos> I was feeling like myself for the first time <eos> In a long time <eos> 'Til I bumped into some of your friends <eos> Over there talkin' to mine <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Knew it was gonna be a long night <eos> From the moment when <eos> We locked eyes over whiskey on ice <eos> Started talking 'bout us again <eos> If I would've just laid my drink down <eos> And walked out <eos> I wouldn't be in my truck <eos> Driving us to your house <eos> But you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart stormin’ <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> Yeah, you hit me Category 5 <eos> With your smile <eos> Blew me away <eos> And girl, it ain't but midnight <eos> You done killed the lights <eos> Bent my heart back to your bedside <eos> Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind <eos> Baby, without warning <eos> 'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight <eos> Had my heart storming <eos> The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’ <eos> Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning <eos> You wrecked my whole world when you came <eos> And hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> You hit me like a hurricane <eos> 
Too many birds in one tree <eos> Too many birds in one tree <eos> And the sky is full of black and screaming leaves <eos> The sky is full of black and screaming <eos> And one more bird <eos> Then one more bird <eos> And one last bird <eos> And another <eos> One last black bird without a place to land <eos> One last black bird without a place to be <eos> Turns around in hopes to find the place it last knew rest <eos> Oh black bird over black rain burn <eos> This is not where you last knew rest <eos> You fly all night to sleep on stone <eos> The heartless rest that in the morn will be gone <eos> You fly all night to sleep on stone <eos> To return to the tree with too many birds <eos> Too many birds <eos> Too many birds <eos> If <eos> If you <eos> If you could <eos> If you could only <eos> If you could only stop <eos> If you could only stop your <eos> If you could only stop your heart <eos> If you could only stop your heart beat <eos> If you could only stop your heart beat for <eos> If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart <eos> If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart beat <eos>

Love, love, love, why'd you take so long to come to me? Oh, baby <eos> Love love, your love, tell me where you hiding from me <eos> All the time <eos> Each time I try to find someone to take your place <eos> It was all in vain <eos> No, their lips were never quite the same, no, baby <eos> When I was kissing someone new, deep inside I was missing you <eos> Ah baby, you made me fall in love with you <eos> Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do <eos> Ah honey, I looked out into empty space <eos> And all I saw was your sweet face <eos> Love, love, love, you can't imagine what you did to me, oh baby <eos> And love, your love, every time you smile it goes through me <eos> All the time <eos> Day by day I'm fallin' more in love with you <eos> And that's no lie, cross my heart and honey I hope to die <eos> 'Cause I'm not tryin' to mislead you <eos> Believe me, girl, I really need you <eos> Oh, oh baby, you made me fall in love with you <eos> Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do <eos> Ah honey, I looked out into empty space <eos> All I saw was your sweet face <eos> Ah baby, you made me fall in love with you <eos> I don't know just what I'm gonna do <eos> Ah honey, I looked out into empty space <eos> All I saw was your sweet face <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> 
This town was built on miles of hope <eos> And I dare you to give me one reason to stay <eos> And maybe I won't go away <eos> So far you've only dared me once <eos> And I think we know that's not even close enough <eos> Not enough for me to stay <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Well I'm getting tired of standing around <eos> Just sitting here and waiting to be found <eos> Same old shit just a different day <eos> Well I'll wait around for one more day <eos> But I know that's what I will always say <eos> Will this ever be O.K.? <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> 
Venga el sabor <eos> El Ensamble, si señor <eos> Dicen tus jefes que a mi no me quieren <eos> Y yo me agüito y me salgo a beber <eos> Dicen que yo soy un gran mujeriego <eos> Y que te busco sólo pa' joder <eos> Joden y joden, no sé lo que quieren <eos> Si yo te amo y siempre te amaré <eos> Dicen tus jefes que yo soy un vago <eos> Que soy borracho y un loco también <eos> Pero no saben que yo a ti te amo <eos> Y que yo nunca te dejaré <eos> Porque eres tú mi amor, nada ni nadie nos va a separar <eos> Porque eres tú mi amor, nada ni nadie nos va a separar <eos> Ahí señor <eos> Dicen tus jefes que a mi no me quieren <eos> Y yo me agüito y me salgo a beber <eos> Dicen que yo soy un gran mujeriego <eos> Y que te busco sólo pa' joder <eos> Joden y joden, no sé lo que quieren <eos> Si yo te amo y siempre te amaré <eos> Dicen tus jefes que yo soy un vago <eos> Que soy borracho y un loco también <eos> Pero no saben que yo a ti te amo <eos> Y que yo nunca te dejaré <eos> Porque eres tú mi amor, nada ni nadie nos va a separar <eos> Porque eres tú mi amor, nada ni nadie nos va a separar <eos> 
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend <eos> And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when <eos> I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on <eos> But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone <eos> When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son <eos> Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns" <eos> But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die <eos> When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry <eos> I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car <eos> They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars <eos> Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free <eos> But those people keep a-movin' <eos> And that's what tortures me <eos> Well if they freed me from this prison <eos> If that railroad train was mine <eos> I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line <eos> Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay <eos> And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away <eos> 
She had a face straight out a magazine <eos> God only knows but you'll never leave her <eos> Her balaclava is starting to chafe <eos> And when she gets his gun, he's begging, "Babe, stay, stay, stay" <eos> "I'll give you one more time <eos> We'll give you one more fight <eos> Said one more line <eos> Will I know you?" <eos> Now if you never shoot, you'll never know <eos> And if you never eat, you'll never grow <eos> You've got a pretty kind of dirty face <eos> And when she's leaving your home she's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay <eos> "I'll give you one more time <eos> We'll give you one more fight <eos> Said one more line <eos> There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you" <eos> Well now that you've got your gun <eos> It's much harder now the police have come <eos> And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask <eos> But if you'd just take off your mask <eos> You'd find out everything's gone wrong <eos> Now everybody's dead <eos> And they're driving past my old school <eos> And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on <eos> She says, "Babe, you look so cool <eos> You look so cool, you look so cool <eos> You look so cool, you look so cool <eos> You look so cool" <eos> ('Cause I know you) <eos> (Side Fact) <eos> 
Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos> Si este amor fuera imposible <eos> Un deseo, un delirio intangible <eos> Viviría en la rutina de vivir <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si el amor no es el remedio <eos> Para que esta el corazón en el pecho <eos> Para que existen las rosas y el jardín <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos> 
A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos>

Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started doing the things you used to do <eos> As I was motorvatin' over the hill <eos> I saw Maybellene in a Coupe DeVille <eos> A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road <eos> Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford <eos> The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five <eos> She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You've started back doing the things you used to do <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> A Cadillac pulled up to one hundred and four <eos> The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more <eos> It done got a cloud and started to rain <eos> I tooted my horn for the passin' lane <eos> The rain water blowin' all under my hood <eos> I knew that was doin' my motor good <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos> The motor cooled down, the heat went down <eos> And that's when I heard that highway sound <eos> The Cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead <eos> A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead <eos> The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still <eos> And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill <eos> Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true? <eos> You done started back doing the things you used to do <eos>

In the bleak midwinter, frost winds made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow <eos> In the bleak midwinter, long ago <eos> Angels and archangels may have gathered there <eos> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air <eos> But his mother only, in her maiden bliss <eos> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss <eos> Hm <eos> Oh, what can I give him, poor as I am? <eos> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb <eos> If I were a wise man, I would do my part <eos> Yet what I can I give him <eos> I will give my heart <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> 
You're here where you should be <eos> Snow is falling as the carolers sing <eos> It just wasn't the same <eos> Alone on Christmas day <eos> Presents, what a beautiful sight <eos> Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight <eos> You're all that I need <eos> Underneath the tree <eos> Tonight, I'm gonna hold you close <eos> Make sure that you know <eos> I was lost before you <eos> Christmas was cold and grey <eos> Another holiday <eos> Alone to celebrate <eos> But then, one day, everything changed <eos> You're all I need <eos> Underneath the tree <eos> You're here where you should be <eos> Snow is falling as the carolers sing <eos> It just wasn't the same <eos> Alone on Christmas day <eos> Presents, what a beautiful sight <eos> Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight <eos> You're all that I need <eos> Underneath the tree <eos> I found what I was looking for <eos> A love that's meant for me <eos> A heart that's mine completely <eos> Knocked me right off my feet <eos> And this year I will fall <eos> With no worries at all <eos> 'Cause you are near and everything's clear <eos> You're all I need <eos> Underneath the tree <eos> You're here where you should be <eos> Snow is falling as the carolers sing <eos> It just wasn't the same <eos> Alone on Christmas day <eos> Presents, what a beautiful sight <eos> Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight <eos> You're all that I need <eos> Underneath the tree <eos> And then one day everything changed <eos> You're all I need <eos> Underneath the tree, yeah <eos> You're here where you should be <eos> Snow is falling as the carolers sing (Oh, yeah, yeah) <eos> It just wasn't the same (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Alone on Christmas day <eos> Presents, what a beautiful sight (Oh, you're all I need) <eos> Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight (Underneath the tree) <eos> You're all that I need (Underneath the tree, yeah) <eos> Underneath the tree, tonight <eos> Oh, you're all I need <eos> Underneath, underneath the tree <eos> 
All my life has been a surprise <eos> Faces cast in gold on the fire <eos> Phantoms colloquial and new <eos> Feelings inside floating through you <eos> All my life leads me to die <eos> Now Sherlock and Watson decide <eos> On a true mystery of the mind <eos> One Arthur Doyle would cease to write <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this time has been wasted to find <eos> The darkness triumphed over light <eos> Is the creator on my side? <eos> Or has he left us all behind? <eos> Oh, my love, I’m lost again <eos> Though I try, when will I win? <eos> You say life's not a race <eos> But if you're not around <eos> All this life has been a disguise <eos> Except for the hand in mine <eos> Belonging to my one true love <eos> In Santa Barbara on Hanukkah <eos> 
Letra de Fuego <eos> Hola, me inspiras cuando caminas <eos> Con tu mirada me devoras <eos> Tú sabes que me fascinas <eos> De esquina a esquina <eos> De abajo a arriba <eos> Con tu sabor a latina <eos> Se siente que no pasan las horas <eos> Me sacas de la rutina <eos> Mi vida es mejor ahora <eos> Quédate hasta el amanecer <eos> Yo que he esperado tanto <eos> Apágame <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemo' al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Nena, me inspiras cuando caminas <eos> Me pierdo en tus caderas <eos> Eres la cosa más linda <eos> De esquina a esquina <eos> De abajo a arriba <eos> Con tu sabor a latina <eos> Se siente que no pasan las horas <eos> Me sacas de la rutina <eos> Mi vida es mejor ahora <eos> Quédate hasta el amanecer <eos> Yo que he esperado tanto <eos> Apágame <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemo' al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Fuego, fuego (tu sonrisa, fuego que me mata) <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo (tu aceleras este sentimiento) <eos> Fuego, fuego (ven baila conmigo esta noche) <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo (ay yo me quemo, me quemo, quemo) <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemos al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos>

Well I chased her down the alley <eos> And over the hill to steal her will <eos> She was as hot as Georgia asphalt <eos> When the "A" crowd came to adore her brain <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> You should've seen her back in the city <eos> Poetry and jewels, broke all the rules <eos> She was as high as a Georgia pine tree <eos> Makeup and pills, overdue bills <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> Some sunny day when the hands of time <eos> Have had their way <eos> You'll understand why it was so hard to run away <eos> She's a loser she's a forgiver <eos> But she still finds good where no one could <eos> You ought to want her more than money <eos> Cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos>

I'm sittin' in the railway station <eos> Got a ticket for my destination, mmm <eos> On a tour of one night stands <eos> My suitcase and guitar in hand <eos> And every stop is neatly planned <eos> For a poet and a one man band <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Everyday's an endless stream <eos> Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm <eos> And each town looks the same to me <eos> The movies and the factories <eos> And every stranger's face I see <eos> Reminds me that I long to be <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Tonight I'll sing my songs again <eos> I'll play the game and pretend, mmm <eos> But all my words come back to me <eos> In shades of mediocrity <eos> Like emptiness in harmony <eos> I need someone to comfort me <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Silently for me <eos>

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree; <eos> And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud <eos> I can' t understand <eos> I get misty, just holding your hand <eos> Walk my way <eos> And a thousand violins begin to play <eos> Or it might be the sound of your hello <eos> That music I hear <eos> I get misty, the moment you're near <eos> You can say that you're leading me on <eos> But it's just what I want you to do <eos> Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost <eos> That's why I'm following you <eos> On my own <eos> Would I wander through this wonderland alone <eos> Never knowing my right foot from my left <eos> My hat from my glove <eos> I'm too misty, and too much in love <eos> I'm just too misty <eos> And too much <eos> In love..... <eos> 
Sweet emotion <eos> Sweet emotion <eos> Talk about things that nobody cares <eos> Wearing other things that nobody wears <eos> You're calling my name but I got to make clear <eos> I can't say baby where I'll be in a year <eos> Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent <eos> Said my get up and go, musta got up and went <eos> Well I got good news, she's a real good liar <eos> 'Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire <eos> Sweet emotion <eos> Sweet emotion <eos> I pulled into town in a police car <eos> Your daddy said I took it just a little too far <eos> You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied <eos> You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did <eos> You stand in the front just a shaking your ass <eos> I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass <eos> I'll talk about something you're sure to understand <eos> 'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand <eos> 
Mercy <eos> Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me? <eos> Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning? <eos> Mercy <eos> Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working? <eos> Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning? <eos> Cause it's still burning <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely <eos> Wind up home alone please don't call me <eos> And say you miss me, no <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Woah <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> If you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> If you're gonna take your shot, take it <eos> Take it <eos> Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Mmmh if you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Have mercy <eos> 
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To explain in due time all I know <eos> Time is a valuable thing <eos> Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <eos> Watch it count down to the end of the day <eos> The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal) <eos> Didn't look out below <eos> Watch the time go right out the window <eos> Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know <eos> I wasted it all just to watch you go <eos> I kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To remind myself how I tried so hard <eos> In spite of the way you were mockin' me <eos> Actin' like I was part of your property <eos> Rememberin' all the times you fought with me <eos> I'm surprised it got so far <eos> Things aren't the way they were before <eos> You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <eos> Not that you knew me back then <eos> But it all comes back to me in the end <eos> You kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> 
Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo giusto <eos> L tutti vivono in pace e onest <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Pien d'umanit in fondo all'anima <eos> Nella fantasia io vedo un mondo chiaro <eos> L anche la notte meno oscura <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Nella fantasia esiste un vento caldo <eos> Che soffia sulle citt, come amico <eos> Io sogno d'anime che sono sempre libere <eos> Come le nuvole che volano <eos> Pien d'umanit in fondo all'anima <eos>

Get out tonight <eos> From the deafening sound inside <eos> That I’ll deny <eos> But it feels like I’m right <eos> I’m feeling alright <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> Cut down to size <eos> Paralyzed <eos> Low tide <eos> Wait to rise <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> You lye, you lye, you lye <eos> Until you decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> Until you... <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> 
I want to take you everywhere I go <eos> Have you by my side <eos> Take a walk round in every town <eos> Drive across state lines <eos> Like the sun sends a golden stream <eos> In to our front room <eos> I could be the same old light <eos> For you <eos> Like the morning is always new <eos> I'll give it back to you <eos> Like the rain it just passes through <eos> For all you give <eos> I’ll give it back to you <eos> I think about it like a man in need <eos> Every time I'm gone <eos> Wait to see you like a mile long train is <eos> Passing by your door <eos> And my life is set around you now <eos> Tangled up the same <eos> And I will be <eos> The one who calls your name <eos> Like the night comes black and blue <eos> I'll give it back to you <eos> Like a road runs straight and true <eos> For all you give <eos> I’ll give it back to you <eos> 
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening <eos> In the lane snow is glistening <eos> A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Gone away is the bluebird <eos> Here to stay is a new bird <eos> He sings a love song as we go along <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> Then pretend that he is Parson Brown <eos> He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man" <eos> But you can do the job when you're in town <eos> Later on we'll conspire <eos> As we dream by the fire <eos> To face unafraid, the plans that we've made <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Over the ground lies the mantle of light <eos> A heaven of diamond in the lovely night <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> Then give him a name and call him Parson Brown <eos> He'll say, "Are you married?" And then we'll say, "No man" <eos> But now you can do the job whenever you're in town <eos> Later on we'll conspire <eos> As we dream sittin' by the fire <eos> To face unafraid all the plans that we've made <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Sleigh bells ring, are you listening <eos> In the lane snow is glistening <eos> A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight <eos> Walking in a winter wonderland <eos> Walking, walking in a winter wonderland <eos> 
Call it faith <eos> The moon it disappears, don't mean it's gone away <eos> All this space <eos> I'm afraid if I let go you'll float away <eos> I need a sign of grace, if there's a God above <eos> I know it's late, but wait up <eos> Call it faith <eos> The moon it disappears, don't mean it's gone away <eos> I wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos> I wanna drive this car <eos> Right <eos> Back to you <eos> I wanna burn out the engine <eos> I'm tired of pretending <eos> That it makes no difference <eos> And I'm fine with the ending <eos> I wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos> If it's all I do <eos> If it's all I do <eos> You were waiting <eos> Can only blame my youth and I can't understate it <eos> Can we redefine it? <eos> Oh, silver line it <eos> Realign <eos> Oh, dark to light <eos> I wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos> I wanna drive this car <eos> Right <eos> Back to you <eos> I wanna burn out the engine <eos> I'm tired of pretending <eos> That it makes no difference <eos> And I'm fine with the ending <eos> I wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos> If it's all do baby <eos> Oh, if it's all, all, all I do <eos> But I'm coming back to you darling <eos> Wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Oh, right with you <eos> I wanna drive this car <eos> Right <eos> Right back to you <eos> I wanna burn out the engine <eos> I'm tired of pretending <eos> That it makes no difference <eos> And I'm fine with the ending <eos> I wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos> Wanna get my heart <eos> Right <eos> Right with you <eos>

I’ve been told to be a seer, one must be ruthless <eos> So, I’ve eaten the yellow text of Paul and Brutus <eos> The soothsayers came and went, now I believe <eos> To be reborn, we first must cultivate a seed <eos> Oh, spit it out <eos> Release that precious piece <eos> Of pebbled ash from your mouth <eos> That’s a working-class jewel <eos> Spinning round your hopeless head <eos> It ain’t for chewing on <eos> It’s for looking through instead <eos> You prefer the common stone to the pearls <eos> Under the plexiglass with the factory girl <eos> Who told her sister all about you <eos> Hanging bedsheets on the clothesline in the sun <eos> She keep you warm, she keep you fed <eos> Now you’ve gone and lost your bed <eos> On the doorstep of the sick and indignant society <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who watched night disown day <eos> 35 days after defection <eos> I am sat in the cheapest of rooms <eos> There’s an oil lamp defiantly snapping at the shadows <eos> I’ve had notions to start playing chess <eos> But the mice, they have stolen the pieces <eos> I have told them to start paying rent or they must leave <eos> I am writing my letters <eos> I am anchored in an arm chair <eos> I intend on shooting the postman <eos> When he passes at dawn <eos> I haven’t eaten for 13 days <eos> I’ve taken the form of a Bosnian beggar <eos> And I’m reason the preachers are screaming and shouting <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who would love to be remembered <eos> By the ghosts of November <eos> On St. Stephens’s Day <eos> In some minuscule way <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> I can’t get out now <eos> So here’s a postcard from Catalonia <eos>

Uuuuh <eos> No <eos> No, no, no, no <eos> Yo no sé si tú, no sé si yo <eos> Seguiremos siendo como hoy <eos> No sé si después de amanecer <eos> Vamos a sentir la misma sed <eos> Para qué pensar y suponer <eos> No preguntes cosas que no sé, yo no sé <eos> No sé dónde vamos a parar <eos> Eso ya la piel nos lo dirá <eos> Para qué jurar y prometer algo que no está en nuestro poder <eos> Yo no sé lo que es eterno <eos> No me pidas algo que es del tiempo <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> De un cafe pasamos al sofá <eos> De un botón a todo lo demás <eos> No pusimos reglas ni reloj <eos> Aquí estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Todo lo que ves es lo que soy <eos> No me pidas más de lo que doy, no <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana quién va a estar aquí <eos> Esta vida es igual que un libro, cada pagina es un día vivido <eos> No tratemos de correr antes de andar <eos> Esta noches estamos vivos, solo este momento es realidad <eos> No, oh, no, no sé, oh <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Esta vida es una ruleta que gira sin parar <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Yo no sé si tú, yo no sé si yo, cómo será el final <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Puede ser peor, o puede ser mejor <eos> Yo no sé mañana <eos> Deja que el corazón decida, vida mía, lo que sentimos <eos> Mañana, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Ahora lo que vivimos es algo realmente lindo <eos> Quién puede saber lo que pasará mañana, no hay nada escrito <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé mañana <eos> Estamos solos tú y yo <eos> Y los momentos hay que vivirlos, hay que vivirlos <eos> ¡Oye! <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé, yo no sé <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos> Si estaremos juntos, si se acaba el mundo <eos> Yo no sé si soy para ti, si serás para mí <eos> Si lleguemos a amarnos o a odiarnos <eos> Yo no sé mañana, yo no sé mañana <eos>

Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train <eos> When I was feeling nearly faded as my jeans <eos> Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained <eos> And rode us all the way to New Orleans <eos> I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana <eos> I was playing soft while Bobby sung the blues, yeah <eos> Windshield wipers slapping time I was holding Bobby's hand in mine <eos> We sang every song that driver knew <eos> Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose <eos> Nothing, I mean nothing, honey if it isn't free, no no <eos> Yeah feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues <eos> You know feeling good was good enough for me <eos> Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee <eos> From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun <eos> Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul <eos> Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done <eos> Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold <eos> One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away <eos> He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it <eos> But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday <eos> To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine <eos> Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose <eos> Nothing, and that's all that Bobby left me <eos> Feeling good was easy Lord, when he sang the blues <eos> You know feeling good was good enough for me <eos> Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee <eos> La da la la la, la da la la la da la <eos> La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah <eos> La da la la la, la da la la la da la <eos> La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah <eos> La da la la la, la da la la la da la <eos> La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah <eos> La da la la la, la da la la la da la <eos> La da da la la la Bobby McGee yeah <eos> Lord, I called him my lover, I called him my man <eos> I said called him my lover just the best I can and come on <eos> And and a Bobby oh, and a Bobby McGee yeah <eos> Lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo <eos> Hey hey hey Bobby McGee, lord <eos> La da la la la, la da la la la la la <eos> Hey hey hey, Bobby McGee yeah <eos> 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me <eos> I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream) <eos> Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why <eos> Without you, it's hard to survive <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky <eos> They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry) <eos> The good and the bad times, we've been through them all <eos> You make me rise when I fall <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so?

I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 
Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> My baby beside me at the wheel <eos> I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile <eos> My curiosity runnin' wild <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> I's anxious to tell her the way I feel <eos> So I told her softly and sincere <eos> And she leaned and whispered in my ear <eos> Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> No particular place to go <eos> So we parked way out on the kokomo <eos> The night was young and the moon was bold <eos> So we both decided to take a stroll <eos> Can you imagine the way I felt? <eos> I couldn't unfasten her safety belt <eos> Ridin' along in my calaboose <eos> Still tryin' to get her belt aloose <eos> All the way home I held a grudge <eos> But the safety belt it wouldn't budge <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> 
I was born at the turn of the century <eos> Lucky to be born at all <eos> Grew up way down in Mississippi <eos> When I heard Robert Johnson call <eos> I’ve seen a lot and I've done a lot <eos> Too young to lay down in that hole <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos> Breaking rocks on a chain gang <eos> Up until the sun went down <eos> Too many souls are buried <eos> In the dirt poor delta ground <eos> I’ve seen a lot and I've done a lot <eos> Just too young to lay down in that hole <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos> I put lightning back in bottles <eos> Poke rattlesnakes just for fun <eos> People say I got an old soul <eos> And I ain’t even twenty-one <eos> But I’ve seen a lot and I done a lot <eos> Just ain’t ready for the hole, no I ain't <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> I’m just trying to fly high and not die <eos> Before I’m old <eos>

Hey younger me <eos> Made it harder than it had to be <eos> Trying hard to dodge my destiny <eos> But get the best of me <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> Way too young to pace the bedroom floor <eos> Always dreamed of kicking down the door <eos> What were you waiting for <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> Was as reckless as he should have been <eos> Close calls and down falls and getting back up again <eos> Doing it all again <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> Overthinking losing sleep at night <eos> Contemplating if it's worth the fight <eos> If he only knew he’d be all right <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> Youth ain't wasted on the young <eos> These trips around the sun <eos> I needed every one <eos> To get where I'm standing <eos> Now it’s an uphill road to run <eos> For my father's son <eos> Keep it together it won't be that way forever <eos> Younger me <eos> Hanging out but not quite fitting in <eos> Didn't know that being different <eos> Wouldn't really be the end <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> Youth ain't wasted on the young <eos> These trips around the sun <eos> I needed every one <eos> To get where I'm standing <eos> Now it's an uphill road to run <eos> For my father’s son <eos> Keep it together it won’t be that way forever <eos> Younger me <eos> You got me where I am today <eos> Got a few things right along the way <eos> You'll see just wait <eos> Yeah younger me <eos> 
Some folks are born made to wave the flag <eos> Ooh, they're red, white and blue <eos> And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief" <eos> Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no senator's son, son <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Some folks are born silver spoon in hand <eos> Lord, don't they help themselves, no <eos> But when the taxman come' to the door <eos> Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no millionaire's son, no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes <eos> Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord <eos> And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?" <eos> Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!" <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no military son, son, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, one <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate son, no no no <eos> 
She is lying yet <eos> That is meaningless and decay <eos> Lying and slight sway "Huge moth" <eos> 
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack frost nipping at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that santa's on his way - <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so i'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to ninety-two <eos> Although its been said many times <eos> Many ways: "merry christmas to you" <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> 
I've spent way too much time moving on <eos> Tried a couple of therapists <eos> Even got rid of some stuff <eos> It's like my mind got a mind of its own <eos> 'Cause I've been busy getting over <eos> Getting over someone <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like my skin isn't longing <eos> After the weight of your touch <eos> It's what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Someone left me with a broken heart <eos> That I passed on to someone <eos> And broke a new one apart <eos> Things can be good enough <eos> Still not enough <eos> And that's why I'm terrified <eos> Having you by my side <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like it ain't a habit <eos> Thinking 'bout "what if" too much <eos> Like what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> 
I, I hope she makes you smile <eos> The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone <eos> In the middle of a highway driving alone <eos> Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song <eos> That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her <eos> Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend <eos> Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him <eos> I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone <eos> And then she calls <eos> And baby, I, I hope you work it out <eos> Forgive and just about forget <eos> And take her on a first date again <eos> And when you lean in for a kiss <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> I hope what goes comes all the way around <eos> I hope she makes you feel the same way about her <eos> That I feel about you right now <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> Like you did on me <eos>

How do you capture the wind on the water? <eos> How do you count all the stars in the sky? <eos> How can you measure the love of a mother? <eos> Or how can you write down a baby's first cry? <eos> Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow <eos> Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn <eos> Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo <eos> Angels are singing; the Christ child is born <eos> Shepherds and wise men will kneel and adore him <eos> Seraphim round him their vigil will keep <eos> Nations proclaim him their Lord and their Saviour <eos> But Mary will hold him and sing him to sleep <eos> Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow <eos> Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn <eos> Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo <eos> Angels are singing; the Christ child is born <eos> Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger <eos> Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay <eos> Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation <eos> A child with his mother that first Christmas Day <eos> Candlelight, angel light, firelight and star-glow <eos> Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn <eos> Gloria! Gloria in excelsis deo <eos> Angels are singing; the Christ child is born <eos> 
Oh this perfume, must be something sacred <eos> To linger after you, like it do <eos> This scent's been buried where I rest my head <eos> Pretend to forget but it still feels like you <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Sleep much longer than I did before <eos> Though haunted are dreams evermore <eos> Bless these angels hanging over my head <eos> Still as a tomb though, I'm scared instead <eos> ('Cause) <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Oh you left so much behind <eos> I must be losing my mind, Oh <eos>

Te pienso con la madrugada <eos> Con la falta que me haces <eos> Haces de la nada todo <eos> Todo y luego me deshaces <eos> Pensar que la vida le daba y a mí solo me quitaba <eos> Si no estás tú no tengo nada <eos> Pensaba que tu amor sería donde a casa llegaría <eos> ¿Qué hago sin ti? Si eres mi vida <eos> Con las ganas que me abraces <eos> Con la falta que me haces <eos> Si Dios no se equivoca entonces dime cómo comprender <eos> Explícame si me soltaste o te solté <eos> ¿Qué nos pasó? ¿Fuiste o fui yo? <eos> Cuánto le debía al destino <eos> Cuánto que contigo se curó <eos> Pensaba que la vida daba y a mí sólo me quitaba <eos> Si no estás tú no tengo nada (Mmm-mmm) <eos> Pensaba que tu amor sería donde a casa llegaría <eos> ¿Qué hago sin ti? Si eres mi vida <eos> Con las ganas que me abraces <eos> Con la falta que me haces <eos> Con la falta que me haces <eos> 
Last night I, I saw you standing <eos> And I started, started pretending <eos> That I knew you, and you knew me too <eos> And just like a Roni, you were too shy <eos> But you weren't the only, 'cause so was I <eos> And I dreamed of you ever since <eos> Now I build up my confidence <eos> Girl next, next time you come my way <eos> I'll know just what to say... <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> I started to write you letters <eos> But I wanted to be more clever <eos> I wanted to get down and sweet talk you <eos> Hey, baby <eos> But just like a baby, I could not talk <eos> And I tried to come closer, but could not walk <eos> And I think of it every night <eos> How I just could not get it right! Oh! <eos> If we ever come close again <eos> I'll know what I'll say then, yeah <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Oh, girl... <eos> One more chance with you again <eos> I will not let it go! <eos> Oh, please! Give me just one more chance for love, love, love, love <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk? <eos> I wanna talk to my baby <eos> Come on and talk to me baby <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk? <eos> Come on and talk to me baby <eos> See I wanna know <eos> You better tell me your name baby <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> I wanna know, I wanna know <eos> I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> 
Je ne rêve plus, je ne fume plus, je n'ai même plus d'histoire <eos> Je suis sale sans toi, je suis laid sans toi <eos> Je suis comme un orphelin dans un dortoir <eos> Je n'ai plus envie de vivre ma vie, ma vie cesse quand tu pars <eos> Je n'ai plus de vie et même mon lit <eos> Se transforme en quai de gare quand tu t'en vas <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> T'arrives on ne sait jamais quand, tu r'pars on ne sait jamais où <eos> Et ça va faire bientôt deux ans que tu t'en fous <eos> Comme à un rocher, comme à un péché, je suis accroché à toi <eos> Je suis fatigué, je suis épuisé <eos> De faire semblant d'être heureux quand ils sont là <eos> Je bois toutes les nuits mais tous les whiskys, pour moi, ont le même goût <eos> Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau <eos> Je ne sais plus où aller, tu es partout <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Je verse mon sang dans ton corps <eos> Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi, tu dors <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Pourtant, moi, j'avais du talent avant ta peau <eos> Cet amour me tue, si ça continue, je crèverai seul avec moi <eos> Près de ma radio, comme un gosse idiot <eos> Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, c'est ça, je suis malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Et j'ai le cœur complètement malade <eos> Cerné de barricades, t'entends ? Je suis malade ! <eos> 
I've never given anyone a chance at my heart <eos> Momma always said it was a treasure to guard <eos> And the man whose worthy of given it to <eos> Will stick around long enough to prove it to you <eos> But now I'm the one whose losing my cool <eos> Butterflies make me feel like a fool <eos> I've always been the one in control <eos> But that boy just does something to my soul <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Around every bend and at the end he's right there waitin' for me <eos> He's chasin' me (Chasin' me) <eos> Oh, he's chasin' me (Chasin' me) <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos> He says I ain't getting away from him now <eos> I am the woman he's been dreaming about <eos> And he says, "It don't matter how long he has to wait <eos> He'll sleep outside my bedroom door in the pouring rain" <eos> And now I'm the one whose gonna give in <eos> I want his hands everywhere his eyes have been (His eyes have been) <eos> Don't think I'm trying to escape anymore <eos> 'Cause when I want I turn around to be sure <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me, (Chasin' me) <eos> Around every bend and at the end he's right there waiting for me <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Ah, he's chasin' me, (Chasin' me) <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Oh, he's catching up <eos> It might be love (It might be love) <eos> I'll guess we'll see <eos> I'll guess we'll see <eos> Oh, he's chasin' me, yeah <eos> Yeah, he's chasin' me, chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me, waiting for me <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos>

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> Take a look at the five and ten <eos> It's glistening once again <eos> With candy canes and silver lanes aglow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots <eos> Is the wish of Barney and Ben; <eos> Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk <eos> Is the hope of Janice and Jen; <eos> And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well <eos> It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; <eos> Soon the bells will start <eos> And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing <eos> Right within your heart <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> Sure it's Christmas once more <eos> 
I was just a wandering soul <eos> Working through the highs and lows <eos> I heard a spirit whisper slow <eos> Drift into a great unknown <eos> Will anybody see my ghost? <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I began to hear my name <eos> And silence in a hurricane <eos> The dust was leaving from my veins <eos> Like some forgotten border train <eos> Carried to my home again <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I wade in darkness <eos> But I can feel you calling, hear you calling <eos> As I shut my wanting eyes <eos> I said I'd love you 'till I die <eos> Ah <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> 
Ah, ah, ah <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Ah, ah, ah <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> If you need me, call me <eos> No matter where you are <eos> No matter how far <eos> Just call my name <eos> I'll be there in a hurry <eos> On that you can depend and never worry <eos> You see, my love is alive <eos> It's like a seed that only needs <eos> The thought of you to grow <eos> So if you feel the need for company <eos> Please, my darling <eos> Let it be me <eos> Ah, ah, ah <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> I may not be able to express <eos> The depth of the love I feel for you <eos> But a writer put it very nicely <eos> When he was away from the one he loved <eos> He sat down and wrote these words <eos> (No wind) No wind <eos> (No rain) No rain <eos> (Or winter's cold Can stop me baby) Ooh baby <eos> (Baby) Baby <eos> (If you're my goal) Oh <eos> (No wind) No wind <eos> (No rain) No rain <eos> (Can stop me baby) If you are my goal <eos> Ah, ah, ah <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> I know, I know you must follow the sun <eos> Where ever it leads <eos> But remember, if you should fall short of your desires <eos> Remember life's holds to you one guarantee <eos> You'll always have me <eos> And if you should miss my lovin' <eos> One of these old days <eos> If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close <eos> Or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly <eos> Just remember what I told you the day I set you free <eos> (Ain't no mountain high enough) Oh <eos> (Ain't no valley low enough) Ooh <eos> (Ain't no river wide enough) Ooh <eos> To keep me from you <eos> (Ain't no mountain high enough) Ow <eos> (Ain't no valley low enough) Say it again <eos> (Ain't no river wide enough) Hey <eos> To keep me from you <eos> Ain't no mountain high enough <eos> Nothing can keep me, keep me from you <eos> Ain't no mountain high enough (no) <eos> Nothing can keep me, keep me from you <eos> Ain't no mountain high enough (oh) <eos> Ain't no valley low enough (say it again) <eos> Ain't no river wide enough (yeah yeah) <eos> To keep me from you <eos> Ain't no mountain high enough <eos> (Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough) <eos> Nothing can keep me, keep me from you <eos> (Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you) <eos> Nothing in this world <eos> (Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley low enough) <eos> Nothing in this world to keep me from you <eos> (Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you) <eos>

Rosas sobre el mantel <eos> Que no te dicen nada <eos> Y yo derramando miel <eos> Y tú me das la espalda <eos> ¿Y si te olvido? <eos> No estoy en posición pa’ decidirlo <eos> Pero tanto te he callado que me mata <eos> Que me mata <eos> Que me mata <eos> ¿Pero cómo te digo? <eos> (¿Cómo yo te digo?) <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> Rosas siempre a tus pies <eos> Pisadas <eos> Te lloro un río en el cóctel <eos> (Martini extra wet) <eos> Tal vez cuando pasen más de diez años <eos> Y no lo pienses demasiado <eos> Te des cuenta quién estuvo a tu lado <eos> ¿Pero cómo te digo? <eos> (¿Cómo yo te digo?) <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> 
In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos>

In the twilight glow I see them <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> When we kissed goodbye and parted <eos> I knew we'd never meet again <eos> Love is like a dying ember <eos> And only memories remain <eos> And through the ages I'll remember <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> Some day when we meet up yonder <eos> We'll stroll hand-in-hand again <eos> In a land that knows no parting <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> Now my hair has turned to silver <eos> All my life I've loved in vain <eos> I can see her star in heaven <eos> Blue eyes crying in the rain <eos> 
Duele dejarlo así <eos> No fue lo que pedimos <eos> Duele pensarnos y no <eos> Vernos aquí <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? Ohh <eos> Duele dejarlo ir <eos> Todo lo que vivimos <eos> Como verlo en un libro <eos> Un diario del ayer <eos> Ahhh <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> Duеle pensarlo así <eos> No puedo digеrirlo, amor <eos> Fue lo que no dijimos <eos> Lo que quedó por dar. Ahh <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> Baby ven y dime que no es cierto <eos> Baby yo, te lo juro que no entiendo <eos> Baby ven y dime que no es cierto <eos> Baby yo, baby yo <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> No es cierto <eos>

Remember when Hell had frozen over? <eos> The cold still burns underneath my skin <eos> The water is rising all around me <eos> And there is nothing left I can give <eos> All these tears I've shed <eos> I saw the wildfire spread <eos> You said you cheated death <eos> But Heaven was in my head <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> The embers still glow when I'm sober <eos> The gold in the flame burns brighter now <eos> I have to rebuild, now it's over <eos> Maybe now I'm lost, I can live <eos> Souls don't break, they bend <eos> But I sometimes forget <eos> I have to do this for you <eos> And the only way out is through <eos> Yeah, death is an open door <eos> Words the prophets said <eos> Still swimming through my head <eos> Now there's no stars left in the sky <eos> 'Cause this well will never run dry <eos> What if I completely forget? <eos> What if I never accept? <eos> 'Cause when you fade away <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> Yeah <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> 
The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly <eos> The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly <eos> Then you and I came wandering by <eos> And lost in a sigh were we <eos> The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly <eos> I can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly <eos> Your arms opened wide and closed me inside <eos> You took my lips, you took my love so tenderly <eos> 
When I wake up in the morning, love <eos> And the sunlight hurts my eyes <eos> And something without warning, love <eos> Bears heavy on my mind <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> When the day that lies ahead of me <eos> Seems impossible to face <eos> When someone else instead of me <eos> Always seems to know the way <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> When the day that lies ahead of me <eos> Seems impossible to face <eos> When someone else instead of me <eos> Always seems to know the way <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day) <eos>

What would you say if you could say <eos> Everything you needed to <eos> To the one, you needed to? <eos> You flash like a setting sun <eos> You come around, I come undone <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> Just yesterday north of LA <eos> I couldn't help but think of you <eos> Every time I think of you <eos> You crash like a rolling wave <eos> You come around I lose my brain <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> (And you, and you, and you) <eos> I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go <eos> There are only twenty <eos> Six letters I can use <eos> Just to tell you I won't let go <eos> Don't you let go <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> (I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go) <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos>

I'm a puppet on a string <eos> Tracy Island, time-traveling <eos> Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches <eos> Come to find you four in some velvet morning <eos> Years too late, she's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? Woah, ah <eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end <eos> Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes <eos> Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days <eos> Great escape, lost track of time and space <eos> She's a silver lining climbing on my desire <eos> And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?) <eos> And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways <eos> So in case, I'm mistaken, I <eos> Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby <eos> Are you mine?" <eos> She's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> 
When you saw your dad shoot up for the first time <eos> It must've came as quite a shock <eos> You sat numb in your room for hours <eos> Ignoring the afternoon's drop-offs <eos> You picture him, arms outstretched in a song <eos> After Sunday school let out <eos> He'd drive the family home and you'd <eos> Talk about Jesus <eos> But fifteen years can change a man <eos> Alone in this wilderness <eos> Say "keep your head up" if you're not okay <eos> But not okay is what's expected <eos> They claim you're a hero if you can make it off the couch <eos> You know the truth in what they say <eos> The world's gonna kick you either way <eos> But now you're stuck in this routine <eos> Just trying to make something on your own <eos> Your older brother fled the country <eos> The cops are coming 'round your home <eos> But Kaylee has a baby on the way <eos> They're not gonna leave her a single mother <eos> The dope was legal but they roughed you up <eos> For selling on the side <eos> Yeah, twenty years will change a man <eos> Ten with behavior is what you're looking at <eos> Just keep your head down and you'll be okay <eos> You're living up to what's expected <eos> They'll claim you're nothing when you're walking out the door <eos> You know the truth in what they say <eos> The world's gonna kick you either way <eos> And Mom won't even come around most days <eos> You pop your prescription and you put on a brave face <eos> Zone out to the local AM station <eos> And try not to think about next month's visitation <eos> I saw you last week, we haven't talked since graduation <eos> You're moving "H" with a guy to catch up, but it's clear you're using <eos> I didn't have the guts to be a better friend <eos> But what's another ten grand gonna fix in the end? <eos> Say "keep your head up" if you're not okay <eos> But not okay is what's expected <eos> They claim you're a hero, but you died there on the couch <eos> You know the truth in what they say <eos> The world's gonna kick you either way <eos> 
Just a small-town girl <eos> Livin' in a lonely world <eos> She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> Just a city boy <eos> Born and raised in South Detroit <eos> He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> A singer in a smoky room <eos> The smell of wine and cheap perfume <eos> For a smile, they can share the night <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Workin' hard to get my fill <eos> Everybody wants a thrill <eos> Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time <eos> Some will win, some will lose <eos> Some are born to sing the blues <eos> Oh, the movie never ends <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> 
Well, it's Sunday morning <eos> And the sun in shining in my eye that is open <eos> And my head is spinning <eos> Was the life of the party <eos> I can't stop grinning <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Now wait a minute <eos> Things don't look to familiar <eos> Who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me? <eos> He's awful cute <eos> But how'd I get his shirt on? <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> All those little shooters <eos> How I love to drink 'em down <eos> Come on, bartender <eos> Let's have another round <eos> Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high <eos> Tomorrow might be painful <eos> But tonight we're gonna fly <eos> Did I start any fights? <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Every time we get together <eos> I sure have a good time <eos> You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo <eos> (Tequila) <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine <eos> 
On the way I was crowned a king <eos> Felt the wind underneath my wings <eos> I've been high and I've been low <eos> Played the fool and the star of the show <eos> Gone along for a wild ride <eos> And I can say lookin' in your eyes <eos> That it all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found cynicism, I found criticism <eos> I've been the zero, the hero <eos> And I have been the villain <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> On the way I was given the keys <eos> To the city they were mine to keep <eos> Over time every lock'll change <eos> But you love me all the same <eos> I found pessimism, I found skepticism <eos> I've been the corner performer and sung in front of millions <eos> I lost more than a heart can take <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would've been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> I found you on the way <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> I found you, I found you <eos> It all would have been a waste <eos> But I found you on the way <eos> 
You tell me you're in love with me <eos> Like you can't take your pretty eyes away from me <eos> It's not that I don't wanna stay <eos> But every time you come too close, I move away <eos> I wanna believe in everything that you say <eos> 'Cause it sounds so good <eos> But if you really want me, move slow <eos> There's things about me you just have to know <eos> Sometimes I run, sometimes I hide <eos> Sometimes I'm scared of you <eos> But all I really want is to hold you tight <eos> Treat you right, be with you day and night <eos> Baby, all I need is time <eos> I don't wanna be so shy, oh, oh <eos> Every time that I'm alone, I wonder why <eos> Hope that you will wait for me <eos> You'll see that you're the only one for me <eos> I wanna believe in everything that you say <eos> 'Cause it sounds so good <eos> But if you really want me, move slow <eos> There's things about me you just have to know <eos> Sometimes I run (Sometimes), sometimes I hide <eos> Sometimes I'm scared of you <eos> But all I really want is to hold you tight <eos> Treat you right, be with you day and night <eos> All I really want is to hold you tight <eos> Treat you right, be with you day and night <eos> Baby, all I need is time <eos> Just hang around and you'll see <eos> There's nowhere I'd rather be <eos> If you love me, trust in me <eos> The way that I trust in you <eos> Ah, ooh, yeah <eos> Sometimes I run (Sometimes), sometimes I hide <eos> Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, ooh) <eos> But all I really want is to hold you tight (Hold you tight) <eos> Treat you right, be with you day and night (Day and night) <eos> (Ooh, yeah) <eos> Sometimes I run (Sometimes), sometimes I hide <eos> Sometimes I'm scared of you (Ooh, ooh) <eos> But all I really want is to hold you tight <eos> I'll treat you right, I'll be with you day and night (Day and night) <eos> All I really want is to hold you tight <eos> Be with you day and night <eos> Sometimes I run (Sometimes), sometimes I hide <eos> Sometimes I'm scared of you <eos> But all I really want is to hold you tight <eos> Treat you right, be with you day and night <eos> 
There are people in town, man, crazy people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee cola <eos> They believe we are wild, man, they believe we are wild <eos> Just because we don't use any money, and we drink no coffee cola <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> There are people in town, man, weird people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee and cola <eos> Money is what they like most, money is what they like <eos> And people who have plenty of money belong to high society <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> I was told that is to get the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> That is where they can find the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> 
Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Esto que siento me supera y no lo aguanto <eos> Sin ti los días pasan sin su encanto <eos> No tengo nada en mi defensa, sabes que no soy un santo <eos> Pero si me lo preguntas, quizá no era para tanto <eos> Yo dando potes <eos> Gritando tu nombre con fuerza pa' que lo notes <eos> Camino donde caminas esperando que te topes <eos> Soñando que me llamas y voy a todo galope <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la nochе ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienеs, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la noche ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienes, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Te quise más de lo que tú me quisiste <eos> Inestable desde que te fuiste y muy triste <eos> Mi consciencia dice: "¿Acaso enloqueciste?" <eos> Y yo no sé qué decirle, me tiembla la voz <eos> Ya no veo tu luz <eos> Ahora estás lejos, ya no hay plenitud <eos> ¿Ahora cómo le haré pa' agarrar altitud? <eos> Me haces falta, no hay como tú, auh <eos> Me acostumbré a no estar solo, uh, uh <eos> Ando ansioso y no lo controlo, uh-uh-uh, uh <eos> Estoy consciente de toda la razón que había en la gente <eos> Te doy tu despedida, mi amor, un beso en la frente <eos> Lo mío por ti seguirá latente <eos> Detente, permíteme mirarte bien, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> 
The awakened pulse of a blackened star <eos> The dawn of nightfall <eos> The bright unlight shine wide and far <eos> Enchant, enthrall, shatter my fears <eos> The broken glass of a thousand spheres <eos> Pierce the clouds to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> Death, as the fire within is released <eos> The infernal depths of eternity whispering beyond <eos> I hear the serpent’s whispering respond <eos> The strangler and the wide awake <eos> The vision and the twisting snake <eos> Connect the worlds to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> I call on thee, demon god with crimson scales adorned <eos> I call on thee of sacred blood, take my soul beyond <eos> Now answer me, serpent king, deity of the night <eos> Now answer me, fiery wing, save me from the light <eos> Hail the dead <eos> Hail the dark <eos> Hail the night <eos> Hail the silence <eos> The stormy winds of eternity <eos> Haunting life’s debris <eos> And fools set sails to flee the void on the raging sea <eos> Drag me down underneath, unchain my soul beneath <eos> Fill my lungs with your blood to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> I call on thee, demon god with crimson scales adorned <eos> I call on thee of sacred blood, take my soul beyond <eos> Now answer me, serpent king, deity of the night <eos> Now answer me, fiery wing, save me from the light <eos> Hail the dead <eos> Hail the dark <eos> Hail the night <eos> Hail the silence <eos> 
Light reflects from your shadow <eos> It is more than I thought could exist <eos> You move through the room <eos> Like breathing was easy <eos> If someone believed me <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> In love, love, love <eos> And everyday <eos> I am learning about you <eos> The things that no one else sees <eos> And the end comes too soon <eos> Like dreaming of angels <eos> And leaving without them <eos> And leaving without them <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> And with words unspoken <eos> A silent devotion <eos> I know you know what I mean <eos> And the end is unknown <eos> But I think I'm ready <eos> As long as you're with me <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos>

Gone a little far <eos> Gone a little far this time with something <eos> How was I to know? <eos> How was I to know this high came rushing? <eos> We're on the borderline <eos> Dangerously fine and unforgiven <eos> Possibly a sign <eos> I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday <eos> Here I go <eos> Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​ <eos> I wonder how I managed to end up in this place <eos> Where I couldn't get away <eos> We're on the borderline (Ooh) <eos> Caught between the tides of pain and rapture <eos> Then I saw the time <eos> Watched it speedin' by like a train <eos> Like a train <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Little closer, close enough <eos> I'm a loser, loosen up <eos> Setting free, must be tough <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be so in love? <eos> Any closer? Close enough <eos> Shout out to what is done <eos> R.I.P., here comes the sun <eos> (Comes the sun) <eos> Gone a little far <eos> Gone a little far this time with something <eos> Rudy said it's fine <eos> They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable) <eos> And we're on the borderline (Ooh) <eos> Caught between the tides of pain and rapture <eos> Then I saw the time <eos> Watched it speedin' by like a train <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Little closer, close enough <eos> I'm a loser, loosen up <eos> Setting free, must be tough <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be so in love? <eos> Any closer? Close enough <eos> Shout out to what is done <eos> R.I.P., here comes the sun <eos> (Comes the sun) <eos>
