Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos> 
I need love, love <eos> To ease my mind <eos> I need to find, find <eos> Someone to call mine <eos> But mama said <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said love don't come easy <eos> It's a game of give and take <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> You got to trust, give it time <eos> No matter how long it takes <eos> But how many heartaches must I stand <eos> Before I find a love <eos> To let me live again <eos> Right now the only thing <eos> That keeps me hangin' on <eos> When I feel my strength <eos> Yeah, it's almost gone <eos> I remember mama said <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said love don't come easy <eos> It's a game of give and take <eos> How long must I wait <eos> How much more can I take <eos> Before loneliness <eos> Will cause my heart, heart to break? <eos> No I can't bear <eos> To live my life alone <eos> I grow impatient for a love <eos> To call my own <eos> But when I feel that I <eos> I can't go on <eos> These precious words keeps me hangin' on <eos> I remember mama said <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said love don't come easy <eos> It's a game of give and take <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said trust, give it time <eos> No matter how long it takes <eos> (Now wait) <eos> No, love, love <eos> Don't come easy <eos> But I keep on waiting <eos> Anticipating <eos> For that soft voice <eos> To talk to me at night <eos> For some tender arms <eos> To hold me tight <eos> I keep waiting <eos> I keep on waiting (Ooh, until that day) <eos> But it ain't easy <eos> It ain't easy <eos> But mama said <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said trust, give it time <eos> No matter how long it takes <eos> You can't hurry love <eos> No, you just have to wait <eos> She said love don't come easy <eos> It's a game of give and take <eos> (repeat and fade) <eos> 
Silent night <eos> Holy night <eos> All is calm <eos> All is bright <eos> Round yon virgin <eos> Mother and child <eos> Holy Infant <eos> So tender and mild <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> 
Oh, If you're gonna get too stoned <eos> And you can't you see <eos> I can't think straight <eos> When you're looking at me <eos> 'Cause you got those eyes <eos> You're gonna be mine tonight <eos> Oh, you’re gonna get stoned <eos> Well, that is alright <eos> But don't throw it away <eos> 'Cause in the morning I'll be gone <eos> And it really don't last that long <eos> And I know it seems <eos> That there's faces out on the street to beat <eos> But If you throw it away <eos> You'll be on your own <eos> Oh, the time has come to <eos> Throw some stones at me <eos> And you'll make it <eos> So I can't be <eos> 'Cause you got your ways <eos> Oh, you're gonna get made tonight <eos> But if you're gonna get stoned <eos> Well, that is alright, yeah <eos> But don't throw it away <eos> 'Cause in the morning I'll be gone <eos> And it really don't last that long <eos> And I know it seems <eos> That there's faces out on the street to beat <eos> But If you throw it away <eos> You'll be on your own <eos> Oh <eos> Yeah <eos> Oh, you're on your own <eos> (Ah ha) Yeah, you're on your own <eos> (Ah ha) Yeah, you're on your own <eos> (Ah ha) Well, you're on your own <eos> (Ah ha) Yeah, you're on your own <eos> (Ah ha) You're on your own <eos> You're on your own <eos> 
I am walking <eos> Out in the rain <eos> And I am listening to the low moan <eos> Of the dial tone again <eos> And I am getting <eos> Nowhere with you <eos> And I can't let it go <eos> And I can't get through... <eos> The old woman behind the pink curtains <eos> And the closed door <eos> On the first floor <eos> She's listening through the air shaft <eos> To see how long our swan song can last <eos> And both hands <eos> Now use both hands <eos> Oh, no don't close your eyes <eos> I am writing <eos> Graffiti on your body <eos> I am drawing the story of <eos> How hard we tried <eos> I am watching your chest rise and fall <eos> Like the tides of my life <eos> And the rest of it all <eos> And your bones have been my bedframe <eos> And your flesh has been my pillow <eos> I am waiting for sleep <eos> To offer up the deed <eos> With both hands <eos> In each other's shadows we grew less and less tall <eos> And eventually our theories couldn't explain it all <eos> And i'm recording our history now on the bedroom wall <eos> And when we leave the landlord will come <eos> And paint over it all <eos> And I am walking <eos> Out in the rain <eos> And I am listening to the low moan of the dial tone again <eos> And I am getting nowhere with you <eos> And I can't let it go <eos> And I can't get through <eos> So now use both hands <eos> Please use both hands <eos> Oh, no don't close your eyes <eos> I am writing graffiti on your body <eos> I am drawing the story of how hard we tried <eos> Hard we tried <eos> How hard we tried <eos> 
Elle avait des bagues à chaque doigt <eos> Des tas de bracelets autour des poignets <eos> Et puis elle chantait avec une voix <eos> Qui, sitôt, m'enjôla <eos> Elle avait des yeux, des yeux d'opale <eos> Qui m'fascinaient, qui m'fascinaient <eos> Y avait l'ovale de son visage pâle <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> De femme fatale qui m'fut fatal <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus d'vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est réchauffés <eos> Puis on s'est séparés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir, aïe, aïe, aïe! <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Ça fait déjà un fameux bail <eos> Au son des banjos je l'ai reconnu <eos> Ce curieux sourire qui m'avait tant plu <eos> Sa voix si fatale, son beau visage pâle <eos> M'émurent plus que jamais <eos> Je me suis soûlé en l'écoutant <eos> L'alcool fait oublier le temps <eos> Je me suis réveillé en sentant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> Des baisers sur mon front brûlant <eos> On s'est connus, on s'est reconnus <eos> On s'est perdus de vue, on s'est r'perdus de vue <eos> On s'est retrouvés, on s'est séparés <eos> Puis on s'est réchauffés <eos> Chacun pour soi est reparti <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> Je l'ai revue un soir ah là là <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Elle est retombée dans mes bras <eos> Quand on s'est connus <eos> Quand on s'est reconnus <eos> Pourquoi s'perdre de vue <eos> Se reperdre de vue? <eos> Quand on s'est retrouvés <eos> Quand on s'est réchauffés <eos> Pourquoi se séparer? <eos> Alors tous deux, on est repartis <eos> Dans l'tourbillon de la vie <eos> On a continué à tourner <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> Tous les deux enlacés <eos> 
There I was completely wasting, out of work and down <eos> All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town <eos> Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die <eos> So I might as well begin to put some action in my life <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> So much for the golden future, I can't even start <eos> I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart <eos> You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue <eos> If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> You don't know what it's like <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> 
It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> With the kids jingle belling <eos> And everyone telling you "be of good cheer" <eos> It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> It's the hap-happiest season of all <eos> With those holiday greetings <eos> And gay happy meetings when friends come to call <eos> It's the hap-happiest season of all <eos> There'll be parties for hosting <eos> Marshmallows for toasting <eos> And caroling out in the snow <eos> There'll be scary ghost stories <eos> And tales of the glories <eos> Of Christmases long, long ago <eos> It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> There'll be much mistletoeing <eos> And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near <eos> It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> There'll be parties for hosting <eos> Marshmallows for toasting <eos> And caroling out in the snow <eos> There'll be scary ghost stories <eos> And tales of the glories <eos> Of Christmases long, long ago <eos> It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> There'll be much mistletoeing <eos> And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near <eos> It's the most wonderful time <eos> It's the most wonderful time <eos> It's the most wonderful time <eos> It's the most wonderful time of the year <eos> 
No New Year's Day to celebrate <eos> No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away <eos> No first of Spring, no song to sing <eos> In fact here's just another ordinary day <eos> No April rain, no flowers bloom <eos> No wedding Saturday, within the month of June <eos> But what it is, is something true <eos> Made up of these three words that I must say to you <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> I just called to say how much I care <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> And I mean it from the bottom of my heart <eos> No summer's high <eos> No warm July <eos> No harvest moon to light one tender August night <eos> No autumn breeze <eos> No falling leaves <eos> Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies <eos> No Libra sun <eos> No Halloween <eos> No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring <eos> But what it is, though old so new <eos> To fill your heart like no three words could ever do <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> I just called to say how much I care <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> And I mean it from the bottom of my heart <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> I just called to say how much I care <eos> I just called to say I love you <eos> And I mean it from the bottom of my heart <eos> Of my heart <eos> Of my heart <eos> 
Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> S'envole une chanson <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Elle est née d'aujourd'hui <eos> Dans le cœur d'un garçon <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Marchent des amoureux <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Leur bonheur se construit <eos> Sur un air fait pour eux <eos> Sous le pont de Bercy <eos> Un philosophe assis <eos> Deux musiciens quelques badauds <eos> Puis les gens par milliers <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Jusqu'au soir vont chanter <eos> Hum Hum <eos> L'hymne d'un peuple épris <eos> De sa vieille cité <eos> Près de Notre Dame <eos> Parfois couve un drame <eos> Oui mais à Paname <eos> Tout peut s'arriver <eos> Quelques rayons <eos> Du ciel d'été <eos> L'accordéon <eos> D'un marinier <eos> L'espoir fleurit <eos> Au ciel de Paris <eos> Et le ciel de Paris <eos> A son secret pour lui <eos> Depuis vingt siècles il est épris <eos> De notre Île Saint Louis <eos> Quand elle lui sourit <eos> Il met son habit bleu <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Quand il pleut sur Paris <eos> C'est qu'il est malheureux <eos> Quand il est trop jaloux <eos> De ses millions d'amants <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Il fait gronder sur nous <eos> Son tonnerr' éclatant <eos> Mais le ciel de Paris <eos> N'est pas longtemps cruel <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Pour se fair' pardonner <eos> Il offre un arc en ciel <eos> 
Ô la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Hum la belle vie <eos> On est seul <eos> On est libre <eos> Et l'on s'aime <eos> On s'amuse à passer avec tous ses copains <eos> Des nuits blanches <eos> Qui se penchent <eos> Sur les petits matins <eos> Mais la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Oui la belle vie <eos> On s'enlace <eos> On est triste <eos> Et l'on traîne <eos> Alors pense que moi je t'aime <eos> Et quand tu auras compris <eos> Réveille-toi <eos> Je serai là <eos> Pour toi <eos> 
Sittin' on my own, chewin' on a bone <eos> A thousand million miles from home <eos> When something hit me <eos> Somewhere right between the eyes <eos> Sleepin' on a plane, you know you can't complain <eos> You took your last chance once again <eos> I landed, stranded <eos> Hardly even knew your name <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> Until the morning light <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life <eos> You and me see how we are <eos> You and me see how we are <eos> All your dreams are made of strawberry lemonade <eos> And you make sure I eat today <eos> You take me walking <eos> To where you played when you were young <eos> I'll never say that I won't ever make you cry <eos> And this I'll say, I don't know why <eos> I know I'm leavin' <eos> But I'll be back another day <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> Until the morning light <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (You saved my life) <eos> I wanna talk tonight (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> 'Bout how you saved my life (I wanna talk tonight) <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> I wanna talk tonight <eos> 
Five hundred years has gone since I summoned thee, I learnt all thy lore and made everyone worship me <eos> The Picatrix of Dee, which thou didst give to me, made me grow tentacles and helped me conquer eternity <eos> The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise, bring about your glory and our imminent demise <eos> The Black Keyes of yore rising from the sea, give me true power as promised by Johnny Dee! <eos> Now thou art dead, yet I live forevermore. I became the shoggoth-master and Deep Ones hold me in awe <eos> 'Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest', Paracelsus stands by my side because I resurrected him <eos> The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise, bring about your glory and our imminent demise <eos> The Black Keyes of yore rising from the sea, give me true power as promised by Johnny Dee! <eos> 'O spiritus Itnaal et Cthulhu! Accipite sacrificium ut nihil contra me et contra clavem nigrem valeat sera ubi ista clavis ponetur.' <eos> The Black Keyes of R'lyeh and Cthulhu arise! <eos> 'Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest' <eos> 
Letra de "Dígale" <eos> No ha podido olvidar mi corazón <eos> Aquellos ojos tristes soñadores que yo amé <eos> La dejé por conquistar una ilusión <eos> Y perdí su rastro, y ahora sé que es ella <eos> Todo lo que yo buscaba <eos> Y ahora estoy aqui <eos> Buscándola de nuevo <eos> Ya no está, se fue <eos> Tal vez usted la ha visto digale <eos> Que yo siempre la adoré <eos> Y que nunca la olvidé <eos> Que mi vida es un desierto y muero yo de sed <eos> Y digale también, que sólo junto a ella puedo respirar <eos> No hay brillo en las estrellas <eos> Ya ni el sol, me calienta <eos> Y estoy muy solo aqui, no sé a donde fue <eos> Por favor digale usted <eos> Fueron tantos los momentos que la amé <eos> Que siento sus caricias y su olor esta en mi piel <eos> Cada noche la abrazaba junto a mi <eos> La cubría de besos, y entre mil caricias <eos> La llevaba a la locura <eos> * CORO <eos> 
Just a small-town girl <eos> Livin' in a lonely world <eos> She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> Just a city boy <eos> Born and raised in South Detroit <eos> He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> A singer in a smoky room <eos> The smell of wine and cheap perfume <eos> For a smile, they can share the night <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Workin' hard to get my fill <eos> Everybody wants a thrill <eos> Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time <eos> Some will win, some will lose <eos> Some are born to sing the blues <eos> Oh, the movie never ends <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> 
Letra de Sola de Nicole Horts <eos> Deja, te cuento lo que siento cuanto escucho tus palabras <eos> Me vuelvo fuego, pierdo tiempo, simplemente me traes harta <eos> No soy una mitad que no funciona si él no está <eos> Sola, ¿y qué? <eos> Solo déjame pasarla bien <eos> Solamente quiero desaparecerte <eos> Sola estoy bien <eos> Solo aléjate de una buena vez <eos> Sola soy suficiente <eos> No es el amor, es el modelo dibujado en el ambiente <eos> Hay señorita tan bonita, ya vendrá el que la contente <eos> Perdón otra vez pero esta sonrisa yo misma la creé <eos> Sola, ¿y qué? <eos> Solo déjame pasarla bien <eos> Solamente quiero desaparecerte <eos> Sola estoy bien <eos> Solo aléjate de una buena vez <eos> Sola soy suficiente <eos> Son varias voces las que gritan y tu ignorancia las calla <eos> Las lindas señoritas mejor solas que mal acompañadas <eos> No somos mitad <eos> Que se tenga que completar <eos> Sola, ¿y qué? <eos> Solo déjame pasarla bien <eos> Solamente quiero desaparecerte <eos> Sola estoy bien <eos> Solo aléjate de una buena vez <eos> Sola soy suficiente <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> Para <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> Para <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> Sola, ¿y qué? <eos> Solo déjame pasarla bien <eos> Solamente quiero desaparecerte <eos> Sola estoy bien <eos> Solo aléjate de una buena vez <eos> Sola soy suficiente <eos> Sola, ¿y qué? <eos> Solo déjame pasarla bien <eos> Solamente quiero desaparecerte <eos> Sola estoy bien <eos> Solo aléjate de una buena vez <eos> Solas somos suficiente <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> Para <eos> Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa <eos> 
Am I more than you bargained for yet? <eos> I've been dying to tell you <eos> Anything you want to hear <eos> 'Cause that's just who I am this week <eos> Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum <eos> I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song <eos> (Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song) <eos> Drop a heart <eos> And break a name <eos> We're always sleeping in and sleeping <eos> For the wrong team <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> Is this more than you bargained for yet? <eos> Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching <eos> You two from the closet <eos> Wishing to be the friction in your jeans <eos> Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him? <eos> I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song <eos> (Notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song) <eos> Drop a heart <eos> And break a name <eos> We're always sleeping in and sleeping <eos> For the wrong team <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> Down, down in an earlier round <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself) <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said) <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself) <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> We're going down, down (down, down) <eos> Down, down (down, down) <eos> We're going down, down (down, down) <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos> We're going down, down in an earlier round (Take aim at myself) <eos> And sugar, we're going down swinging (Take back what you said) <eos> I'll be your number one with a bullet (Take aim at myself) <eos> A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it <eos>

Oh, pour me another drink <eos> And punch me in the face <eos> You can call me Nancy <eos> Every man wears a symbol <eos> And I know I have mine <eos> I've got my right hand stamped <eos> In the concentration camp <eos> Where my organs scream <eos> "Slow down, man!" <eos> Ooh, how was I to know <eos> Milk and honey flowed <eos> Just a couple states below? <eos> Ooh <eos> Oh, hook me up to the tank <eos> And roll me to the door <eos> I'm going where my body leads me <eos> I can fend for myself <eos> With what looks I have left <eos> I'll put away a few <eos> And pretty soon I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes <eos> Ooh, how was I to know <eos> Milk and honey flowed <eos> Just a couple states below? <eos> Ooh, give me how it was <eos> Our place under the sun <eos> Before the devil made me run <eos> "Run, boy" <eos> "Run, boy" <eos> Ooh <eos> 
My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> I wish I could make it easy <eos> Easy to love me, love me <eos> But still I reach, to find a way <eos> I'm stuck here in between <eos> I'm looking for the right words to say <eos> I'm slowly drifting, drifting away <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave <eos> 
Gone a little far <eos> Gone a little far this time with something <eos> How was I to know? <eos> How was I to know this high came rushing? <eos> We're on the borderline <eos> Dangerously fine and unforgiven <eos> Possibly a sign <eos> I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday <eos> Here I go <eos> Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​ <eos> I wonder how I managed to end up in this place <eos> Where I couldn't get away <eos> We're on the borderline (Ooh) <eos> Caught between the tides of pain and rapture <eos> Then I saw the time <eos> Watched it speedin' by like a train <eos> Like a train <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Little closer, close enough <eos> I'm a loser, loosen up <eos> Setting free, must be tough <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be so in love? <eos> Any closer? Close enough <eos> Shout out to what is done <eos> R.I.P., here comes the sun <eos> (Comes the sun) <eos> Gone a little far <eos> Gone a little far this time with something <eos> Rudy said it's fine <eos> They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable) <eos> And we're on the borderline (Ooh) <eos> Caught between the tides of pain and rapture <eos> Then I saw the time <eos> Watched it speedin' by like a train <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Little closer, close enough <eos> I'm a loser, loosen up <eos> Setting free, must be tough <eos> Will I be known and loved? <eos> Is there one that I trust? <eos> Starting to sober up <eos> Has it been long enough? <eos> Will I be so in love? <eos> Any closer? Close enough <eos> Shout out to what is done <eos> R.I.P., here comes the sun <eos> (Comes the sun) <eos>

Dear, I fear we're facing a problem <eos> You love me no longer, I know and <eos> Maybe there is nothing that I can do <eos> To make you do <eos> Mama tells me I shouldn't bother <eos> That I ought just to stick to another man <eos> A man that surely deserves me <eos> But I think you do <eos> So I cry, and I pray, and I beg <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Pretend that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> So I cry and I beg for you to <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos> Lately I have desperately pondered <eos> Spent my nights awake and I wonder <eos> What I could have done in another way <eos> To make you stay <eos> Reason will not lead to solution <eos> I will end up lost in confusion <eos> I don't care if you really care <eos> As long as you don't go <eos> So I cry, and I pray, and I beg <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Pretend that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> So I cry and I beg for you to <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos> (Anything but you) <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> I know that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos>

Rewind, let's take it back a second <eos> We side off in a picture with grey ink and a knife <eos> These scars are deep enough to see for miles <eos> My oh my <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you <eos> Or maybe it's a heavy dose of deja vu <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you, without you <eos> Give me that medicine <eos> What a waste to suck that sedative <eos> There's no taste, there's no taste <eos> Daylight feels like a burden <eos> Got my eyes tight <eos> Just like that belt around my chest in the night <eos> I must've really done it this time <eos> Oh no, my oh my <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you <eos> Or maybe it's a heavy dose of deja vu <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you, without you <eos> Give me that medicine <eos> What a waste to suck that sedative <eos> There's no taste, there's no taste <eos> You need to understand <eos> It is my only friend <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you <eos> Maybe I've been here before without you, without you <eos> Give me that medicine <eos> What a waste to suck that sedative <eos> There's no taste, there's no taste <eos> Give me that medicine <eos> What a waste to suck that sedative <eos> There's no taste, there's no taste <eos> 
(Ooh ooh ooh) <eos> (Ooh ooh ooh) <eos> (Ooh ooh ooh) <eos> (Ooh ooh ooh) <eos> I am not the only traveler <eos> Who has not repaid his debt <eos> I've been searching for a trail to follow again <eos> Take me back to the night we met <eos> And then I can tell myself <eos> What the hell I'm supposed to do <eos> And then I can tell myself <eos> Not to ride along with you <eos> I had all and then most of you <eos> Some and now none of you <eos> Take me back to the night we met <eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to do <eos> Haunted by the ghost of you <eos> Oh, take me back to the night we met <eos> When the night was full of terrors <eos> And your eyes were filled with tears <eos> When you had not touched me yet <eos> Oh, take me back to the night we met <eos> I had all and then most of you <eos> Some and now none of you <eos> Take me back to the night we met <eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to do <eos> Haunted by the ghost of you <eos> Take me back to the night we met <eos>

Como fui <eos> A enamorarme de ti <eos> Habiendo tantas por ahí <eos> Habiendo tantas por ahí <eos> ¿Qué pasó? <eos> ¿Cómo me sucedió? <eos> Que no te puedo arrancar de mí <eos> Teniendo que vivir <eos> Este amor secreto <eos> Que quema a fuego lento <eos> Amor secreto <eos> Procesión que va por dentro <eos> Amor secreto <eos> Enamorado de una amiga <eos> Amor secreto <eos> El que te ama sin medida <eos> Amor secreto... <eos> Corazón <eos> Que no entiende razón <eos> Se enamoró esta vez de ti <eos> Se enamoró esta vez de ti <eos> Y yo estoy <eos> Entre la espada y la pared <eos> Ocultando este amor por ti <eos> Y tú estás con él <eos> Este amor secreto <eos> Que quema a fuego lento <eos> Amor secreto <eos> Procesión que va por dentro <eos> Amor secreto <eos> Enamorado de una amiga <eos> Amor secreto <eos> El que te ama sin medida <eos> Amor secreto... <eos> 
I wish I would've met you <eos> Now it's a little late <eos> What you could've taught me <eos> I could've saved some face <eos> They think that your early ending was all wrong <eos> For the most part, they're right <eos> But look how they all got strong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> Now that the smoke's gone <eos> And the air is all clear <eos> Those who were right there <eos> Got a new kind of fear <eos> You'd fight and you were right <eos> But they were just too strong <eos> They'd stick it in your face <eos> And let you smell what they consider wrong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> What a good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I'd say, "Nice shot." <eos> 
Talk, let's have conversations in the dark <eos> World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you <eos> Watch movies that we've both already seen <eos> I ain't even looking at the screen <eos> It's true, I got my eyes on you <eos> And you say that you're not worthy <eos> You get hung up on your flaws <eos> Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are <eos> I won't ever try to change you, change you <eos> I will always want the same you, same you <eos> Swear on everything I pray to <eos> That I won't break your heart <eos> I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely <eos> Keep the secrets that you told me, told me <eos> And your love is all you owe me <eos> And I won't break your heart <eos> On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon <eos> Oh, I could sleep forever next to you, next to you <eos> And we, we got places we both gotta be <eos> But there ain't nothing I would rather do <eos> Than blow off all my plans for you <eos> And you say that you're not worthy <eos> And get hung up on your flaws <eos> But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are <eos> As you are <eos> I won't ever try to change you, change you <eos> I will always want the same you, same you <eos> Swear on everything I pray to <eos> That I won't break your heart <eos> I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely <eos> Keep the secrets that you told me, told me <eos> And your love is all you owe me <eos> And I won't break your heart <eos> When no one seems to notice <eos> And your days, they seem so hard <eos> My darling, you should know this <eos> My love is everywhere you are <eos> I won't ever try to change you, change you (Yeah) <eos> I will always want the same you, same you (Oh-oh) <eos> Swear on everything I pray to <eos> That I won't break your heart (Yeah) <eos> I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely (Oh, when you get lonely) <eos> Keep the secrets that you told me, told me (Yeah-yeah) <eos> And your love is all you owe me <eos> And I won't break your heart <eos> Ooh <eos> Ooh <eos> I won't break your heart <eos> 
I've spent way too much time moving on <eos> Tried a couple of therapists <eos> Even got rid of some stuff <eos> It's like my mind got a mind of its own <eos> 'Cause I've been busy getting over <eos> Getting over someone <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like my skin isn't longing <eos> After the weight of your touch <eos> It's what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Someone left me with a broken heart <eos> That I passed on to someone <eos> And broke a new one apart <eos> Things can be good enough <eos> Still not enough <eos> And that's why I'm terrified <eos> Having you by my side <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like it ain't a habit <eos> Thinking 'bout "what if" too much <eos> Like what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> 
I need you, Christmas <eos> Friends by the fire to hold <eos> Times have been lonely <eos> And lately, I just feel alone <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Family with nowhere to go <eos> Angels on treetops and angels in the snow <eos> Oh, the cold <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I know <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> You don't ever change <eos> I miss the feeling <eos> Waiting for Santa to show <eos> Caroling late night <eos> And all the children's eyes aglow <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Oh, how I miss you the most <eos> Greetings from loved ones <eos> And lovers under mistletoe <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> If you're young, if you're old <eos> We all wait to be told <eos> Just a simple phrase <eos> "Have a Merry Christmas" <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Christmas, ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I hope <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> 'Cause I need you, Christmas <eos> 
In the thundering rain <eos> You stare into my eyes <eos> I can feel your hand <eos> Moving up my thighs <eos> Skirt around my waist <eos> Wall against my face <eos> I can feel your lips, ooh <eos> I don't wanna stop just because <eos> People walking by are watching us <eos> I don't give a damn what they think <eos> I want you now <eos> I don't wanna stop just because <eos> You feel so good inside of my love <eos> I'm not gonna stop no, no, no <eos> I want you <eos> All I wanna say is <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around, mmm <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around, no, no, no, no, no <eos> Dancing on the floor <eos> Feeling the slow groove <eos> My mind is starting to burn <eos> With forbidden thoughts <eos> Strangers all around <eos> With the lights down low <eos> I was thinking maybe we could <eos> Well... you know <eos> I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop baby) <eos> People standing around are watching us (Standing around are watching us) <eos> I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn) <eos> I want you now (I want you now) <eos> I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop) <eos> You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love) <eos> I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no) <eos> I want you ((I want you now)) <eos> All I wanna say is <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around (No, no, no, no, no, no, no) <eos> Any time baby <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around (Say it again, say it, oh yeah) <eos> Any time (Any time) <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around <eos> Baby, baby <eos> I don't care who's around <eos> Any time baby <eos> Any place sugar <eos> They pass, they can stare I don't care who's around <eos>

I survived the wasteland of tasting tongues but can't deny <eos> A beacon shined in blistered light for a while <eos> Burning in an open eye <eos> No room for improvement <eos> You're just some muse I use for joy <eos> The version of you I love is some other <eos> Not this virgin little boy <eos> Little souls, blood in bowls and poured on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Thundering loud, I stand up proud as lightning crashed the waves <eos> I don't want to stay, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I pulled you in my body <eos> The thought is really odd I know <eos> Does it alarm you or disarm you? <eos> I should have warned you, I didn't mean to harm you so <eos> I only said I wanted <eos> To bring you near, you flaunted how <eos> You were a loner and a stone <eos> Who didn't know if you could be my home right now <eos> Little signs are beacons shining out on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer storm, bodies worn with shimmering lakes <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I'll bet your sadness shimmers <eos> I pressed my tongue against your hair <eos> You invite me, you say “delight me, and come inside me” <eos> But there's no room to hide me there <eos> Am I a tortured glutton? <eos> Am I some portion of a whole? <eos> On your horizon, always shining, the beacon brightest <eos> I take my hands off all controls <eos> Little souls can take no more, I'm torn from everyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer haze, all decaying, hand around a blade <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing love's remains <eos> 
So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> 
Lovers, strangers. heart breaks, changes <eos> Every day things <eos> Been through it all <eos> Movies, cheap wine, claps and cloud nine <eos> All of this time <eos> I'm still longing for your love <eos> You woke me up in the middle of the night <eos> I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes <eos> So close but still so far away <eos> You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page <eos> I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways <eos> To close to let it slip away <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Bitter faces, holy places <eos> We left our traces <eos> Been through it all <eos> So forgive, forget, focus on me <eos> And all that darling <eos> I'm still longing for your love <eos> You woke me up in the middle of the night <eos> I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes <eos> So close but still so far away <eos> You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page <eos> I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways <eos> To close to let it slip away <eos> {Chorus (x2)] <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Love you better <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> 
Mmh-mmh, mmh <eos> No quiero borrar <eos> Todas las veces que me equivoqué <eos> No quiero quitar todas las piedras del camino <eos> Ni coser heridas que quedaron cuando tropecé <eos> No voy a olvidar <eos> Quién estuvo ahí las noches que me derrumbé <eos> Quién me dio la mano cuando me vio caer <eos> Quién prendió una vela cuando no podía ver <eos> No soy un ángel <eos> Nadie me enseñó a volar, no soy perfecta <eos> Sigo aprendiendo a caminar <eos> Imposible <eos> Tocar el cielo sin tocar el fondo <eos> Aprendí que lo bueno no es para siempre <eos> Y lo malo tampoco <eos> Ya lo hice <eos> Desperté y abracé mis demonios <eos> Llegar a aceptarlos fue duro, pero hasta la luna <eos> Tiene su lado oscuro <eos> Hoy puedo saber <eos> Que no hay dolor que no se cure con el tiempo <eos> Que no hay palabra que no se lleva el viento <eos> Que lo único que tengo es el momento <eos> No soy un ángel <eos> Nadie me enseñó a volar, no soy perfecta <eos> Sigo aprendiendo a caminar <eos> Imposible <eos> Tocar el cielo sin tocar el fondo <eos> Aprendí que lo bueno no es para siempre <eos> Y lo malo tampoco <eos> Ya lo hice <eos> Desperté y abracé a mis demonios <eos> Llegar a aceptarlos fue duro, pero hasta la luna <eos> Tiene su lado oscuro <eos> Oscuro <eos>

No hay mal que por bien no venga <eos> Por eso es que la extraña <eos> Ahora ella quiere que vuelva <eos> Pero yo ya me olvidé (Yeah) <eos> La vida me sale a cuenta <eos> Por fin me di cuenta que <eos> Podría tenerte cerca pero, eh <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien (Bien), sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero <eos> Te fuiste solito 'e mi casa <eos> No tengo nada que decirte <eos> Siempre dice' que algo te pasa <eos> Con eso ya me aburriste <eos> Podría escribirte pero te borré del celular <eos> Ya viste que me solté el pelo <eos> No voy a disimular que voy bien <eos> Que estar sin ti me gusta <eos> Tu enojo no me asusta <eos> Sé que no fui injusta, papá <eos> Sabes que no tengo la culpa <eos> Por eso ahora me buscas <eos> Es demasiado tarde para perdonar <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien, sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero (Yeah) <eos> A ti te tocó perder <eos> De tanto que sí, que no <eos> Volvió a llamar otra vez <eos> Pero esta vez se acabó <eos> Yo sé que no hay dos sin tres <eos> Y tú ya fallaste dos (Dos) <eos> Qué fácil pedir perdón <eos> Qué fácil pedir perdón, oye <eos> Ahora esta vida me tiene loco <eos> Viviendo arriba como un piloto <eos> Y ahora que pienso en lo de antes, no quiero ni verte porque to' me sabe a poco, yeh (¡No, no!) <eos> Se vive bien sin saber de nadie <eos> Se vive bien sin saber del otro <eos> Y si me ves por la calle no me hables, ni pidas, ya no hay nada entre nosotros, baby, porque <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien, sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero <eos> ¿Para qué si tú me traicionas, nene? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos>

We passed upon the stairs <eos> We spoke of was and when <eos> Although I wasn't there <eos> He said I was his friend <eos> Which came as a surprise <eos> I spoke into his eyes <eos> I thought you died alone <eos> A long long time ago <eos> Oh no, not me <eos> We never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos> I laughed and shook his hand <eos> And made my way back home <eos> I searched for foreign land <eos> For years and years I roamed <eos> I gazed a gazely stare <eos> We walked a million hills <eos> I must have died alone <eos> A long, long time ago <eos> Who knows? Not me <eos> I never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos> Who knows? Not me <eos> We never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos>

Otra noche que promete <eos> Ser igual de cruel <eos> Para mi corazon <eos> Una mas que pasare <eos> Sin escuchar tu voz <eos> Otra dosis de agonia <eos> Y yo sin encontrar <eos> Alguna solucion <eos> Todo me recuerda a ti <eos> En esta habitacion <eos> Esta casa que ha vivido <eos> En carne propia nuestro amor <eos> Cada cuadro que pusimos <eos> El jarron junto al sillon <eos> Las caricias que nos dimos <eos> Antes de decir adios <eos> Y esta foto, la primera de los dos <eos> No sabes como duele la vida <eos> No sabes como duele tu adios <eos> Yo se que nisiquiera imaginas <eos> El dano que me has hecho, mi amor <eos> No sabes como duele perderte <eos> No sabes come duele aceptar <eos> Que para mi es urgente olvidarte <eos> Y no tengo valor para empezar <eos> 
Always when we fight <eos> I try to make you laugh <eos> Til everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> Always when we fight <eos> I kiss you once or twice <eos> And everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> I love you Sunday song <eos> The weeks not yet begun <eos> And everything is quiet <eos> And it's always you and me <eos> Always and forever <eos> You and me always and forever <eos> And it was always <eos> You and me always <eos> You tell me I'm a real man <eos> And try to look impressed <eos> Not very convincing <eos> But you know I love it <eos> Now we watch TV <eos> Til we fall asleep <eos> Not very exciting <eos> But it's you and me <eos> And we'll always be together <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> 
Penso che un sogno cosi` non ritorni mai piu` <eos> Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu <eos> Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito <eos> E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> E volavo volavo felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva <eos> Lontano laggiu` <eos> Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscon perche` <eos> Quando tramonta la luna li porta con se` <eos> Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli <eos> Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> E continuo a volare felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare <eos> Negli occhi tuoi blu <eos> La tua voce e` una musica dolce che suona per me... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Ritorna <eos> 
Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> You came into my heart <eos> So tenderly <eos> With a burning love <eos> That stings like a bee <eos> Now that I surrender <eos> So helplessly <eos> You now wanna leave <eos> Ooh, you wanna leave me <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> Ooh, don't you want me? <eos> Don't you want me no more? <eos> Ooh, baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go <eos> And all your promises <eos> Of a love forever more <eos> I've got this burning, burning, yearning <eos> Feelin' inside me <eos> Ooh, deep inside me <eos> And it hurts so bad <eos> Before you won my heart <eos> You were a perfect guy <eos> But now that you got me <eos> You wanna leave me behind <eos> (Baby, baby) ooh baby <eos> Baby, baby <eos> Baby don't leave me <eos> Ooh, please don't leave me <eos> All by myself <eos> Ooh, baby, baby <eos> Where did our love go? <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> 
The last time we met was down at the Tap Room <eos> Mezcal on Sunday with tears in our eyes <eos> You sang me a song sweet as a monsoon blowing in from the South <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> I sat on the hill near the mission <eos> Where lovers meet and when poppies bloom <eos> I followed the ranchers rambling down Broadway <eos> Selling crops on the side of the road <eos> Their hearts in Sonora whenever it rains and wherever they roam <eos> Takе this charm and dry your tears <eos> Won't you wear it to easе your mind <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> Heard the radio blaring a sad corrido <eos> "La tierra del sol suspiro por verte <eos> Quisiera llorar, quisiera morrir" <eos> Come this November's Procession <eos> Mezcal on Sunday with tears in our eyes <eos> 'Cause it's foolish to laugh and pointless to cry <eos> About some old photos buried inside the cracked and crumbling walls <eos> Take this charm and dry your tears <eos> Won't you wear it to ease your mind <eos> Take a breath to soothe your sorrows <eos> Until they're gone, gone as the years fade away <eos> Hear the bells ringing out <eos> Let 'em ring on New Year's Day <eos> 
Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie <eos> Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre supe aceptarme <eos> De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores <eos> Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí <eos> Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel <eos> Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte <eos> Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me alejé y en cambio quise <eos> Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas <eos> Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia; <eos> Y siempre me estoy imaginando <eos> Las veces que él te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos <eos> Me muero de envidia <eos> Envidia, queriendo ser luna en la noche <eos> Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche <eos> Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre <eos> Y amarte hasta que se te olvide... su nombre <eos> Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad <eos> El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena <eos> Que será mi condena... que me va a matar <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Ay me muero de envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia y te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> No sé lo que me pasa, esta maldita envidia <eos> Que va a acabar conmigo yo lo sé, si no te hago mía <eos> Va contra mis principios mi moral, querer amar a una mujer que es ajena <eos> Vivir así no puedo más, en esta agonía <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> Te digo no puedo más <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> No puedo, no puedo más <eos>

The other night when we kissed <eos> You told me I was yours forever <eos> But when I woke up the next morning, you were gone <eos> Come back baby <eos> Come into my arms <eos> You, you showed me how love could be <eos> Just show me how much you need <eos> You've always been by my side <eos> Oh, baby that's no lie <eos> 'Cause I, I've always been true to you <eos> I've always loved one, that's true <eos> Oh baby, can't you see that it's you <eos> You know that I love you so <eos> Chorus: <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real <eos> I've always been too much for you it burns inside <eos> To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side <eos> Repeat (2x) <eos> You, you shared your thoughts with me <eos> You shared your secrecies <eos> And oh, how that makes me feel <eos> Listen baby, lets be forever <eos> 'Cause I, I know I will always be good <eos> I know in my heart I should <eos> I'll never ever do you wrong <eos> My love for you is strong <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> We, we can't just let this die <eos> You gotta give our love a try <eos> Oh please be by my side <eos> Don't even begin to cry <eos> 'Cause I, I'm waiting to be with you <eos> Just give me the chance to prove <eos> That I'm the only one for you <eos> You know I was the one <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side, your not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> So please be by my side <eos> Please be by my side <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> This love for you is real <eos> It burns inside <eos> I know you're sorry you did me wrong <eos> But until then I'll remember <eos> You'll be back, back into my arms <eos> 
Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> De mi Cuba soberana, recuerdo aquel murmurillo <eos> Del río, junto al  bohío que era una estampa cubana <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> La libertad fue un trofeo, que nos conquistó el Bambi <eos> Con el verbo de Martí, y el machete de Maceo <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> "Yo soy un hombre sincero", dijo Martí, de donde crece la palma <eos> Y antes de morirme quiero, cantar mis versos del alma <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Cultivó una rosa blanca, en junio como en enero <eos> Para el amigo sincero que me da su mano franca <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos> Guantanamera, guajira, guantanamera <eos>

Home is where I want to be <eos> Pick me up and then turn me 'round <eos> I feel numb, born with a weak heart <eos> I guess I must be having fun <eos> The less we say about it the better <eos> Make it up as we go along <eos> Feet on the ground, head in the sky <eos> It's ok I know nothing's wrong, nothing <eos> Hi, I got plenty of time <eos> Hi, you got light in your eyes <eos> And you're standing here beside me <eos> I love the passing of time <eos> Never for money, always for love <eos> Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight <eos> Home, is where I want to be <eos> But I guess I'm already there <eos> I come home she lifted up her wings <eos> Guess that this must be the place <eos> I can't tell one from (the) another <eos> Did I find you, or you find me? <eos> There was a time, before we were born <eos> If someone asks, this where I'll be, where I'll be <eos> Hi, we drift in and out <eos> Hi, sing into my mouth <eos> Out of all those kinds of people <eos> You got a face with a view <eos> I'm just an animal looking for a home <eos> Share the same space for a minute or two <eos> And you love me till my heart stops <eos> Love me till I'm dead <eos> Eyes that light up, eyes look through you <eos> Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head and say ah <eos> Aah (aah) <eos> Ooh <eos> Ooh <eos> Ooh <eos> 
I know there’s a lotta <eos> Talk <eos> I know there’s a lot of talk between the three of us <eos> Your colours show, you say hello <eos> And all else fades into the wash of life <eos> You can put a little spell on me for all you like <eos> The truth is shone in better lights <eos> And all else fades into the depth of night <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that same old trick <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that cheap magic <eos> C-H-E-A-P <eos> M-A-G-I-C <eos> I see you <eos> With a little bit of push and shove the three of us <eos> We tell a lie to say goodbye <eos> And all else fades into the black and white <eos> You can put another blindfold on for all you like <eos> The hands they move without a sight <eos> And all else fades into the wrongest right, right <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that same old trick <eos> And I tell ya <eos> You can’t fool us now with that cheap magic <eos> I wanna show you what you doing to us <eos> That same old trick you got that magical touch <eos> I wanna show you what you doing to us <eos> That same old trick you got that magical touch <eos> 
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart <eos> Without saying a word you can light up the dark <eos> Try as I may I could never explain <eos> What I hear when you don't say a thing <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> All day long I can hear people talking out loud <eos> But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd <eos> Old Mister Webster could never define <eos> What's being said between your heart and mine <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> 
Alright, Rock 'n' Roll, yeah <eos> At the end of a dream <eos> If you know where I mean <eos> When the mist just starts to clear <eos> In a similar way <eos> At the end of today <eos> I could feel the sound of writing on the wall <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the least that you can do <eos> Like a spiral on the wine <eos> I can hear it screamin' in my mind <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Let it live <eos> In a different time <eos> When the words didn't rhyme <eos> You could never quite be sure <eos> Then on with the change <eos> It was simple but strange <eos> And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the least that you can do <eos> Like a spiral on the wine <eos> I can hear it screamin' in my mind <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> I'm losing control <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Look here, If you suddenly see <eos> What has happened to me <eos> You should spread the word around <eos> And tell everyone here <eos> That it's perfectly clear <eos> They can sail above it all on what they've found <eos> It cries for you <eos> It's the best that you can do <eos> Like a sound that's everywhere <eos> I can hear it screaming through the air <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Let it live <eos> Let it live <eos> Let it live <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> That is how I weight the perfect playing this <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> Long live rock 'n' roll <eos> Long live rock and roll <eos> 
The first time I ever talked to you <eos> My heart told me you were a dream came true <eos> And the first time you put your hand in mine <eos> I was wishing it would last a lifetime <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> And we kept close under the mistletoe <eos> As we watched the moonlit shadow in the snow <eos> And it was then, that I knew for sure <eos> That I got just what I asked for <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> I know I see angels <eos> When I look in your eyes <eos> When I wake Christmas Day <eos> You'll be my big surprise <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>  Well, Ron, you know Christmas is all the same man <eos> Yeah, Mike, and I can't wait to the 25th <eos>  Because I know my mother bought me something very special <eos>  Special? There's nothing more special <eos> Than being under the Christmas tree with your family <eos> Opening gifts, spreading love, that's a serious feeling <eos>  Well fellas, let's remember that the spirit of Christmas is all about giving <eos> What do you think, Ralph? <eos>  What, who me, Rick? Well, the greatest gift I could ever have <eos> Is to spend Christmas with my two favorite girls: <eos> My mother and of course my Candy Girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> (All I want for Christmas, Christmas is my girl) <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos> All I want for Christmas is my girl <eos>

What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now?

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack Frost nippin' at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like Eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that Santa’s on his way <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And every mother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so I’m offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to 92 <eos> Although it's been said many times, many ways <eos> Merry Christmas to you <eos> And so I'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to 92 <eos> Although it's been said many times, many ways <eos> Merry Christmas— <eos> Oh, merry Christmas <eos> Oh, merry Christmas to you <eos> 
Last night I took a walk in the snow <eos> Couples holding hands, places to go <eos> Seems like everyone but me is in love <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss <eos> I sent it off, it just said this: <eos> "I know exactly what I want this year" <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I want my baby, baby <eos> I want someone to love me <eos> Someone to hold <eos> Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe) <eos> He'll be all my own in a big red bow <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I have been so good this year <eos> And all I want is one thing: <eos> Tell me my true love is near <eos> He's all I want, just for me <eos> Underneath my Christmas tree <eos> I'll be waiting here <eos> Santa, that's my only wish this year <eos> Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep <eos> Would I be wrong for taking a peek? <eos> 'Cause I heard that you're coming to town <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I really hope that you're on your way <eos> With something special for me in your sleigh <eos> Oh, please make my wish come true <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I want my baby, baby (oh) <eos> I want someone to love me <eos> Someone to hold <eos> Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe) <eos> We'll be all the love under the mistletoe <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I have been so good this year <eos> And all I want is one thing <eos> Tell me my true love is near <eos> He's all I want, just for me <eos> Underneath my Christmas tree <eos> I'll be waiting here <eos> Santa, that's my only wish this year <eos> I hope my letter reaches you in time, oh yeah <eos> Bring me love I can call all mine, oh yeah yeah <eos> 'Cause I have been so good, so good this year <eos> Can't be alone under the mistletoe <eos> He's all I want in a big red bow <eos> Santa, can you hear me? <eos> I have been so good this year <eos> And all I want is one thing <eos> Tell me my true love is near <eos> He's all I want, just for me <eos> Underneath my Christmas tree <eos> I'll be waiting here, oh yeah <eos> Santa, that's my only wish this year (ah) <eos> Oh, Santa!

Yeah <eos> In the year 1986 <eos> Havoc & Prodeje had a masterplan <eos> To put South Central on the map <eos> And stay strapped <eos> And peel your cap if you trip <eos> And make much snaps <eos> Like the song say <eos> Our main goal is to stay paid n full <eos> Thinking of a master plan <eos> Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand <eos> So I dig into my pocket all my money is spent so I dig deeper <eos> But still comin up with lint so I <eos> Start my mission, leave my residence <eos> Thinkin how could I get some dead presidents <eos> I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid <eos> So I think of all the devious things I did <eos> I used to roll up, this is a hold up <eos> Ain't nuthin' funny stop smilin' <eos> Be still, don't nothing move but the money <eos> But now I learned to earn cause I'm righteous <eos> I feel straight so maybe I might just <eos> Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive <eos> Then maybe I'll stay alive <eos> So I walk up the street whistling this <eos> Feeling out of place cause man, do I miss <eos> A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of <eos> Havoc, Prodeje and a nice big plate of - fish <eos> Which is my favorite dish <eos> But without my money it's still a wish <eos> Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid <eos> So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made <eos> To now test to see if I got pull <eos> Hit the studio cause I'm paid in full <eos> Chorus... <eos> Bustin rhymes in the S.C. streets now I'm paid in full <eos> Bustin rhymes in the S.C. streets now I'm paid in full <eos> Just ride <eos> For my homies on the east and the west side puttin' it down <eos> Just ride <eos> For my peoples on the north and the south side puttin' it down <eos> I gotta stack a end, kickin' with the G's <eos> 16 switches 64 on gold D's <eos> Havoc & the Prodeje figure we was ???? <eos> But truce never stop even though we still rollin <eos> S.C. streets, we ain't playa-hated <eos> The rest try to scramble, we'll never tolerate it <eos> Cause it's just two players out the cut to get funky <eos> And kick you in the ass like a donkey <eos> G's make the world go round, I'm talking 6 figure digits <eos> The stuff that makes the Big Willie ???? <eos> The illegitimate, mindless ????? I'm payin' all the ???? <eos> Rollin' through the hood in Armani <eos> The young John Gotti be parlaying, packin 44's <eos> Swervin' through yo' hood, smashin' those <eos> Bustas, who thought I had a minimum flow <eos> But on a scale from 1 to 10 I'm like a 9.0 <eos> Chorus... <eos>

Have you got colour in your cheeks? <eos> Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type <eos> That sticks around like summat in your teeth? <eos> Are there some aces up your sleeve? <eos> Have you no idea that you're in deep? <eos> I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week <eos> How many secrets can you keep? <eos> 'Cause there's this tune I found <eos> That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat <eos> Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee <eos> (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways? <eos> (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay <eos> (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made <eos> For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <eos> Crawlin' back to you <eos> Ever thought of callin' when <eos> You've had a few? <eos> 'Cause I always do <eos> Maybe I'm too <eos> Busy bein' yours <eos> To fall for somebody new <eos> Now, I've thought it through <eos> Crawlin' back to you <eos> So have you got the guts? <eos> Been wonderin' if your heart's still open <eos> And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts <eos> Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt <eos> It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you <eos> I don't know if you feel the same as I do <eos> But we could be together if you wanted to <eos> (Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways? <eos> (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay <eos> (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made <eos> For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <eos> Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you) <eos> Ever thought of callin' when <eos> You've had a few?

If this feelin' flows both ways? <eos> (Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay <eos> (Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made <eos> For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day <eos> (Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall <eos> (Sad to see you go) Ever thought of callin', darlin'? <eos> (Do I wanna know?) Do you want me crawlin' back to you? <eos> 
Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I'll never kill myself to save my soul) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I didn't come this far to sink so low) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> I'm just weathering a rough patch <eos> Another villain with an itch to scratch <eos> Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole <eos> Why does the hell make you feel so cold? <eos> Make a move and you pay for it <eos> Pick a lord and you pray to it <eos> You're so demanding when you want the truth <eos> But your stories don't read for me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> Indecision overload <eos> Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road <eos> Reaching out for the hand of God <eos> But did you think you'd shake your own? <eos> This killing field is all grown over <eos> The motherfucker wants it wild <eos> Go sow your oats in alphabetical order <eos> The anti-antagonist is back in style <eos> Myopic, cannot see straight <eos> Dystopic, one sin too late <eos> You gotta lie if you wanna believe <eos> But your bibles don't work on me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting <eos> Go <eos> Did you think you could win? And fill me in? <eos> Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin <eos> I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me <eos> I was more than you thought I could be <eos> So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos> 
When night time comes <eos> And I'm ten thousand miles away <eos> Just lose yourself <eos> And watch the band kick back and play <eos> Get up keep in line <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> You say, you're feeling fine <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> Get a load off your mind <eos> This place is right it's hard to find <eos> The mood is set alright <eos> It's going to be a long, long night <eos> You keep spinning around <eos> You find it hard to touch the ground <eos> And time is all it takes <eos> You'll find it easy once you make <eos> Get up, keep in line <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> Getting tighter <eos> 
Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain <eos> Out of your favorite dress? <eos> Black mascara off a pillowcase? <eos> Cure a one-too-many headache? <eos> Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days <eos> This weekend or next? <eos> And hey, how do you get a red wine stain <eos> Out of your favorite dress? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> Can you ask Daddy if he's got time <eos> To come and look at my front door? <eos> It got slammed last night <eos> And now it don't close right <eos> And just promise that you won't tell him everything <eos> And keep that pistol in the drawer <eos> Mama, please don't say <eos> I'm gonna laugh about this someday <eos> You didn't see the way he drove away <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> Oh, a broken heart <eos> Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard) <eos> Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark) <eos> Was it ever really real <eos> If he don't feel like I feel? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> A broken heart <eos> 
I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos>

The town lights beneath the mountain side seem so dim <eos> As you lay there with your pensive mind in search for a hymn <eos> Then you realize that all thats left is your sad song <eos> That you sing to yourself, cuz no ones gonna come along <eos> You’ve lost your head you have lost your mind <eos> You really lost everything for me this time <eos> You’re broken now, you were broken then <eos> You’ve broken everything you meant to mend <eos> And now you’re spent <eos> But I know what you meant <eos> By what you say <eos> As the town lights fade <eos> From the mountaintop you can see the world through my eyes <eos> I begin to find that you're fed up with all the villagers’ lies <eos> The inspiration you had had  made the journey long <eos> So you sang a song, so you sang a song <eos> 
Hey, mom, I know we're gettin' old <eos> And the lines on our hands have changed <eos> But you still look at me the same <eos> Hey, mom, guess what? You're really tough <eos> And I know you did all you could <eos> Just to make sure my life was good <eos> Sorry for the fights and the tone of my voice <eos> Sorry for the nights when I made the wrong choice <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go to the mall and buy some shoes <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey, dad, what's up? Miss you so much <eos> Yeah, the shade of your hair has changed <eos> But I look up to you the same <eos> Taught me how to fish, taught me how to ride a bike <eos> Taught me how to love, how to treat a woman right <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go for a drive or watch the news <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey you, sit back <eos> Don't go so fast <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> So let's do the things we always do <eos> Or maybe we try something brand new <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos>

When the rain is blowing in your face <eos> And the whole world is on your case <eos> I could offer you a warm embrace <eos> To make you feel my love <eos> When the evening shadows and the stars appear <eos> And there is no one there to dry your tears <eos> I could hold you for a million years <eos> To make you feel my love <eos> I know you haven't made your mind up yet <eos> But I will never do you wrong <eos> I've known it from the moment that we met <eos> No doubt in my mind where you belong <eos> I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue <eos> I'd go crawling down the avenue <eos> Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do <eos> To make you feel my love <eos> The storms are raging on the rollin' sea <eos> And on the highway of regret <eos> The winds of change are blowing wild and free <eos> You ain't seen nothing like me yet <eos> I could make you happy, make your dreams come true <eos> Nothing that I wouldn't do <eos> Go to the ends of the earth for you <eos> To make you feel my love <eos> To make you feel my love <eos>

(Honeycomb) <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> Well it's a darn good life <eos> And it's kinda funny <eos> How the Lord made the bee <eos> And the bee made the honey <eos> And the honeybee lookin' for a home <eos> And they called it honeycomb <eos> And they roamed the world and they gathered all <eos> Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball <eos> And the honeycomb from a million trips <eos> Made my baby's lips <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord said now that I made a bee <eos> I'm gonna look all around for a green, green tree <eos> And He made a little tree and I guess you heard <eos> What then, well, he made a little bird <eos> And they waited all around till the end of Spring <eos> Gettin' every note that the birdie'd sing <eos> And they put 'em all into one sweet tome <eos> For my Honeycomb <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> And the Lord says now that I made a bird <eos> I'm gonna look all round for a little ol' word <eos> That sounds about sweet like "turtledove" <eos> And I guess I'm gonna call it "love" <eos> And He roamed the world lookin' everywhere <eos> Gettin' love from here, love from there <eos> And He put it all in a little ol' part <eos> Of my baby's heart <eos> Oh, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone <eos> And made a walkin' talkin' Honeycomb <eos> Well, Honeycomb, won't you be my baby <eos> Well, Honeycomb, be my own <eos> What a darn good life <eos> When you got a wife like Honeycomb <eos> (Honeycomb) <eos> 
Je ne rêve plus, je ne fume plus, je n'ai même plus d'histoire <eos> Je suis sale sans toi, je suis laid sans toi <eos> Je suis comme un orphelin dans un dortoir <eos> Je n'ai plus envie de vivre ma vie, ma vie cesse quand tu pars <eos> Je n'ai plus de vie et même mon lit <eos> Se transforme en quai de gare quand tu t'en vas <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> T'arrives on ne sait jamais quand, tu r'pars on ne sait jamais où <eos> Et ça va faire bientôt deux ans que tu t'en fous <eos> Comme à un rocher, comme à un péché, je suis accroché à toi <eos> Je suis fatigué, je suis épuisé <eos> De faire semblant d'être heureux quand ils sont là <eos> Je bois toutes les nuits mais tous les whiskys, pour moi, ont le même goût <eos> Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau <eos> Je ne sais plus où aller, tu es partout <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Je verse mon sang dans ton corps <eos> Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi, tu dors <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Pourtant, moi, j'avais du talent avant ta peau <eos> Cet amour me tue, si ça continue, je crèverai seul avec moi <eos> Près de ma radio, comme un gosse idiot <eos> Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, c'est ça, je suis malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Et j'ai le cœur complètement malade <eos> Cerné de barricades, t'entends ? Je suis malade ! <eos>

Get off your sled and go to bed <eos> Don't you ever tire? <eos> Throw a bone, I'm finally home <eos> Curled up by the fire <eos> Snow is falling from the sky <eos> Like ashes from an urn <eos> Sweet dreams, my little one <eos> Now it's my turn <eos> Well, Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> Now, when I sleep I like to dream <eos> Of rabbits in the snow <eos> Jumping right into my jaws <eos> From their rabbit hole <eos> Take one home and set him down <eos> Right next to your shoes <eos> Wake up to a big surprise <eos> My gift to you <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> So I'll just stay here and chew <eos> 
I felt it from the start <eos> It grew inside my heart <eos> It changed me from that day <eos> This love I can't contain <eos> I waited for a sign <eos> So patient and divine <eos> For fate was on our side <eos> That day I came to find <eos> That you are all <eos> I was hoping for <eos> It's you I'll call <eos> My evermore <eos> The garden as our home <eos> A place where we can grow <eos> You're planted in my soul <eos> To nurture and to hold <eos> 'Cause you are all <eos> I was hoping for <eos> It's you I'll call <eos> My evermore <eos> 'Cause you are all <eos> I was hoping for <eos> It's you I'll call <eos> My evermore <eos> 
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño <eos> When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino <eos> As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name <eos> Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came <eos> I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school <eos> Never going, never showing up when we had to <eos> Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave <eos> I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall <eos> But what would you expect with a conscience so small? <eos> Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised <eos> Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised <eos> 'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and <eos> Cutting people down is just a minor offense then <eos> It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn <eos> I'm sick of being told to wait my turn <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Don't count on me to let you know when <eos> Don't count on me, I'll do it again <eos> Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing <eos> Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening <eos> Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat <eos> Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing <eos> You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin <eos> But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing <eos> 'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook <eos> You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book <eos> I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion <eos> The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Casualty of society <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Victim of your conformity and back down <eos> 
I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> I'm a friend of thunder <eos> Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me <eos> I've fought with the devil <eos> Got down on his level <eos> But I never gave in, so he gave up on me <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> I can spot bad weather <eos> And I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour <eos> I've been sacrificed by brothers <eos> Crucified by lovers <eos> But through it all I withstood the pain <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> But when I get that foggy feeling <eos> When I'm a feeling down <eos> If I don't keep my head up, I may drown <eos> But it's hard to keep believing <eos> I'll even come out even <eos> While the rain beats your hope in the ground <eos> And tonight it's really coming down <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> But there'll always be tomorrow <eos> And I'll beg, steal or borrow a little sunshine <eos> And I'll put this cloud behind me <eos> That's how the Man designed me <eos> To ride the wind and dance in a hurricane <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> Oh no, I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> I'm a friend of thunder <eos> Friend, is it any wonder lightning strikes me <eos> But I'll put this cloud behind me <eos> That's how the Man designed me <eos> Ride the wind and dance in a hurricane <eos> I'm no stranger to the rain <eos> Oh no, I'm no stranger to the rain <eos>

I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me <eos> You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy <eos> There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you <eos> You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you <eos> I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you <eos> How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you <eos> You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in <eos> That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much <eos> Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started <eos> I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted <eos> Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding <eos> Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing <eos> Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar <eos> I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler <eos> Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning <eos> We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> And I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> 
I'm driving home for Christmas <eos> Oh, I can't wait to see those faces <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah <eos> Well, I'm moving down that line <eos> And it's been so long <eos> But I will be there <eos> I sing this song <eos> To pass the time away <eos> Driving in my car <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> It's gonna take some time but I'll get there <eos> Top to toe in tailbacks <eos> Oh, I got red lights all around <eos> But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah <eos> Get my feet on holy ground <eos> So I sing for you <eos> Though you can't hear me <eos> When I get through <eos> And feel you near me <eos> Driving in my car <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> With a thousand memories <eos> I take look at the driver next to me <eos> He's just the same <eos> Just the same <eos> Top to toe in tailbacks <eos> Oh, I got red lights all around <eos> I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah <eos> Get my feet on holy ground <eos> So I sing for you <eos> Though you can't hear me <eos> When I get through <eos> Oh and feel you near me <eos> Driving in my car <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> With a thousand memories <eos> I take look at the driver next to me <eos> He's just the same <eos> He's driving home, driving home <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> Driving home for Christmas <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> 
Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> I find myself growing in an environment <eos> Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent <eos> In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations <eos> I've seen where some have died in desperation <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto) <eos> Hustling is the only education I know <eos> Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle <eos> A situation like this is getting too hard to handle <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> With a pregnant woman, yes <eos> And five kids to care for <eos> Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town <eos> As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me <eos> I pray the day will come when I shall be free from <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh, live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury <eos> Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy <eos> Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon <eos> I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Now a fugitive at large <eos> Could this be my destiny? <eos> With no one to care for the wellfare of my family <eos> In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure <eos> For mind and soul would soon be weary <eos> Just couldn't take no more <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song <eos>

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the ones I used to know <eos> Where the treetops glisten and children listen <eos> To hear sleigh bells in the snow <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> With every Christmas card I write <eos> "May your days be merry and bright <eos> Blanca Navidad" <eos> Ah, blanca Navidad <eos> Sueño que cae nieve al rededor <eos> Y la noche buena es mensajera <eos> De paz, de magia y de amor <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the onеs I used to know <eos> Where thе treetops glisten and children listen <eos> Blanca Navidad <eos> "May your days be merry and bright <eos> And may all your Christmases be white" <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> 
Dennis DJ <eos> MC G15 <eos> Para pra pensar se a gente é acidente <eos> Se foi por acaso que o beijo que rolou <eos> Deve ser coisa de Deus na minha frente <eos> Porque, de tantas bocas, a nossa encaixou <eos> (Ô, Senhor, agora, sim!) <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada (Me dá uma sentada) <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Oi, vem) <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o bumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Bumbumbumbumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o... vai, vai, vai <eos> Dennis DJ, sou teu fã! <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Vai, vai, vai, vai) <eos> 
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining <eos> It's the night of our dear Savior's birth <eos> Long lay the world in sin and error pining <eos> 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth <eos> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <eos> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn <eos> Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices! <eos> O night divine, O night when Christ was born <eos> O night divine, O night divine! <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos>

She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending" <eos> I'll keep stealing, breathing her <eos> Birds are leaving over autumn's ending <eos> One of us will die inside these arms <eos> Eyes wide open <eos> Naked as we came <eos> One will spread our ashes 'round the yard <eos> She says, "If I leave before you, darling <eos> Don't you waste me in the ground" <eos> I lay smiling like our sleeping children <eos> One of us will die inside these arms <eos> Eyes wide open <eos> Naked as we came <eos> One will spread our ashes 'round the yard <eos>

Life's like a road that you travel on <eos> When there's one day here and the next day gone <eos> Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand <eos> Sometimes you turn your back to the wind <eos> There's a world outside every darkened door <eos> Where blues won't haunt you anymore <eos> Where the brave are free and lovers soar <eos> Come ride with me to the distant shore <eos> We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate <eos> There's not much time left today <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> Through all the cities and all these towns <eos> It's in my blood and it's all around <eos> I love you now like I loved you then <eos> This is the road and these are the hills <eos> From Mozambique to those Memphis nights <eos> The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights <eos> Knock me down, get back up again <eos> You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man <eos> There's no load I can't hold <eos> The roads are rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, hmm <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> There was a distance between you and I <eos> A misunderstanding once <eos> But now we look it in the eye <eos> Oh <eos> There ain't no load that I can't hold <eos> Road so rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, ooh <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos>

We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> The music played <eos> While our bodies <eos> Displayed through the dance <eos> Then love picked us out for romance <eos> I thought it was clear <eos> The plan was we would share <eos> This feeling just between ourselves <eos> But when the music changed <eos> The plan was rearranged <eos> He went to dance with someone else <eos> We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> But now he's with somebody new <eos> What does love want me to do? <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Guess he's discovered <eos> We are truly lovers <eos> Magic from the very start <eos> 'Cause love just kept me groovin' <eos> And he felt me movin' <eos> Even though we danced apart <eos> So we started dancing <eos> And love put us into the groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Love said <eos> (Let the music play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> (He won't get away) <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away... <eos>

At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops <eos> With him on top, lemon yellow sun <eos> Arms raised in a "V" <eos> And the dead lay in pools of maroon below <eos> Daddy didn't give attention <eos> Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Clearly, I remember picking on the boy <eos> Seemed a harmless little fuck <eos> Ooh, but we unleashed a lion <eos> Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast <eos> How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left <eos> My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open <eos> Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard <eos> Daddy didn't give affection, no <eos> And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Try to forget this (Try to forget this) <eos> Try to erase this (Try to erase this) <eos> From the blackboard <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in...) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> Ooh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh <eos> Ooh oh, oh (Spoke in...) <eos> 
A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos> 
I remember when I met you <eos> I didn't want to fall <eos> I felt my hands were shaking 'cause you looked so beautiful <eos> I remember when you kissed me <eos> I knew you were the one <eos> And oh my hands were shaking when you played my favorite song <eos> I don't know why, but every time I look into your eyes <eos> I see a thousand falling shooting stars and yes I love you <eos> I can't believe that every night you're by my side <eos> Promise I'll stay here 'till the morning <eos> And pick you up when you're falling <eos> When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough <eos> I'll just sweep you off your feet and fix you with my love <eos> My only one <eos> My only one <eos> Tell me how you do it <eos> I can barely breathe with the smile you get <eos> You get the best of me and all I really want is to give you all of me <eos> Tell me how you do it <eos> How you bring me back <eos> You bring me back to life then make my heartbeat stop, I can't take it <eos> I don't know why, but every time I look into your eyes <eos> I see a thousand falling shooting stars and yes I love you <eos> I can't believe that every night you're by my side <eos> Voy a cuidarte por las noches <eos> Voy a amarte sin reproches <eos> Te voy a extrañar en la tempestad <eos> Y aunque existan mil razones para renunciar <eos> Promise I'll stay here 'till the morning <eos> And pick you up when you're falling <eos> When the rain gets rough, when you've had enough <eos> I'll just sweep you off your feet and fix you with my love <eos> My only one, there's no one else <eos> My only one, there's no one else <eos> You are my only one <eos> It's just there's no one else, ouh, uoh <eos> My only one <eos> My only <eos>

If I was in heaven with you <eos> I wouldn't cry for a long time <eos> If I was in the middle with you <eos> I would be free to speak my mind <eos> Ooh, would you lie down? <eos> See those clothes I'm wearing now? <eos> Tell me where my faith is <eos> Or is it off the road? <eos> Ooh, would you lie down? <eos> Tell me which birds are in the sky <eos> Or which flowers lie at the edge of the wood <eos> If I was in the garden with you <eos> You would tell me how it turned out right <eos> If I was at the table with you <eos> I would see, I'd see your crown <eos> Ooh, would you lie down? <eos> See those books I'm reading now? <eos> Are you in the dark or are you gone for good? <eos> Ooh, would you lie down? <eos> Tell me which birds are in the sky <eos> Or which flowers lie by the side of the road <eos> 
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> And I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> 'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos>

He intentado casi todo para convencerte, uh <eos> Mientras el mundo se derrumba todo, aquí a mis pies, yeah <eos> Mientras aprendo de esta soledad que desconozco, woah <eos> Me vuelvo a preguntar quizás si sobreviviré <eos> Porque sin ti me queda la conciencia helada y vacía <eos> Porque sin ti me he dado cuenta amor que no renaceré, yeah <eos> Porque he ido más allá del límite de la desolación <eos> Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Ay, yo te juro que <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida (No) <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Qué no dejaría <eos> Y duelen más la' cosa' buena' cuando estás ausente <eos> Yo sé que e' demasiado tarde para remediar <eos> No me queda bien valerme de diez mil excusas <eos> Cuando definitivamente sé que ahora te vas <eos> Y aunque no lo pueda cambiar, yo seguiré esperándote <eos> Por si algún día tú me quiere' ver bien <eos> Aunque te vuelva a repetir que estoy muriendo día a día <eos> Aunque también estés muriendo, tú no me perdonarás <eos> Aunque sin ti haya llegado al límite de la desolación <eos> Y mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Yo sigo muriéndome <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión (Mi religión) <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos (Yeah) <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe, oh <eos> CNCO <eos> 
I was following the, I was following the <eos> I was following the, I was following the <eos> I was following the, I was following the <eos> I was following the, I was following the <eos> I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats <eos> With scarves of red tied 'round their throats <eos> To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow <eos> And I turned 'round and there you go <eos> And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow <eos> Red as strawberries in the summertime <eos> I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats <eos> With scarves of red tied 'round their throats <eos> To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow <eos> And I turned 'round and there you go <eos> And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow <eos> Red as strawberries in the summertime <eos> I was following the pack, all swallowed in their coats <eos> With scarves of red tied 'round their throats <eos> To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow <eos> And I turned 'round and there you go <eos> And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow <eos> Red as strawberries in the summertime <eos> 
Feel the ocean as it breathes <eos> Shivering teeth <eos> See the mountains where they meet <eos> Smothering me <eos> As the wind fends off the waves <eos> I count down the days <eos> Heavy stones fear no weather <eos> I find comfort in the sound <eos> And the shape of the heart <eos> How it echoes through the chest <eos> From under the ground <eos> As the hills turn into holes <eos> I fill them with gold <eos> Heavy stones fear no weather <eos> And from the rain <eos> Comes a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> Illuminate <eos> There's a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> And I paint your body black <eos> I hide in your hair <eos> And you're staring back at me <eos> Like I wasn't there <eos> As our bodies become stills <eos> We welcome the fear <eos> Heavy stones fear no weather <eos> And from the rain <eos> Comes a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> Illuminate <eos> There's a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> And from the rain <eos> Comes a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> Illuminate <eos> There's a river running wild that will create <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> An empire for you <eos> An empire for two <eos> 
You're a part-time lover and a full-time friend <eos> The monkey on your back is the latest trend <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train <eos> I kiss you all starry-eyed, my body's swinging from side to side <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> Here is the church and here is the steeple <eos> We sure are cute for two ugly people <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me <eos> So why can't, you forgive me? <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> I will find my niche in your car <eos> With my MP3 DVD rumble-packed guitar <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> Du du du du du du du du <eos> Du du du du du du du du <eos> Du du du du du du du du du <eos> Up up down down left right left right B A Start <eos> Just because we use cheats doesn't mean we're not smart <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> You are always trying to keep it real <eos> I'm in love with how you feel <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> We both have shiny happy fits of rage <eos> You want more fans, I want more stage <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> Don Quixote was a steel-driving man <eos> My name is Adam, I'm your biggest fan <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> Squinched-up your face and did a dance <eos> You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants <eos> I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else <eos> But you <eos> Du du du du du du du du <eos> Du du du du du du du du <eos> Du du du du du du du du du <eos> But you <eos> 
Did you miss me? <eos> Did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Take a second <eos> To comprehend this <eos> Air it out like dark matter <eos> Preach about the new meta <eos> All the things that we did, that we said, it was all in my head <eos> Will it ever get better? <eos> So tell me, do you like the taste? <eos> Do you like the taste? Lost in this head space <eos> It’s on loop like everyday <eos> Call me your saving grace <eos> Killing time with the band, understand it was all in our heads <eos> It’ll only get better <eos> So tell me - did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Twisted perceptions, weaved into new dimensions <eos> Like a brotherhood I knew that we’d pull through <eos> You’ve all been branded by the four three two crew <eos> Go <eos> Did I lose my mind? <eos> Fell out of orbit like a satellite <eos> Came crashing down without a sound <eos> But I’ll still light up the night sky <eos> One last time <eos> Can you save me? Can you save me? <eos> Or I’ll hit the ground <eos> Fell out of orbit right before it all came crashing down <eos> Did you miss me when I weren’t around? <eos> Did I lose my mind? <eos> Fell out of orbit like a satellite <eos> Came crashing down without a sound <eos> But I’ll still light up the night sky <eos> One last time <eos> One last time <eos> 
I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall <eos> And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call <eos> It's just another call from home <eos> And you'll get it and be gone <eos> And I'll be crying <eos> And I'll be begging you, baby <eos> Beg you not to leave <eos> But I'll be left here waiting <eos> With my heart on my sleeve <eos> Oh, for the next time we'll be here <eos> Seems like a million years <eos> And I think I'm dying <eos> What do I have to do to make you see <eos> She can't love you like me? <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> You keep telling me, baby <eos> There will come a time <eos> When you will leave her arms <eos> And forever be in mine <eos> But I don't think that's the truth <eos> And I don't like being used and I'm tired of waiting <eos> It's too much pain to have to bear <eos> To love a man you have to share <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm down on my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> Don't I give you what you need? <eos> When she calls you to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> We don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay? <eos> I can't take it any longer <eos> But my will is getting stronger <eos> And I think I know just what I have to do <eos> I can't waste another minute <eos> After all that I've put in it <eos> I've given you my best <eos> Why does she get the best of you <eos> So next time you find you wanna leave her bed for mine <eos> Why don't you stay? <eos> I'm up off my knees <eos> I'm so tired of being lonely <eos> You can't give me what I need <eos> When she begs you not to go <eos> There is one thing you should know <eos> I don't have to live this way <eos> Baby, why don't you stay, yeah? <eos> 
I used to go out to parties, and stand around <eos> 'Cause I was too nervous, to really get down <eos> But my body yearned to be free <eos> I got up on the floor, somebody could choose me <eos> No more standin' there beside the walls <eos> Finally got myself together, baby, and I'm havin' a ball <eos> Long as you're groovin', there's always a chance <eos> Somebody watchin' might wanna make romance <eos> Move your body, ooh baby, you dance all night <eos> To the groove and feel alright <eos> Everybody's groovin' on like a fool <eos> But if you see me, spread out and let me in <eos> Baby, just party high and low <eos> Let me step into your erotic zone <eos> Move it up, turn it 'round <eos> Ooo, shake it down <eos> Oww, you can love me when you want to, babe <eos> This is such a groovy party, baby <eos> We're here face to face, everybody's swingin' <eos> This is such a groovy place <eos> All the young ladies are so fine <eos> You're movin' your body easy with no doubts <eos> I know what you thinkin', baby, you want to turn me out <eos> I think I'm gonna let you do it, babe <eos> Keep on dancin' <eos> Got to give it up <eos> Keep on dancin' <eos> Got to give it up <eos> Keep on dancin' <eos> Got to give it up <eos> Keep on dancin' <eos> Got to give it up <eos> Keep on dancin' <eos> Got to give it up... <eos> 
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man <eos> You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me <eos> The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say <eos> I don't share your greed, the only card I need is <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil <eos> Going with the flow, it's all a game to me <eos> Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you <eos> Double up or quit, double stake or split <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools <eos> But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever <eos> And don't forget the joker! <eos> Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me <eos> Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again <eos> I see it in your eyes, take one look and die <eos> The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> 
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Now if there's a smile on my face <eos> It's only there tryin’ to fool the public <eos> But when it comes down to foolin’ you <eos> Now, honey, that's quite a different subject <eos> But don't let my glad expression <eos> Give you the wrong impression <eos> Really I'm sad (Sad, sad, sad, sad) <eos> Oh sadder than sad (I'm hurt so bad) <eos> You're gone, and I'm hurtin' so bad (I pretend to be glad) <eos> Like a clown, I pretend to be glad (Sad, sad, sad, sad) <eos> Now there's some sad things known to man <eos> But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah, baby <eos> Now if I appear to be carefree <eos> It's only to camouflage my sadness <eos> In order to shield my pride, I’ve tried <eos> To cover this hurt with a show of gladness <eos> But don't let my show convince you <eos> That I've been happy since you <eos> Decided to go (Why did you go?) <eos> Oh I need you so (I need you so) <eos> I'm hurt and I want you to know (Want you to know) <eos> But for others I put on a show (It's just a show) <eos> Ooh oh <eos> There's some sad things known to man <eos> But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Just like Pagliacci did (The great pretender) <eos> I try to keep my sadness hid <eos> Smiling in the public eye (The great pretender) <eos> But in my lonely room I cry the tears of a clown <eos> When there's no one around <eos> Oh yeah, baby <eos> Now if there's a smile on my face (Tears of clown) <eos> Don't let my glad expression (Tears of a clown) <eos> Give you the wrong impression <eos> Don't let this smile I wear (Tears of a clown) <eos> Make you think that I don't care <eos> When really I'm sad (Tears of a clown) <eos> Hurtin’ so bad <eos> Cryin’... <eos>

Hasta que me olvides, voy a intentarlo <eos> No habrá quien me seque tus labios por dentro y por fuera <eos> No habrá quien desnude mi nombre una tarde cualquiera <eos> Hasta que me olvides tanto que <eos> No exista mañana ni después <eos> No, no <eos> Hasta que me olvides, voy a intentarlo <eos> No habrá quien desnude mi boca como tu sonrisa <eos> Y voy a rodar como lágrima entre la llovizna <eos> Hasta que me olvides tanto que <eos> No exista mañana ni después <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Voy a amarte tanto, tanto <eos> Como fuego entre tus brazos <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Y me rompa en mil pedazos <eos> Continuar mi gran teatro <eos> Hasta que me olvides, hasta que me olvides <eos> Hoy voy a bordar tu sueño en la almohada <eos> Llenar poco a poco el silencio con tu abecedario <eos> Y cuando me calle por dentro tenerte a mi lado <eos> Hasta que me olvides tanto que <eos> No exista mañana ni después <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Voy a amarte tanto, tanto <eos> Como fuego entre tus brazos <eos> Hasta que me olvides, hasta que me olvides <eos> Y me rompa en mil pedazos <eos> Continuar mi gran teatro <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Voy a continuar copiando <eos> Tu cuerpo sobre la pared <eos> Y voy a colgar en tu pecho <eos> La noche y el amanecer <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Voy amarte tanto, tanto <eos> Como fuego entre tus brazos <eos> Hasta que me olvides, hasta que me olvides <eos> Y me rompa en mil pedazos <eos> Continuar mi gran teatro <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> Hasta que me olvides <eos> 
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans <eos> Way back up in the woods among the evergreens <eos> There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood <eos> Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode <eos> Who never ever learned to read or write so well <eos> But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack <eos> Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track <eos> Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade <eos> Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made <eos> People passing by they would stop and say <eos> Oh my, but that little country boy could play <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> His mother told him "Someday you will be a man <eos> And you will be the leader of a big old band <eos> Many people coming from miles around <eos> To hear you play your music when the sun go down <eos> Maybe someday your name will be in lights <eos> Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'" <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go <eos> Go go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Go, Johnny B. Goode <eos>

When dreaming I'm guided to another world <eos> Time and time again <eos> At sunrise I fight to stay asleep <eos> Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place <eos> Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape <eos> From the life I live when I'm awake <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Although I would like our world to change <eos> It helps me to appreciate <eos> Those nights and those dreams <eos> But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights <eos> If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same <eos> The only difference is <eos> To let love replace all our hate <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> 
I wanted space, not destruction <eos> I wanted a river, not the ocean <eos> 'Cause when I break it down, down to nothing <eos> I know I want and who I am <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> I wanna be a rock, not an island <eos> I wanna be the answer, not the problem <eos> Seven sins a stolen glance, the big reveal, a second chance <eos> Trusted friend, a life unchained, forgiveness for mistakes we've made <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, let you love shine in now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, come on, let your light now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Yeah) <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> 
Oh, my man <eos> I hope your heart <eos> Won't pretend <eos> You ain't that hard <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> No, I never did <eos> Oh, my man <eos> I hoped your heart <eos> Won't pretend <eos> You ain't that far <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore, anymore <eos> Oh, my friend <eos> I hope you're here <eos> Oh, pretend <eos> You ain't that near <eos> And, oh, I don't love you <eos> Anymore <eos> And, oh (Oh) , I don't love you <eos> Anymore (Oh) <eos> You and me <eos> We fail to see <eos> (And, oh) <eos> Deep in my eyes <eos> We fail to fly <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides were beautiful <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides, were beautiful <eos> The autopsy report read <eos> The insides, that's what's beautiful <eos> Insides were beautiful <eos> Insides, that's what's beautiful <eos> We're inside, it's beautiful <eos> 
Standing tall feeling small horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb the mountain to breathe it <eos> You've spoken yet words fail us again <eos> Love language, language limits <eos> Sparkling twilight heart exploding horizons <eos> Flowering dreamscape slow descending I breathe in <eos> You give, you give yet words fail us again <eos> Love language lost in modern lives <eos> Mountains whisper, whisper, whisper <eos> Mountains whisper, mountains whisper <eos> Every word in all of history a million years of toil and folly <eos> None move more than mountains whispers you breathe in me <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb mountain to breathe in <eos> Though we dance we'll separate like oil and water <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> 
Well you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> Staring at the bottom of your glass <eos> Hoping one day you'll make a dream last <eos> But dreams come slow and they go so fast <eos> You see her when you close your eyes <eos> Maybe one day you'll understand why <eos> Everything you touch surely dies <eos> But you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Staring at the ceiling in the dark <eos> Same old empty feeling in your heart <eos> 'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast <eos> Well you see her when you fall asleep <eos> But never to touch and never to keep <eos> 'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep <eos> Well you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh <eos> And you let her go <eos> Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh <eos> When you let her go <eos> Whoa <eos> 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> 'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low <eos> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> Only know you've been high when you're feeling low <eos> Only hate the road when you're missing home <eos> Only know you love her when you let her go <eos> And you let her go... <eos> 
She can kill with a smile <eos> She can wound with her eyes <eos> And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies <eos> And she only reveals <eos> What she wants you to see <eos> She hides like a child <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> She can lead you to love <eos> She can take you or leave you <eos> She can ask for the truth <eos> But she'll never believe you <eos> And she'll take what you give her <eos> As long as it's free <eos> Yeah, she steals like a thief <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> And she'll promise you more <eos> Than the Garden of Eden <eos> Then she'll carelessly cut you <eos> And laugh while you're bleedin' <eos> But she'll bring out the best <eos> And the worst you can be <eos> Blame it all on yourself <eos> Cause she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mmm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> She is frequently kind <eos> And she's suddenly cruel <eos> She can do as she pleases <eos> She's nobody's fool <eos> But she can't be convicted <eos> She's earned her degree <eos> And the most she will do <eos> Is throw shadows at you <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mm, mmm mm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm <eos> 
If you don't wanna see me, mm <eos> Did a full one-eighty <eos> Crazy, thinking 'bout the way I was <eos> Did the heartbreak change me? <eos> Maybe, but look at where I ended up <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not where you left me at all <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, yeah <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Aren't you the guy who tried to hurt me with the word "goodbye" <eos> Though it took some time to survive you <eos> I'm better on the othеr side <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not whеre you left me at all <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, yeah <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away, walk away, oh <eos> Don't start caring about me <eos> Walk away, walk away, oh <eos> So if you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody, oh <eos> If you wanna believe that anything can stop me <eos> Don't show up <eos> Don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away <eos> You know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> 
Got a piece of my mind, to tell you who's mine <eos> Nobody hurts like me for you. <eos> Soft slacks at night, I'm wearing 'em tight <eos> Nobody hurts like I do. <eos> Your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine <eos> So stop feeding me, 'a little more time' <eos> Your shit's a mess, I'm not yours to undress <eos> I'm leaving this love for the last time. <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine. <eos> You've got the means to caress, but weak you leave me a mess <eos> One touch is enough, your hands, a little too rough <eos> Will I ever be enough? <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> We fall the fader to black, release the ropes and feel the slack <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I tell you every time, you're walking a fine, fine line <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I'm not yours <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> 
When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> When I wake each morning <eos> As the storm beats down on me <eos> And I know we belong together <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When we touch each other <eos> In a state of ecstasy <eos> Want this night to last forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos> When I hold you baby <eos> Feel your heartbeat close to me <eos> Want to stay in your arms forever <eos> Only love can set you free <eos> Set you free <eos>

Yeah <eos> Uh <eos> Wooh <eos> Huh <eos> I had a friend was a big baseball player <eos> Back in high school <eos> He could throw that speedball by you <eos> Make you look like a fool boy <eos> Saw him the other night at this roadside bar <eos> I was walking in, he was walking out <eos> We went back inside sat down had a few drinks <eos> But all he kept talking about was <eos> Glory days, well they'll pass you by <eos> Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye <eos> Glory days, glory days <eos> Well there's a girl that lives up the block <eos> Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads <eos> Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by <eos> And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed <eos> Her and her husband Bobby well they split up <eos> I guess it's two years gone by now <eos> We just sit around talking about the old times <eos> She says when she feels like crying <eos> She starts laughing thinking bout <eos> Glory days, well they'll pass you by <eos> Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye <eos> Glory days, glory days <eos> My old man worked 20 years on the line <eos> And they let him go <eos> Now everywhere he goes out looking for work <eos> They just tell him that he's too old <eos> I was 9 nine years old and he was working at the <eos> Metuchen Ford plant assembly line <eos> Now he just sits on a stool down at the Legion hall <eos> But I can tell what's on his mind <eos> Glory days yeah goin back <eos> Glory days aw he ain't never had <eos> Glory days, glory days <eos> In fact I think I'm going down to the well tonight <eos> And I'm gonna drink till I get my fill <eos> And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it <eos> But I probably will <eos> Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture <eos> A little of the glory yeah <eos> Well time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister, but <eos> Boring stories of <eos> Glory days, well they'll pass you by <eos> Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye <eos> Glory days, glory days <eos> 
Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos> 
If there was a single day I could live <eos> A single breath I could take <eos> I'd trade all the others away <eos> The blood's on the wall, so you might as well just admit it <eos> And bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it <eos> You're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this <eos> Smother another failure, lay this to rest <eos> Console yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck <eos> Absorb yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself <eos> I'll chain you to the truth, for the truth shall set you free <eos> I'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty <eos> I'll make all your dreams come to life, then slay them as quickly as they came <eos> Smother another failure, lay this to rest <eos> Console yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck <eos> Absorb yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> Failure! <eos> If there was a day I could live <eos> If there was a single breath I could take <eos> I'd trade all the others away <eos> I'd trade all the others away! <eos> 
Çocuktum masum hayallerim vardı <eos> Mesela her çocuk gibi futbolcu olmak <eos> Mahalle aralarında top yuvarlardık <eos> Cam kırardık, çok can sıkardık <eos> Çocuktum masum oyunlar oynardık <eos> Mesela külah atardık Ermeni'ye <eos> Boncuklu tabancalarımız vardı, mermi değil <eos> Doğal olarak eşit görüyorduk her bireyi <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk. Ne bilelim ayrım gayrım <eos> Bir çocuğun bilmediği tek şey ayrılmaydı <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk be amına koyayım, en azından <eos> Masum olmak gerektiğinin farkındaydık <eos> Nasıl bir çocukmuşuz yetişkinden öte <eos> Bizim tek derdimiz saklambaç oynarken bir sote! <eos> Velhasıl kelam <eos> Çocukken sual şimdi insan olmak ödev <eos> Çocuktum sen bilir misin bir futbolcu kartının <eos> Küçük bir çocuk için ne ifade ettiğini? <eos> Sek sek mermerinin bozuk bir asfaltta, saniyede kaç ivmeyle kaç defa sektiğini? <eos> Bilir misin karanlık bir köşe başında, ilk dumanı ciğerlerime 10 yaşımda çektiğimi? <eos> Nerden bile bilirdim mahalledeki abilerin ruh ve beden sağlığına nifak tohumu ektiğini! <eos> Ey gidi Trabzon! <eos> Boztepe'nin manzarasını inan hayal edemezdi Picasso <eos> 14 yaşındaydım, küçük bir arka mahalleden koca bir metropole geçiş yapmak biraz zordu <eos> Be İstanbul şiir gibisin de okumak ne mümkün! <eos> Ne hengamesi, ne malı, ne mülkü! <eos> Bu şehir milyonlarca insan içinde, yalnızlığın bestelendiği, enstrümanı kalabalığın sesi olan bir türkü! <eos>

Something's going on with me <eos> I'm not who I used to be, no <eos> Reach the point where darkness is my comfort zone <eos> I know it's not what you came here for <eos> So, fly, like an eagle <eos> Go be beautiful and free, girl <eos> 'Cause I'm better off on my own <eos> Go save your soul <eos> You don't wanna go where I go <eos> I'm just a low down rolling stone <eos> Barely hanging on <eos> I'm just a low down rolling stone, huh <eos> I'm barely hanging on, so <eos> Who's help me ease my mind? <eos> Who's help me ease my mind? <eos> Temptation's got a hold of me <eos> I'm not where I'm supposed to be <eos> You're only here for the thrill, it's not where you belong <eos> I know, I'm no one you can depend on <eos> So, fly, like an eagle <eos> Go be beautiful and free girl <eos> 'Cause I'm better off on my own <eos> Go save your soul <eos> You don't wanna go where I go <eos> I'm just a low down rolling stone <eos> I'm better off on my own <eos> Go save your soul <eos> You don't wanna go where I go <eos> I'm just a low down rolling stone <eos> Barely hanging on <eos> There you go, in the clouds again <eos> There you go, in the clouds again <eos> There you go, making rounds again <eos> And I'm only gonna bring you down, so <eos> I'm better off on my own <eos> Go save your soul <eos> You don't wanna go where I go <eos> I'm just a low down rolling stone <eos> Oh, round <eos> You don't wanna go where I go, baby, no <eos>

Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie <eos> We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt <eos> We got a little crazy but we never got caught <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Aw haw <eos> Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy <eos> I was willin' but she wasn't ready <eos> So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone <eos> I dropped her off early but I didn't go home <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Well way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie <eos> We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt <eos> We got a little crazy but we never got caught <eos> Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy <eos> I was willin' but she wasn't ready <eos> So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone <eos> I dropped her off early but I didn't go home <eos> Down by the river on a Friday night <eos> A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight <eos> Talkin' about cars and dreamin' about women <eos> Never had a plan just a living for the minute <eos> Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee <eos> Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me <eos> But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> A lot about livin' and a little about love <eos> Yeah-eee <eos> That's right <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
I never felt magic crazy as this <eos> I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea <eos> I never held emotion in the palm of my hand <eos> Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree <eos> But now you're here <eos> Brighten my northern sky <eos> I've been a long time that I'm waiting <eos> Been a long time that I'm blown <eos> I've been a long time that I've wandered <eos> Through the people I have known <eos> Oh, if you would and you could <eos> Straighten my new mind's eye <eos> Would you love me for my money? <eos> Would you love me for my head? <eos> Would you love me through the winter? <eos> Would you love me 'til I'm dead? <eos> Oh, if you would and you could <eos> Come blow your horn on high <eos> I never felt magic crazy as this <eos> I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea <eos> I never held emotion in the palm of my hand <eos> Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree <eos> But now you're here <eos> Brighten my northern sky <eos> 
Yeah, yeah <eos> I don't remember much about last night <eos> Woke up on a couch sun-rise <eos> Saw the living room <eos> Through these bloodshot eyes of mine, cold sober <eos> You didn’t like that I came home late <eos> 4 AM but it's a Friday, babe <eos> And I've been working hard <eos> Can't you give me some space 'stead of shouting out, "Oh my God"? <eos> Oh-oh, ooh-yeah <eos> Oh-oh, ooh-yeah <eos> I go out with some new friends <eos> But it just makes me miss you more, more <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many <eos> Come take me home <eos> So now I'm the one that's crying <eos> I didn't wanna call 'cause I didn't wanna fight <eos> I swear that I was trying, yeah <eos> But everybody falls when their head's a little high <eos> And I've never meant to get so out my mind <eos> With you playing cool, just pretending it's fine <eos> Oh, we've been 'round, 'round, 'round this <eos> Too many times before <eos> Oh-oh, ooh yeah <eos> Oh-oh, ooh yeah <eos> I go out with some new friends <eos> But it just makes me miss you more, more <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many <eos> Come take me home <eos> I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no <eos> I guess sometimes I should give more of a damn, a damn, a damn about you <eos> I don't know how lucky, how lucky I am, I am, I am, no <eos> I know we're both stubborn <eos> Push each other's buttons <eos> I'd rather do it with you, but... <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> I spend all my money drinking on my own, yeah <eos> In this bar, just sat here staring at my phone <eos> And I keep second guessing, where did I go wrong? <eos> I know I'm proud <eos> But I've had one too many, come take me home <eos> Come take me home <eos> Yeah, I've had one too many <eos>

Loro non sanno di che parlo <eos> Vestiti sporchi, fra', di fango <eos> Giallo di siga' fra le dita <eos> Io con la siga' camminando <eos> Scusami, ma ci credo tanto <eos> Che posso fare questo salto <eos> E anche se la strada è in salita <eos> Per questo ora mi sto allenando <eos> E buonasera, signore e signori <eos> Fuori gli attori <eos> Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni <eos> Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni <eos> Qui la gente è strana tipo spacciatori <eos> Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori <eos> Mo li prendo a calci 'sti portoni <eos> Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori <eos> Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Io ho scritto pagine e pagine <eos> Ho visto sale, poi lacrime <eos> Questi uomini in macchina <eos> Non scalare le rapide <eos> Scritto sopra una lapide <eos> In casa mia non c'è Dio <eos> Ma se trovi il senso del tempo <eos> Risalirai dal tuo oblio <eos> E non c'è vento che fermi <eos> La naturale potenza <eos> Dal punto giusto di vista <eos> Del vento senti l'ebrezza <eos> Con ali in cera alla schiena <eos> Ricercherò quell'altezza <eos> Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta <eos> Prova a tagliarmi la testa <eos> Perché <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cazzo parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Noi siamo diversi da loro <eos>

The first time <eos> Ever I saw your face <eos> I thought the sun <eos> Rose in your eyes <eos> And the moon and the stars <eos> Were the gifts you gave <eos> To the dark <eos> And the endless skies <eos> The first time <eos> Ever I kissed your mouth <eos> I felt the Earth move in my hand <eos> Like the trembling heart <eos> Of a captive bird <eos> That was there, at my command <eos> My love <eos> And the first time <eos> Ever I laid with you <eos> I felt your heart so close to mine <eos> And I knew our joy <eos> Would fill thе Earth <eos> And last 'til the end of time <eos> My lovе <eos> The first time <eos> Ever I saw your face <eos> Your face <eos> Your face <eos> Your face <eos> 
With a little love, and some tenderness <eos> We'll walk upon the water, we'll rise above the mess <eos> With a little peace, and some harmony <eos> We'll take the world together, we'll take 'em by the hand <eos> 'Cause I've got a hand for you, oh <eos> 'Cause I wanna run away with you <eos> Yesterday, I saw you standing there <eos> Your head was down, your eyes were red, no comb had touched your hair <eos> I said get up, and let me see you smile <eos> We'll take a walk together, walk the road awhile, 'cause <eos> 'Cause I've got a hand for you <eos> (I've got a hand for you) <eos> 'Cause I wanna run away with you <eos> (Won't you let me run with you? Yeah) <eos> (Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand <eos> (Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be <eos> (Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because <eos> I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can <eos> See I was wasted, and I was a-wastin' time <eos> 'Til I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes <eos> Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud <eos> I don't wanna be part of your problems, don't wanna be part of your crowd, no <eos> 'Cause I've got a hand for you <eos> (I've got a hand for you) <eos> 'Cause I wanna away run with you <eos> (Ah, won't you let me run with you?) <eos> (Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand <eos> (Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land <eos> (Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but <eos> I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can, yeah <eos> Oh <eos> Let me run, won't you let me run...  <eos> (Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand <eos> (Hold my hand) I'll take you to a place where you can be <eos> (Hold my hand) Anything you wanna be because <eos> I... oh no-no, no no no <eos> (Hold my hand) Want you to hold my hand <eos> (Hold my hand) I'll take you to the promised land <eos> (Hold my hand) Maybe we can't change the world, but <eos> I wanna love you the best that... the best that I can <eos> Oh <eos> The best that I can <eos> 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Ev'rywhere you go <eos> Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again <eos> With candy canes and silver lanes that glow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in ev'ry store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots <eos> Is the wish of Barney and Ben <eos> Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk <eos> Is the hope of Janice and Jen <eos> Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Ev'rywhere you go <eos> There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well <eos> It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Soon the bells will start <eos> And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing <eos> Right within your heart <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in ev'ry store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> Sure it's Christmas, once a-more <eos> 
I took my love, I took it down <eos> I climbed a mountain <eos> And I turned around <eos> And I saw my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Till the landslide brought me down <eos> Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? <eos> Can the child within my heart <eos> Rise above? <eos> Can I sail through <eos> The changing ocean tides <eos> Can I handle the seasons of my life? <eos> Oooooooh Ooooooooh <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makes you bolder <eos> Even children get older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> Well, I've been afraid of changing <eos> 'Cause I built my life around you <eos> But time makеs you bolder <eos> Even children gеt older <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> And I'm getting older too <eos> So take my love, take it down <eos> Climbed a mountain <eos> And turned around <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> And if you see my reflection <eos> In the snow-covered hills <eos> Well, the landslide will bring you down <eos> The landslide will bring you down <eos>

August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
La escuela nunca me gustó <eos> Aún recuerdo aquellos tiempos de la prepa <eos> Ya traía un billetón <eos> Desmadroso desde morro <eos> Ya ni modo, esta vida me tocó <eos> Y aquí andamos al millón <eos> Bien placoso y malandrón <eos> Tengo rayas en el cuerpo <eos> Que resaltan a dondequiera que voy <eos> El Sur Centro de Los Ángeles es mi casa <eos> Es de donde vengo yo <eos> Un saludo a mis homeboys <eos> Historias tengo de a montón <eos> Para no hacer largo el cuento <eos> Hoy ya no salgo sin la súper y el cuernón <eos> De atentados la he librado, dos tres veces <eos> Pero Dios no me dejó <eos> Y de frente la traición <eos> ¡Ea! <eos> Mi niño es mi bendición <eos> La razón por la cual no tiro la toalla <eos> No importa la situación <eos> Mi amuleto de la suerte es la familia <eos> Siempre han sido mi motor <eos> Los primos brincan en calor <eos> Noches de fiesta en Hollywood <eos> Cuando hay tiempo, nos perdemos con modelos <eos> Por allá en el W <eos> Hay billetes, no escatimo el presupuesto <eos> Puro Benjamín Azul <eos> Bien positivo es la actitud <eos> Para la chamba soy de acción <eos> Bien pendiente de todas las oficinas <eos> Todo está bajo control <eos> Quién diría que algún día <eos> El compa Jessie les iba a salir cabrón <eos> Aquí seguimos, no me voy <eos> 
I know your heart <eos> And I know your downfall <eos> Though we fell apart <eos> It was no one's fault <eos> I've gotta make you remember <eos> How hard it was to let me go <eos> Slow dancing with a stranger <eos> But I found somebody new <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes just like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Back when we started <eos> I was a fighter <eos> I kept my guard up <eos> But I took it down for you <eos> Oh, what a thing to do <eos> What do you tell your friends? <eos> The ones I'll never see again <eos> What are you filling in their heads? <eos> I found another ex <eos> Some temporary settlement <eos> To kiss the heartbreak off my lips <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos>

I had a dream we were riding in a drop top down the block <eos> Taking our time doing whatever we want <eos> You put your hand on top of my hand <eos> And just like Grease, we were summer loving <eos> Had our first kiss and we hit the ground running, ah <eos> You put your hand on top of my hand <eos> No dark side for us <eos> No fights just because <eos> No silence that kills, ah <eos> No, no sleepless nights <eos> Oh, just you and I <eos> I love how love feels <eos> So can we stay in this dream like we are 17? <eos> Making love and getting high, you and me <eos> Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely <eos> Can we stay in this dream like we are 17? <eos> Where we keep goin' nonstop down the block <eos> Sneaking our way into every single club <eos> And I have one too many I think <eos> And this thing we have, we didn't know what was it <eos> We didn't know we could get messed up from it <eos> And all we really wanted was <eos> Ah-ha, babe <eos> No sleepless nights <eos> Oh, just you and I <eos> I miss how that feels <eos> So can we stay in this dream like we are 17? <eos> Making love and getting high, you and me <eos> Where we never get angry or bitter or lonely <eos> Can we stay in this dream like we are 17? <eos> Pin you down, kiss me now <eos> We can go in for another round <eos> Pin you down, come kiss me now <eos> Pin you down, kiss me now <eos> We can go in for another round <eos> Pin you down, come kiss me now <eos> I had a dream that we danced at a crosswalk, down the block <eos> Didn't even care that we made the traffic stop <eos> You put your hand on top of my hand <eos> So can we stay in this dream like we are 17?

Out in the country past the city limits sign <eos> Well there's a honky tonk near the county line <eos> The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down <eos> They got whiskey, women, music, and smoke <eos> It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie <eos> I've got a good job, I work hard for my money <eos> When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin' <eos> I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run <eos> I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way <eos> Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie <eos> Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin' <eos> Oh Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie <eos> Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie <eos> The bartender asks me, says son what'll it be <eos> I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me <eos> The dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July <eos> I see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake <eos> Doin' the boot scootin' boogie <eos> Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin' <eos> Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie <eos> Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie <eos> 
Se você disser que eu desafino amor <eos> Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor <eos> Só privilegiados têm ouvido igual ao seu <eos> Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu <eos> Se você insiste em classificar <eos> Meu comportamento de anti-musical <eos> Eu mesmo mentindo devo argumentar <eos> Que isto é bossa-nova, que isto é muito natural <eos> O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente <eos> É que os desafinados também têm um coração <eos> Fotografei você na minha Roleiflex <eos> Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão <eos> Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor <eos> Que ele é o maior que você pode encontrar, viu <eos> Você com a sua música esqueceu o principal <eos> Que no peito dos desafinados <eos> No fundo do peito bate calado <eos> Que no peito dos desafinados <eos> Também bate um coração <eos>

Yeah, yeah, uh (woo!) <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> That's the way every day goes <eos> Every time we've no control <eos> If the sky is pink and white <eos> If the ground is black and yellow <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Nod my head, don't close my eyes <eos> Halfway on a slow move <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> If you could fly, then you'd feel south <eos> Up north's getting cold soon <eos> The way it is, we're on land <eos> Still I'm someone to hold true <eos> Keep you cool when it's still alive <eos> Won't let you down when it's all ruin <eos> Just the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> In the wake of a hurricane <eos> Dark skin of a summer shade <eos> Nosedive into flood lines <eos> Tall tower of milk crates <eos> It's the same way you showed me <eos> Cannonball off the porch side <eos> Older kids trying off the roof <eos> Just the same way you showed me (You showed) <eos> If you could die and come back to life <eos> Up for air from the swimming pool <eos> You'd kneel down to the dry land <eos> Kiss the Earth that birthed you <eos> Gave you tools just to stay alive <eos> And make it out when the sun is ruined <eos> That's the same way you showed me, showed me <eos> You showed me love <eos> Glory from above <eos> Regard, my dear <eos> It's all downhill from here <eos> Remember life, remember how it was <eos> Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here <eos> Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob <eos> Say what up to Danny <eos> Say what up to life immortality <eos> Bending up my Nikes <eos> Running out the melpomene, nicotine <eos> Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy) <eos> Gimme something sweet <eos> Bitch, I might like immortality <eos> This is life, life immortality <eos> 
There are people in town, man, crazy people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee cola <eos> They believe we are wild, man, they believe we are wild <eos> Just because we don't use any money, and we drink no coffee cola <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> There are people in town, man, weird people in town <eos> Eating bread and butter and honey, and drinking black coffee and cola <eos> Money is what they like most, money is what they like <eos> And people who have plenty of money belong to high society <eos> But if you could go and see how they live <eos> (ashamed ashamed) <eos> Then, you discover how savage they are, so much wilder than we <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> I was told that is to get the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> They keep dreaming of war, man, hate and crime everywhere <eos> That is where they can find the money, that need to buy coffee cola <eos> 
I'm gonna hit the highway and I never look back <eos> 'Cause you're just a memory I wish I never had <eos> When the walls close in it's time to get out <eos> Don't matter what's in front of me, I'll find a way round <eos> It don't matter no more <eos> I got my foot to the floor <eos> Like a bullet from a gun <eos> I was born to run <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> I ain't got nothing to lose 'cause I don't have nothin' <eos> Until I get where I'm going I'm gonna keep runnin' <eos> I might be insane, but I sure ain't scarred <eos> 'Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker and I just don't care <eos> It don't matter no more <eos> I got my foot to the floor <eos> Like a bullet from a gun <eos> I was born to run <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta, breakin' outta, breakin' outta <eos> Breakin' outta hell <eos> 'Cause I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell <eos> 'Cause I'm breakin', breakin' outta hell <eos> Breakin' <eos> Breakin' <eos> OUT <eos> OF <eos> HELL <eos> 
I can see it in your eyes <eos> See it in your face <eos> Bangin' on your chest <eos> Actin' tough, lookin' unfazed <eos> Trippin' over landlines <eos> Cuttin' deep with a dull blade <eos> Running out of unrest <eos> Goin' out of your mind <eos> Lonely days will follow, days will follow <eos> And the gaze that stuck the halls will know your name <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> I can see it with my own eyes <eos> The tracks down your face <eos> It can't be easy tryna unwind <eos> Sleepin' on your daydreams <eos> I'm not tryna role-play <eos> These things can make us take the wheel <eos> These days can break <eos> But I'm gonna take the wheel <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> Bet on the winners <eos> Worst of you's born to lose <eos> Bed with no dinner <eos> The rest of you's born to lose <eos> Better than zero <eos> Worst of you's born to lose <eos> Bet on the winners <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (The aftershock) <eos> 
Why should I have to beg for what is rightfully mine? <eos> While you sit back and wait for a comet to pass you by <eos> And you hold out your hands, in hopes that a future will fall right out of the sky <eos> But you will only find dread, as months turn to years fading out into hindsight <eos> Now I watch as the world unwinds <eos> And I bathe in the moonlight <eos> Where do I go from here? <eos> A roadmap of my passing prime <eos> Full of holes, it erodes, with my soul, and I’m bleeding <eos> I’ve been told that it’s all just prologue <eos> The afterlife is waiting for me <eos> But how do you know? <eos> When my fate has been on hold for so long <eos> I grow old, the window starts to close, and I can’t… <eos> Breathe, breathe in and fulfill your purpose <eos> Reduce the trees to a pile of leaves <eos> Burn them all to ash ’til you’re choking on the answer <eos> Though you may never be… <eos> Free, free from the disease that ails us <eos> Beyond the plague of uncertainty, waits the essence of my new reality <eos> With each and every trial, I learned how to be strong <eos> Endow my spirit with the strength to carry on <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> Knowledge of death brings us life <eos> Aging like a fine wine <eos> Until the well has run dry <eos> Marking the passage of time <eos> Need for expression comes in succession <eos> I’m here to take what is mine <eos> Nothing to hold me back if I don’t feel alive <eos> And now the planets align <eos> Drive all my focus into this moment <eos> Something’s in the water <eos> Just like any monster, it grows, and it grows tenfold <eos> The frozen ocean is brought to a boil <eos> Praying at the altar <eos> Just doesn’t compare to getting your own hands dirty <eos> Reality is a tangible thing <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> This is where I belong <eos> And in my fever dream <eos> Nothing is as it seems <eos> So ever-carefully I will roam <eos> Choices I never made <eos> Outcomes that I can’t change <eos> Let go of shame, and carry on <eos> I still carry the spark <eos> It guides me through the dark <eos> So in the frigid pain, I will roam <eos> With burdens in my arms <eos> I’m dreaming of a star <eos> Feels like a fantasy <eos> I’m not asleep <eos> 
'Cause everyday could be a holiday <eos> The pusher man, he just a call away <eos> And when I call, he gonna come around <eos> And when he comes, we gonna burn it down <eos> And he don't stay here for a long time <eos> But when he comes, we'll have a good time <eos> And we could stay right here all day <eos> And I just wanted to hear them say <eos> Lift me up <eos> Said I just got a brand new bag <eos> Lift me up, now <eos> Yeah, I think I need another drag <eos> Lift me up <eos> Yeah, meet me around the back <eos> Tomorrow comes and we have run dry <eos> I only need to call him one time <eos> It don't take long for him to show <eos> And when he comes you know it's gonna do <eos> And he don't stay here for a long time <eos> But when he comes, we'll have a good time <eos> And we could stay right here all day <eos> And I just wanted to hear them say <eos> Lift me up <eos> Said I just got a brand new bag <eos> Lift me up <eos> Yeah, I think I need another drag <eos> Lift me up <eos> Yeah, meet me around the back <eos> Down, down, lift me up <eos> Down, down, lift me up <eos> Down, down, lift me up <eos> Down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> When I'm down, down, lift me up <eos> I just wanted to hear them say <eos> Lift me up <eos> Lift me up, now <eos> Yeah, I think I need another drag <eos> Lift me up <eos> Yeah, meet me around the back <eos> Lift me up <eos> Lift me up <eos> 
It's knowin' that your door is always open <eos> And your path is free to walk <eos> That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag <eos> Rolled up and stashed behind your couch <eos> And it's knowin' I'm not shackled <eos> By forgotten words and bonds <eos> And the ink stains that have dried upon some line <eos> That keeps you in the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> That keeps you ever gentle on my mind <eos> It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy <eos> Planted on their columns now that bind me <eos> Or something that somebody said because <eos> They thought we fit together walkin' <eos> It's just knowing that the world <eos> Will not be cursing or forgiving <eos> When I walk along some railroad track and find <eos> That you're movin' on the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> And for hours you're just gentle on my mind <eos> Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines <eos> And the junkyards and the highways come between us <eos> And some other woman's cryin' to her mother <eos> 'Cause she turned and I was gone <eos> I still might run in silence <eos> Tears of joy might stain my face <eos> And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind <eos> But not to where I cannot see <eos> You walkin' on the back roads <eos> By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind <eos> I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron <eos> In some train yard <eos> My beard a rustlin' coal pile <eos> And a dirty hat pulled low across my face <eos> Through cupped hands 'round a tin can <eos> I pretend to hold you to my breast and find <eos> That you're waitin' from the back roads <eos> By the rivers of my memory <eos> Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind <eos> 
Well, I'm so above you and it's plain to see <eos> But I came to love you anyway <eos> So you pulled my heart out and I don't mind bleedin' <eos> Any old time you keep me waitin' <eos> Waitin', waitin' <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you <eos> And I shoulda done you just the same <eos> But I came to love you, am I born to bleed? <eos> Any old time you keep me waitin' <eos> Waitin', waitin' <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> Hey <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> I'm a lonely boy, I'm a lonely boy <eos> Oh whoa oh, I got a love that keeps me waitin' <eos> 
Grandma got run over by a reindeer <eos> Walking home from our house Christmas eve <eos> You can say there's no such thing as Santa <eos> Grandma got run over by a reindeer <eos> Walking home from our house Christmas eve <eos> You can say there's no such thing as Santa <eos> But as for me and Grandpa, we believe <eos> She'd been drinkin' too much egg nog <eos> And we'd begged her not to go <eos> But she'd left her medication <eos> So she stumbled out the door into the snow <eos> When they found her Christmas mornin' <eos> At the scene of the attack <eos> There were hoof prints on her forehead <eos> And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back <eos> Grandma got run over by a reindeer <eos> Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve <eos> You can say there's no such thing as Santa <eos> But as for me and Grandpa, we believe <eos> Now were all so proud of Grandpa <eos> He's been takin' this so well <eos> See him in there watchin' football <eos> Drinkin' beer and playin' cards with cousin Belle <eos> It's not Christmas without Grandma <eos> All the family's dressed in black <eos> And we just can't help but wonder <eos> Should we open up her gifts or send them back? <eos> Grandma got run over by a reindeer <eos> Walkin' home from our house Christmas eve <eos> You can say there's no such thing as Santa <eos> But as for me and Grandpa, we believe <eos> Now the goose is on the table <eos> And the pudding made of pig <eos> And a blue and silver candle <eos> That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig <eos> I've warned all my friends and neighbors <eos> Better watch out for yourselves <eos> They should never give a license <eos> To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves <eos> Grandma got run over by a reindeer <eos> Walkin' home from our house, Christmas eve <eos> You can say there's no such thing as Santa <eos> But as for me and Grandpa, we believe! <eos>

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner <eos> Sometimes I feel like my only friend <eos> Is the city I live in, The City of Angels <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion <eos> I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am <eos> She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy <eos> Well, I never worry, now that is a lie <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love, take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there <eos> It's hard to believe that I'm all alone <eos> At least I have her love <eos> The city, she loves me <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah <eos> Love me, I say, yeah yeah <eos> One time <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Is where I drew some blood <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I could not get enough <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Forgot about my love <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I gave my life away, yeah <eos> Yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah <eos> Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah <eos> Here I stay <eos>

Mercy <eos> Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me? <eos> Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning? <eos> Mercy <eos> Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working? <eos> Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning? <eos> Cause it's still burning <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely <eos> Wind up home alone please don't call me <eos> And say you miss me, no <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Woah <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> If you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> If you're gonna take your shot, take it <eos> Take it <eos> Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Mmmh if you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Have mercy <eos> 
In this room I'm sitting by your side <eos> 'Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook <eos> Standing on the edge <eos> Casting lots to set me up before you knock me down <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> You let it go and then you fold <eos> So we stay on the open road <eos> We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all <eos> Driving in your car, miss the stop sign, fall in love, just to get knocked out <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes <eos> Pulled like a punch and burnt like a cigarette? <eos> Forever <eos> 
You say you want to cry <eos> But your tears are dry <eos> When I was that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Now my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos> Still I wonder why <eos> Why he had to die <eos> When I feel that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Still my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos>

Yeah <eos> I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze <eos> I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway <eos> Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase <eos> I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah <eos> I battle with depression, but the question still remains <eos> Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage? <eos> And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase <eos> Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day <eos> And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze <eos> Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace <eos> I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace <eos> How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case? <eos> Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste <eos> Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take <eos> But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage <eos> Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention <eos> I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing <eos> And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine <eos> Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave <eos> I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again <eos> Crashed my car just to feel again <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah <eos> Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh <eos> We're sick and tired of wondering <eos> Praying to a god that you don't believe <eos> You're searching for the truth in the lost and found <eos> So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now? <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> 
Could you whisper in my ear? <eos> The things you wanna feel <eos> I'd give you anything <eos> To feel it comin' <eos> Do you wake up on your own <eos> And wonder where you are? <eos> You live with all your faults <eos> I wanna wake up where you are <eos> I won't say anything at all <eos> So why don't you slide? <eos> Yeah, I'm gonna let it slide <eos> Don't you love the life you killed? <eos> The priest is on the phone <eos> Your father hit the wall <eos> Your ma disowned you <eos> I don't suppose I'll ever know <eos> What it means to be a man <eos> Or something I can just change <eos> I live around it <eos> I wanna wake up where you are <eos> I won't say anything at all <eos> So why don't you slide <eos> Ooh, slide <eos> And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete <eos> Little pieces of the nothing that fall <eos> Oh, May <eos> Put your arms around me <eos> What you feel is what you are <eos> And what you are is beautiful <eos> Oh, May <eos> Do you wanna get married <eos> Or run away? <eos> Ooh, oohoo <eos> And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete <eos> Little pieces of the nothin' that fall <eos> Oh, May <eos> Put your arms around me <eos> What you feel is what you are <eos> And what you are is beautiful <eos> Oh, May <eos> Do you wanna get married <eos> Or run away? <eos> I wanna wake up where you are <eos> And I won't say anything <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> Little pieces of the nothing that fall <eos> Ohh, May <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> Little pieces of the nothing that fall <eos> Ohh ohh, oh May <eos> Yeah, slide between the sheets <eos> Of all them beds you never knew <eos> (Yeah, slide) <eos> Why don't you slide into my room <eos> Just slide into my room <eos> And ah we'll run away <eos> Run away, run away <eos>

It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear <eos> She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair <eos> And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight" <eos> We go to a party and everyone turns to see <eos> This beautiful lady that's walking around with me <eos> And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight" <eos> I feel wonderful because I see <eos> The love light in your eyes <eos> And the wonder of it all <eos> Is that you just don't realize how much I love you <eos> It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head <eos> So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed <eos> And then I tell her, as I turn out the light <eos> I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight <eos> Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight" <eos> 
Well I had to come back wet, for you to believe <eos> Some rain was falling on the garden <eos> And I had to get reborn before I could leave <eos> In case I'm wrong, I beg your pardon <eos> All the days and the years keeping on to achieving <eos> Things you started destroying <eos> You were testing strength I could not give <eos> To see you getting down <eos> The thoughts that bring up disappointment <eos> When is the day that I will die for you? <eos> And well, it's easy to understand if you want to leave <eos> I know how fine it's in your tower <eos> It's a picture of some land you tried to achieve <eos> And in case I'm wrong, I beg your pardon <eos> All those days and the years keeping on to achieving <eos> Things you started destroying <eos> You were testing strength I could not give <eos> To see you getting down <eos> The thoughts bring up disappointment <eos> When is the day that I will die for you? <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> Oh, woo <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to) <eos> 
Comin' back from the country <eos> Full of good food and lousy beer <eos> This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty <eos> At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd <eos> And it's anchors aweigh <eos> Looks like smooth sailin' <eos> But the merest hint of waves could capsize you <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's so easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> The desire for annihilation <eos> Is as common as it is unkind <eos> And it's hard to recognize the situation <eos> When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time <eos> You don't have to be alone to be lonesome <eos> It's easy to forget <eos> The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window <eos> And it's Christmas so no one can fix it <eos> Yeah, it's Christmas <eos> So no one can fix it <eos> 
I saw three ships come sailing in <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> I saw three ships come sailing in <eos> On Christmas Day in the morning <eos> And what was in those ships all three <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day? <eos> And what was in those ships all three <eos> On Christmas Day in the morning? <eos> This piece of Earth that came to me <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> This peace on Earth that came to be <eos> On Christmas Day <eos> And all the bells on Earth shall ring <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> And all the bells on Earth shall ring <eos> On Christmas Day <eos> 
Whenever I'm with him <eos> Something inside <eos> Starts to burnin' <eos> And I'm filled with desire <eos> Could it be a devil in me <eos> Or is this the way love's supposed to be? <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Burnin' in my heart (It's like a heat wave) <eos> I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave) <eos> It's tearin' me apart <eos> Whenever he calls my name <eos> Soft, low, sweet and plain <eos> Right then, right then <eos> I feel that burning flame <eos> Has high blood pressure got a hold on me <eos> Or is this the way love's supposed to be? <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Burnin' in my heart (It's like a heat wave) <eos> I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave) <eos> It's tearin' me apart <eos> Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, heat wave <eos> Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, heat wave <eos> Sometimes I stare in space <eos> Tears all over my face <eos> I can't explain it, don't understand it <eos> I ain't never felt like this before <eos> Now, that funny feeling has me amazed <eos> Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (But it's all right, girl) <eos> Oh (Go ahead, girl) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Well, it's all right, girl) <eos> Oh (Can't miss it, that's love, girl) <eos> I feel it burnin' (Don't pass up this chance) <eos> Right here in my heart (It sounds like a true romance) <eos> Don't you know it's like a heat wave? <eos> Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (Burnin', burnin') <eos> Oh (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> Yeah, don't you know it's like a heat wave? <eos> Burnin' right here (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> In my heart (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> Yeah- yeah, yeah-yeah (Burnin', burnin') <eos> Oh (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos>

An ancient warmth <eos> Under the horizon <eos> Given signs of lights <eos> A solid rising <eos> I knew the void would come to be <eos> I never thought it would complete me <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> Leaves all over me <eos> Buried alive <eos> Flowers of sulfur <eos> A dark future ahead <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> It wasn't always marked by the dark <eos> Once the sun belonged to the stars <eos> The silence surrounded us and <eos> Numbers existed just in minds <eos> In between everything, all, nothing can change <eos> It's such a shame <eos> I missed the rain <eos> That would have taken me far away <eos> A last glance at those lights <eos> I knew I could be moved <eos> I knew that this age was doomed <eos>

Hello, I've waited here for you <eos> Everlong <eos> Tonight, I throw myself into <eos> And out of the red <eos> Out of her head, she sang <eos> Come down, and waste away with me <eos> Down with me <eos> Slow how you wanted it to be <eos> I'm over my head <eos> Out of her head, she sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> When I sing along with you <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> She sang <eos> Breathe out, so I can breathe you in <eos> Hold you in <eos> And now I know you've always been <eos> And out of your head, out of my head I sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> When I sing along with you <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> She sang <eos> And I wonder <eos> If everything could ever feel this real forever <eos> If anything could ever be this good again <eos> The only thing I'll ever ask of you <eos> You've got to promise not to stop when I say when <eos> 
Oh, life is bigger <eos> It's bigger than you, and you are not me <eos> The lengths that I will go to <eos> The distance in your eyes <eos> Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up <eos> That's me in the corner <eos> That's me in the spotlight <eos> Losing my religion <eos> Trying to keep up with you <eos> And I don't know if I can do it <eos> Oh no, I've said too much <eos> I haven't said enough <eos> I thought that I heard you laughing <eos> I thought that I heard you sing <eos> I think I thought I saw you try <eos> Every whisper of every waking hour <eos> I'm choosing my confessions <eos> Trying to keep an eye on you <eos> Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool <eos> Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up <eos> Consider this, consider this <eos> The hint of the century <eos> Consider this the slip <eos> That brought me to my knees, failed <eos> What if all these fantasies <eos> Come flailing around? <eos> And now I've said too much <eos> I thought that I heard you laughing <eos> I thought that I heard you sing <eos> I think I thought I saw you try <eos> But that was just a dream <eos> That was just a dream <eos> That's me in the corner <eos> That's me in the spotlight <eos> Losing my religion <eos> Trying to keep up with you <eos> And I don't know if I can do it <eos> Oh no, I've said too much <eos> I haven't said enough <eos> I thought that I heard you laughing <eos> I thought that I heard you sing <eos> I think I thought I saw you try <eos> But that was just a dream <eos> Try, cry, why try? <eos> That was just a dream, just a dream <eos> Just a dream, dream <eos>

Frosty the snowman <eos> Was a jolly happy soul <eos> With a corncob pipe and a button nose <eos> And two eyes made out of coal <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Is a fairytale they say <eos> He was made of snow <eos> But the children know <eos> How he came to life one day <eos> There must have been some magic <eos> In that old silk hat they found <eos> For when they placed it on his head <eos> He began to dance around <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Was alive as he could be <eos> And the children say <eos> He could laugh and play <eos> Just the same as you and me <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Knew the sun was hot that day <eos> So he said let's run <eos> And we'll have some fun <eos> Now before I melt away <eos> Down to the village <eos> With a broomstick in his hand <eos> Running here and there all around the square <eos> Saying catch me if you can <eos> He led them down the streets of town <eos> Right to the traffic cop <eos> And he only paused a moment when <eos> He heard him holler stop <eos> Frosty the snowman <eos> Had to hurry on his way <eos> But he waved goodbye <eos> Saying don't you cry <eos> I'll be back again some day <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Look at frosty go <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Thumpety thump thump <eos> Over the hills of snow <eos> 
You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> And you ain't no friend of mine <eos> When they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> Yeah, they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> And you ain't no friend of mine <eos> You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> And you ain't no friend of mine <eos> Ahh, ahh <eos> Ahh, ahh <eos> When they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> Yeah, they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> And you ain't no friend of mine <eos> Ahh, ahh <eos> Ahh, ahh <eos> When they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> You know, they said you was high classed <eos> Well, that was just a lie <eos> Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> And you ain't no friend of mine <eos> You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> You ain't nothing but a hound dog <eos> Crying all the time <eos> Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit <eos> You ain't no friend of mine <eos> 
Thought that there was more <eos> So I walked out the door <eos> Set out on the path unwinding <eos> Aimin' for the stars <eos> But I wound up in the dark <eos> Didn't know this road would be so lonely <eos> Where do I go from here? <eos> And what do I have to show for <eos> All of the wasted years? <eos> And I don't think I can take no more <eos> I need to lay these burdens down <eos> I've been wanderin' for too long now <eos> Tired of livin' this life on my own <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> Wanna take a step <eos> Upon the open road <eos> But all I fear is fear and trembling <eos> Turnin' back around <eos> I wanted to be found <eos> But all the questions keep me guessing <eos> Where do I go from here? <eos> And what do I have to show for <eos> All of the wasted years? <eos> And I don't think I can take no more <eos> I need to lay these burdens down <eos> I've been wanderin' for too long now <eos> Tired of livin' this life on my own <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back, come back, come back home <eos> Come back <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> I need to lay these burdens down <eos> I've been wanderin' for too long now <eos> Tired of livin' this life on my own <eos> I'd trade it all just to come back home <eos> 
Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> X2 <eos> We thought about love and that's sweet to me <eos> You say we got time and that speaks to me <eos> Now I'm all caught up <eos> 21 done and that's all my love <eos> Spent time wise, didn't waste too much <eos> Chasing the clouds <eos> Tryin' to rangle 'em down <eos> Now I'm all messed up <eos> You don't come 'round and that's just my luck <eos> I gave you all my love <eos> I thought you were the one <eos> I thought you were the one <eos> Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> Now I'm all washed up <eos> If we gon' drown then that's all my love <eos> Leaking out <eos> But my head's in the clouds <eos> Try to anchor me down <eos> Now I'm all messed up <eos> You don't come round and that's just my luck (luck) <eos> I gave you all my love <eos> Maybe we're just wired this way <eos> We just need to ride this wave <eos> I looked up one day <eos> And the sky was on fire <eos> Now something's running through my mind <eos> Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> X2 <eos> 
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You really are a heel <eos> You’re as cuddly as a cactus <eos> And as charming as an eel <eos> Mr. Grinch <eos> You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel <eos> Just face the music you're a monster, Mr. Grinch <eos> Your heart’s an empty hole <eos> Your brain is full of spiders <eos> You've got garlic in your soul Mr Grinch <eos> I wouldn't touch you with a <eos> Thirty-nine and a half foot pole <eos> You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You've got termites in your smile <eos> You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile <eos> Mr Grinch <eos> Well given the choice between the two of you I would take the the seasick crocodile <eos> You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You're a nasty wasty skunk <eos> Your heart is full of unwashed socks <eos> And your soul is full of gunk <eos> Mr Grinch <eos> The three best words I would use to describe you are as follows and I quote <eos> Stink! Stank! Stunk! <eos>

Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos> 
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
The first thing I remember knowing <eos> Was a lonesome whistle blowing <eos> And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride <eos> On a freight train leaving town <eos> Not knowing where I'm bound <eos> And no one could change my mind but mama tried <eos> One and only rebel child <eos> From a family meek and mild <eos> My mama seemed to know what lay in store <eos> Despite all my Sunday learning <eos> Towards the bad I kept on turning <eos> 'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore <eos> And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole <eos> No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried <eos> Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied <eos> That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried <eos> Dear old daddy, rest his soul <eos> Left my mom a heavy load <eos> She tried so very hard to fill his shoes <eos> Working hours without rest <eos> Wanted me to have the best <eos> She tried to raise me right but I refused <eos> And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole <eos> No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried <eos> Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied <eos> That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried <eos> 
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness <eos> By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages <eos> Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone <eos> And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone <eos> And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels <eos> Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven <eos> To a place I recall, I was there so long ago <eos> The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone, alone <eos> And on I read until the day was gone <eos> And I sat in regret of all the things I've done <eos> For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged <eos> In dreams until my death, I will wander on <eos> In your house, I long to be <eos> Room by room, patiently <eos> I'll wait for you there like a stone <eos> I'll wait for you there alone, alone <eos>

Bésame la boca <eos> Con tu lágrima de risa <eos> Bésame la luna <eos> Y tapa el sol con el pulgar <eos> Bésame el espacio <eos> Entre mi cuerpo y tu silueta <eos> Y al mar más profundo besaré con tu humedad <eos> Bésame el susurro <eos> Que me hiciste en el oído <eos> Besa el recorrido <eos> De mis manos a tu altar <eos> Con agua bendita de tu fuente <eos> Bésame toda la frente <eos> Que me bautiza y me bendice <eos> Esa manera de besar <eos> Besa mis campos y mis flores <eos> Con tus gotitas de colores <eos> Besa la lluvia que resbala la ventana <eos> Besa mi vida y mis cenizas <eos> Y me dirás que voy deprisa <eos> Bésame y deja con un grito <eos> Que lo logre <eos> Besa el torrente de ilusiones <eos> Bésame todas las pasiones <eos> Besa mi río hasta su desembocadura <eos> Besa mi vida y mis cenizas <eos> Y me dirás que voy deprisa <eos> Besa mis días y mis noches <eos> Mis diluvios y mi cielo a pleno sol <eos> Bésame los ojos <eos> Aun dormido en la mañana <eos> Bésame la piel <eos> Con el caudal de tu estreches <eos> Con agua bendita de tu fuente <eos> Bésame toda la frente <eos> Que me bautiza <eos> Y me bendice esa manera de besar <eos> Besa mis campos y mis flores <eos> Con tus gotitas de colores <eos> Besa la lluvia que resbala la ventana <eos> Besa mi vida y mis cenizas <eos> Y me dirás que voy deprisa <eos> Bésame y deja con un grito <eos> Que lo logre <eos> Besa el torrente de ilusiones <eos> Bésame todas las pasiones <eos> Besa mi río hasta su desembocadura <eos> Besa mi vida y mis cenizas <eos> Y me dirás que voy deprisa <eos> Besa mis días y mis noches <eos> Mis diluvios y mi cielo a pleno sol <eos> Y mi cielo a pleno sol <eos> 
Summertime's already half-way through <eos> Some more times what I'd need from you <eos> You got a weekday, you got a weekend <eos> I'd take a minute, I'd take a second <eos> Baby right now <eos> Nothing sounds better than <eos> Lying with you <eos> With nothing to do <eos> Lying with you <eos> Is all I want to do <eos> Yeah <eos> You can take a sit in the front room <eos> Kick your feet up while the wind blows <eos> I'll be right here by your side <eos> If you're there with me <eos> Everything will be alright babe <eos> I know life is crazy <eos> I know, just get lazy <eos> Let your worries dissipate <eos> Spend all day lying with you <eos> (You) <eos> (You) <eos> (You) <eos> (You) <eos> Lying with you <eos> (Lying with you) <eos> With nothing to do <eos> (With nothing to do) <eos> Lying with you <eos> (Lying with you) <eos> Is all I want to do <eos> (Is all I want to do) <eos> 
You would use your songs to say <eos> The words you couldn't say <eos> And every word you sang <eos> Was about you and me <eos> I loved everything you've wrote <eos> And when you would sing <eos> I felt that my heart was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> And with Cristal and pink champagne <eos> On our wedding day <eos> You had a Hollywood sign made of cocaine for us <eos> Then you got on top of it <eos> And you sang to me <eos> As the snow was falling <eos> You're all I want <eos> We fucked so hot it left me faded <eos> For all you are <eos> There is no other love, it's only yours <eos> You're all I want, all the love <eos> 
Good King Wenceslas looked out <eos> On the feast of Stephen <eos> When the snow lay round about <eos> Deep and crisp and even <eos> Brightly shown the moon that night <eos> Though the frost was cruel <eos> When a poor man came in sight <eos> Gathering winter fuel <eos> Hither, page, and stand by me <eos> If thou know it telling: <eos> Yonder peasant, who is he? <eos> Where and what his dwelling? <eos> Sire, he lives a good league hence <eos> Underneath the mountain <eos> Right against the forest fence <eos> By Saint Agnes fountain <eos> Bring me flesh, and bring me wine <eos> Bring me pine logs hither <eos> Thou and I will see him dine <eos> When we bear the thither <eos> Page and monarch, forth they went <eos> Forth they went together <eos> Through the rude wind's wild lament <eos> And the bitter weather <eos> Sire, the night is darker now <eos> And the wind blows stronger <eos> Fails my heart, I know not how <eos> I can go no longer <eos> Ark my footsteps my good page <eos> Tread thou in them boldly: <eos> Thou shalt find the winter's rage <eos> Freeze thy blood less coldly <eos> In his master's step he trod <eos> Where the snow lay dented <eos> Heat was in the very sod <eos> Which the saint had printed <eos> Therefore, Christian men, be sure <eos> Wealth or rank possessing <eos> Ye who now will bless the poor <eos> Shall yourselves find blessing <eos> 
There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of <eos> Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above <eos> Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough <eos> When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love? <eos> Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know? (Love can be deceiving) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know if he really loves me? <eos> I say a prayer with every heart beat <eos> I fall in love whenever we meet <eos> I'm asking you what you know about these things <eos> How will I know if he's thinking of me? <eos> I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak) <eos> Falling in love is so bittersweet <eos> This love is strong, why do I feel weak? <eos> Oh, wake me, I'm shaking <eos> Wish I had you near me now <eos> Said there's no mistakin' <eos> What I feel is really love <eos> Ooh, tell me <eos> How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know? (Love can be deceiving) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know if he really loves me? <eos> I say a prayer with every heart beat <eos> I fall in love whenever we meet <eos> I'm asking you what you know about these things <eos> How will I know if he's thinking of me? <eos> I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak) <eos> Falling in love is so bittersweet <eos> This love is strong, why do I feel weak? <eos> If he loves me <eos> If he loves me not <eos> If he loves me <eos> If he loves me not <eos> If he loves me <eos> If he loves me not <eos> Oh, how will I know? <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know? <eos> Hey, how will I know? <eos> How will I know if he really loves me? <eos> I say a prayer with every heart beat <eos> I fall in love whenever we meet <eos> I'm asking you what you know about these things <eos> How will I know if he's thinking of me? <eos> I try to phone, but I'm too shy (Can't speak) <eos> Falling in love is so bittersweet <eos> This love is strong, why do I feel weak? <eos> How will I know? (How will I know?) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know? (I say a prayer) <eos> How will I know? Ooh <eos> How will I know? (I fall in love) <eos> How will I know? <eos> How will I know? <eos> I'm asking you <eos> 
You may think that I'm talking foolish <eos> You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free <eos> You may wonder how I can promise you now <eos> This love that I feel for you, always will be <eos> But you're not just time that I'm killing <eos> I'm no longer one of those guys <eos> As sure as I live, this love that I give <eos> Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen​ <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> I'll be happy to tell you again <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> They say that time takes its toll on a body <eos> Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey <eos> But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair <eos> And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway <eos> They say that time can play tricks on a memory <eos> Make people forget things they knew <eos> Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me <eos> I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> Well, just listen to how this song ends <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> 
Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know I'm just a flight away <eos> If you want it, you could take a private plane <eos> A kilómetros estamos conectando <eos> Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando <eos> You know I got a lot to say <eos> All these voices in the background of my brain <eos> Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando <eos> Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know that I can see right through you <eos> I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> What you wanna do? <eos> It's written all over your face, times two <eos> 'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> I can hear your thoughts like a melody <eos> Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep <eos> You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe <eos> (On repeat) <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> (You know I got a lot to say) <eos> (All these voices in the background of my brain) <eos>

Feels like we've lived a hundred lives before <eos> Together and then decided on one more <eos> Here on Earth where everything is cruel <eos> 'Cause no one knows that this is just a school <eos> For what it's worth, I'd die with you again <eos> A hundred more times multiplied by ten <eos> I hope I'll always have you in my mind <eos> So that I know to find you every time <eos> Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate <eos> Won't you dance here with me whilе it grows late? <eos> Put your head on my chest, that's your safе place <eos> We'll fall deeper in love every day <eos> From life unto life and for always <eos> I'll be there when you need me around <eos> When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree <eos> Baby, you'll have me <eos> Soul mate <eos> Maybe there's not a brightness in this dark <eos> Other than what is burning in this heart <eos> But if we fight to keep this thing alive <eos> Pretty sure there's no end to us in sight <eos> I'll follow you into whatever is next <eos> Or you can follow me, whatever's best <eos> First, let's dance the dance that lovers do <eos> Before we go to sleep and start anew <eos> Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate <eos> Won't you dance here with me while it grows late? <eos> Put your head on my chest, that's your safe place <eos> We'll fall deeper in love every day <eos> From life unto life and for always <eos> I'll be there when you need me around <eos> When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree <eos> Baby, you'll have me <eos> Soul mate <eos> I promise you that I'll find a way <eos> To give you hope, to keep you close and safe <eos> Keep you close, no matter come what may <eos> And then we'll sleep in endless shades of gray (And then we'll sleep in endless shades of gray) <eos> 
(Verse 1 : ) <eos> I call you <eos> When I need you <eos> My heart's on fire <eos> You come to me <eos> Come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> Oh, you come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> You bring a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> You speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart baby <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Verse 2 : ) <eos> In your heart I see <eos> The start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Bridge : ) <eos> Each time you leave me <eos> I start losing control <eos> You're walking away <eos> With my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel it even when I'm alone <eos> Oh baby, don't let go <eos> (Chorus :) <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Outro :) <eos> You're the best <eos>

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me <eos> And speak, but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see <eos> It aches in every bone <eos> I'll die alone, but not for you <eos> My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing <eos> I know it's me, you fear <eos> If you want me, hold me back <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale <eos> The pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high <eos> Just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away <eos> So come, sit by the fire and play a while <eos> But you can't stay too long <eos> It aches in every bone <eos> I'll die alone, but not for pleasure <eos> I see my heart explode <eos> It's been eroded by the weather here <eos> If you want me, hold me back <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Hold your eyes closed, take me in <eos> Hold your eyes closed, take me in <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail <eos> And so we go back to the remedy <eos> Clip the wings that get you high, just leave 'em where they lie <eos> And tell yourself you'll be the death of me <eos> 
Goin' down like a sunset <eos> Burnin' out like a cigarette <eos> Blowin' through the cash, through the past <eos> Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left <eos> I could go on and on <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> I could drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> Trying to ride out the midnight <eos> Trying to fight through the daylight <eos> Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that <eos> I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos>

Swaying room, as the music starts <eos> Strangers making the most of the dark <eos> Two by two, their bodies become one <eos> I see you through the smokey air <eos> Can't you feel the weight of my stare? <eos> You're so close but still a world away <eos> What I'm dying to say, is that <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> Touch me once and you'll know it's true <eos> I never wanted anyone like this <eos> It's all brand new <eos> You'll feel it in my kiss <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you <eos> Trying hard to control my heart <eos> I walk over to where you are <eos> Eye to eye we need no words at all <eos> Slowly now, we begin to move <eos> Every breath I'm deeper into you <eos> Soon we two are standing still in time <eos> If you read my mind, you'll see <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> Touch me once and you'll know it's true <eos> I never wanted anyone like this <eos> It's all brand new <eos> You'll feel it in my kiss <eos> You'll feel it in my kiss <eos> Because I'm crazy for you <eos> Touch me once and you'll know it's true <eos> I never wanted anyone like this <eos> It's all brand new <eos> You'll feel it in my kiss <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you <eos> It's all brand new <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> And you know it's true <eos> I'm crazy, crazy for you <eos> It's all brand new, I'm crazy for you <eos> And you know it's true <eos> Yeah, I'm crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you, baby <eos> I'm crazy for you <eos> Crazy for you, baby <eos> 
We're in the homestretch of the hard times <eos> We took a hard left, but we're alright <eos> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but <eos> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I <eos> Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried <eos> No, it don't always go the way we planned it <eos> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> When the bones are good <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter) <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah) <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain) <eos> 'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo) <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo) <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Yeah, ooh <eos> 
Are we ready?... We- We can keep that one, right? <eos> Ready? <eos> One... two... <eos> One, two, three... <eos> Let's just forget everything said <eos> And everything we did <eos> Best friends and better halves <eos> Goodbyes <eos> And the autumn night when we realized <eos> We were falling out of love <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said that weren't meant <eos> There were some things that were said <eos> But we never did <eos> Not to be overly (Overly) <eos> Dramatic <eos> I just think it's best <eos> 'Cause you can't miss what you forget <eos> So, let's just pretend <eos> Everything and anything <eos> Between you and me <eos> Was never meant <eos> Was never meant <eos> 
Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul <eos> He said I'm there before my time <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> I'm running out of reasons to start up a conversation with you <eos> Usually, I'd be the first to run to your defense <eos> But this time, I can't even come up with an excuse <eos> Tengo que vivir un día a la vez, poco a poco <eos> Otherwise, I'd lose my head <eos> And I'd start doubting everything that I believe in <eos> Believe me (No, no, no, no) <eos> Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul (Old soul) <eos> He said I'm there before my time (Time) <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> You push me to a side, why do I wait <eos> For you to come around and talk again? <eos> Mess with my mind, I'll move myself out of your way <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> I'd just rather not confront them because then they bring us problems <eos> And they're always in the back of my head <eos> Are you bored yet? Are you leaving? <eos> It's kinda shifted, I feel the difference <eos> Don't want attachment to you, no <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> Just yet, mm <eos> 
In my solitude you haunt me <eos> With reveries of days gone by <eos> In my solitude you taunt me <eos> With memories that never die <eos> I sit in my chair <eos> Filled with despair <eos> Nobody could be so sad <eos> With gloom ev'rywhere <eos> I sit and I stare <eos> I know that I'll soon go mad <eos> In my solitude <eos> I'm praying <eos> Dear Lord above <eos> Send back my love <eos> 
You don't understand, I'm not ever like this <eos> I can hold my breath, say "I'll be alright" <eos> But kinda hard to think <eos> When I can't feel a thing <eos> Tell me to my face already heard it last week <eos> Driving me insane, it's hitting real badly <eos> Tell me, what's her name?

The cycle repeated <eos> As explosions broke in the sky <eos> All that I needed <eos> Was the one thing I couldn't find <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> The colors conflicted <eos> As the flames climbed into the clouds <eos> I wanted to fix this <eos> But couldn't stop from tearing it down <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Caught in the burning glow <eos> And I was there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let you know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> You told me yes, you held me high <eos> And I believed when you told that lie <eos> I played soldier, you played king <eos> And struck me down when I kissed that ring <eos> You lost that right to hold that crown <eos> I built you up but you let me down <eos> So when you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos>

We fight, we get high holdin' on to love <eos> We came down 'cause there was nothing holdin' us <eos> Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are? <eos> Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart? <eos> Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go? <eos> Are your tears falling down when the lights are low? <eos> Another Friday night tryna put on a show <eos> Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'? <eos> I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin <eos> So, darlin' <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin' <eos> I look around as my heart is collapsin' <eos> 'Cause you're the only one I need <eos> To put a little love on me <eos> We wrote and we wrote <eos> 'Til there were no more words <eos> We laughed and we cried <eos> Until we saw our worst <eos> Is it wrong that I still wonder where you are? <eos> Is it wrong that I still don't know my heart? <eos> Are you all dressed up but with nowhere to go? <eos> Are your tears falling down when the lights are low? <eos> Another Friday night tryna put on a show <eos> Do you hate the weekend 'cause nobody's callin'? <eos> I've still got so much love hidden beneath this skin <eos> Will someone <eos> Put a little love on me? Ayy <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up and there's no shadows dancin' <eos> I look around as my heart is collapsin' <eos> 'Cause you're the only one I need <eos> To put a little love on me <eos> Last night I lay awake <eos> Stuck on the things we say <eos> And when I close my eyes <eos> The first thing I hear you say is <eos> Put a little love on me, ayy <eos> Put a little love on me <eos> When the lights come up we're the only ones dancing <eos> I look around and you're standing there asking <eos> You say, "You're the only one I need <eos> So put your love on me" <eos> You're the only one I need <eos> Put your love on me <eos> 
Every little bit hurts <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> Every night I cry <eos> Every night I sigh <eos> Every night I wonder why <eos> You treat me cold <eos> Yet you won't let me go <eos> Every little hurt counts <eos> Every little hurt counts <eos> You say you're coming home <eos> Yet you never phone <eos> Leave me all alone <eos> My love is strong for you <eos> I'd do wrong for you <eos> I can't take this <eos> Loneliness you've given me <eos> I can't go on <eos> Giving my life away <eos> Oh, come back to me <eos> Darling, you'll see <eos> I can give you all the <eos> Things that you wanted before <eos> If you will stay with me, yeah <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> To you, I'm a toy <eos> And you're the boy <eos> Who has to say <eos> When I should play <eos> Yet you hurt me, desert me <eos> Come back to me <eos> Darling, you'll see <eos> I can give you all the <eos> Things that you wanted before <eos> If you will stay with me, yeah <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> Every little bit hurts <eos> 
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance <eos> They're looking for a little romance <eos> Given half a chance <eos> And I have never seen that dress you're wearing <eos> Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes <eos> I have been blind <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> But I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> You were amazing <eos> I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side <eos> And when you turned to me and smiled <eos> It took my breath away <eos> And I have never had such a feeling <eos> Such a feeling of complete and utter love <eos> As I do tonight <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> Well, I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I never will forget the way you look tonight <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> My lady in red <eos> I love you <eos>

The tree of life my soul hath seen <eos> Laden with fruit, and always green: <eos> The trees of nature fruitless be <eos> Compared with Christ the apple tree <eos> His beauty doth all things excel: <eos> By faith I know, but ne'er can tell <eos> The glory which I now can see <eos> In Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> For happiness I long have sought <eos> And pleasure dearly I have bought: <eos> I missed of all; but now I see <eos> 'Tis found in Christ the apple tree <eos> I'm weary with my former toil <eos> Here I will sit and rest awhile: <eos> Under the shadow I will be <eos> Of Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> This fruit doth make my soul to thrive <eos> It keeps my dying faith alive; <eos> Which makes my soul in haste to be <eos> With Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos>

Peace is not a silent state <eos> That comes upon us from within— <eos> Serene, detached, oblivious <eos> Peace is not a force like rain <eos> That comes, unbidden, from above— <eos> Gentle, enfolding, natural <eos> Peace is fire! Yes, peace is fire! <eos> And peace is passion! <eos> Peace requires a strength of will <eos> A certain courage, a heart of iron <eos> A force abiding to fulfill <eos> Peace is not a foregone fate; <eos> For peace, like war, must be waged— <eos> Mindfully, deliberately <eos> With arms ever ready <eos> And eyes wide open <eos>

"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos>

You're going home <eos> What do I do with the void in your shape <eos> Leaving me frailty, a drop and I break <eos> What do I do with half of myself? <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I could be loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go?

I bet you're wondering how I knew <eos> 'Bout your plans to make me blue <eos> With some other guy you knew before <eos> Between the two of us guys <eos> You know I love you more <eos> It took me by surprise, I must say <eos> When I found out yesterday <eos> Don't you know that <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> I know a man ain't supposed to cry <eos> But these tears I can't hold inside <eos> Losing you would end my life you see <eos> Because you mean that much to me <eos> You could have told me yourself <eos> That you love someone else <eos> Instead <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> And I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> People say "believe half of what you see <eos> Son and none of what you hear" <eos> But I can't help being confused <eos> If it's true please tell me dear: <eos> Do you plan to let me go <eos> For the other guy you loved before? <eos> Don't you know <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine, baby <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos>

Knew the signs, wasn't right <eos> I was stupid for a while <eos> Swept away by you <eos> And now I feel like a fool <eos> So confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> Catch myself from despair <eos> I could drown if I stay here <eos> Keeping busy every day <eos> I know I will be okay <eos> But I was so confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> So much hurt, so much pain <eos> Takes a while to regain <eos> What is lost inside <eos> And I hope that, in time <eos> You'll be out of my mind <eos> And I'll be over you <eos> But now I'm so confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> You never gave your heart <eos> In my reach, I can see <eos> There's a life out there for me <eos>

You load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> (Spoken) <eos> Yes, sir, there's many a Kentucky coal miner that pretty nearly owes his soul to the company store. He gets so far in debt to the coal company he's a-workin' for that he goes on sometimes for years without bein' paid one red cent in real, honest-to-goodness money. But he can always go to the company store and draw flickers or scrip. You know, that's little brass coins that you can't spend nowhere, only at the company store. So they add that against his account. And every day, he gets a little farther in debt. Sounds pretty bad, but even that's got a brighter side to it <eos> Now some people say a man's made out of mud <eos> But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood <eos> Muscle and blood, skin and bones <eos> A mind that's weak and a back that's strong <eos> You load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> Well, I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine <eos> I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mines <eos> Loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal <eos> And the straw boss a-hollered "Well, bless my soul!" <eos> Sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain <eos> Fightin' and trouble is my middle name <eos> I was raised in the bottoms by a mama hound <eos> I'm mean as a dog, but I'm gentle as a lamb <eos> I load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> Well, if you see me comin', you better step aside <eos> A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died <eos> I got a fist of iron and a fist of steel <eos> If the right one don't get you, then the left one will <eos> You load sixteen tons, and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> 
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean <eos> She was the best damn woman that I ever seen <eos> She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies <eos> Knocking me out with those American thighs <eos> Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air <eos> She told me to come, but I was already there <eos> 'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking <eos> My mind was aching, and we were making it <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> Working double-time on the seduction line <eos> She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine <eos> Wanted no applause, just another course <eos> Made a meal outta me, and come back for more <eos> Had to cool me down to take another round <eos> Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing <eos> That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking <eos> My mind was aching, and we were making it <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> It knocked me out that <eos> You shook me all night long <eos> It had me shaking <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> Well, you took me <eos> You really took me and <eos> You shook me all night long <eos> Ah, you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> You really got me and you, shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> All night long <eos> 
Well, I was born in a small town <eos> And I live in a small town <eos> Probably die in a small town <eos> Oh, those small communities <eos> All my friends are so small town <eos> My parents live in the same small town <eos> My job is so small town <eos> Provides little opportunity <eos> Educated in a small town <eos> Taught to fear Jesus in a small town <eos> Used to daydream in that small town <eos> Another boring romantic, that's me <eos> But I've seen it all in a small town <eos> Had myself a ball in a small town <eos> Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town <eos> Now she's small town just like me <eos> No, I cannot forget from where it is that I come from <eos> I cannot forget the people who love me <eos> Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town <eos> And people let me be just what I want to be <eos> Got nothing against a big town <eos> Still hayseed enough to say, "look who's in the big town" <eos> But my bed is in a small town <eos> Oh, and that's good enough for me <eos> Well, I was born in a small town <eos> And I can breathe in a small town <eos> Gonna die in this small town <eos> Oh that's probably where they'll bury me <eos>

Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> My baby beside me at the wheel <eos> I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile <eos> My curiosity runnin' wild <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> I's anxious to tell her the way I feel <eos> So I told her softly and sincere <eos> And she leaned and whispered in my ear <eos> Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> No particular place to go <eos> So we parked way out on the kokomo <eos> The night was young and the moon was bold <eos> So we both decided to take a stroll <eos> Can you imagine the way I felt? <eos> I couldn't unfasten her safety belt <eos> Ridin' along in my calaboose <eos> Still tryin' to get her belt aloose <eos> All the way home I held a grudge <eos> But the safety belt it wouldn't budge <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos>

Lights go down, wheels go 'round <eos> I'm taking you home <eos> Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now <eos> I'm not ready to shut it down <eos> The way the dashboard glow <eos> Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind <eos> And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot <eos> Stop this car and throw it in park and just <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> (Slow dance in a parking lot) <eos> A half song gone, one door open, across the lot <eos> A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car <eos> Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time <eos> To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks <eos> You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman" <eos> And I don't care what song comes next <eos> I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> And get close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just <eos> A slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> 
Shotgun poetry <eos> Crack the whip again, and make me see <eos> Sharpen your knives for me <eos> Infiltrate the mind, the body <eos> Body <eos> Contract killer prose <eos> Calmly walks away as blood flows <eos> Open, the wound grows <eos> Melts away, the water froze <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> Contract killer prose <eos> Calmly walks away as blood flows <eos> Open, the wound grows <eos> Melts away, the water froze <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> My love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> Cause my love, my love, my love don't love me <eos> 
You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos> 
Botella tras botella ando tomando pa' olvidarme de ella (Pa' olvidarme de ella) <eos> De ella, de ella nomás hablo en todas mis pedas (En todas mis pedas) <eos> A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (Jajai) <eos> Me dicen: "Güey, ya la tienes que superar" <eos> Pero yo no puedo (Yo no puedo) <eos> Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero <eos> Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo <eos> Los tragos me saben mejor así <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte, yo te miro por todas partes <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos, puede que lo olvidemos <eos> Dos tragos y vuelvo a pensarte <eos> Me aferro, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Sentimientos ajenos, los celos no son buenos <eos> Y si me llamas contesto, aunque nunca va a pasar eso <eos> (Aunque nunca va a pasar eso) <eos> Ya mejor ni te molesto, porque sé que vuelvo a joderlo <eos> (Ahuevo que vuelvo a joderlo) <eos> Y ahora que ando tomando bebida me siento triste, ya va a amanecer <eos> A vece' borracho las penas se olvidan, pero nunca te dejé de querer <eos> Fui mal partido, querida, todas mis pedas marcándote al cel <eos> Le puse sal a la herida, cómo quisiera volver al ayer <eos> Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti <eos> (Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti) <eos> Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD <eos> (Y hasta te escribí un CD) <eos> Botella tras botella vo'a tomarme pa' acordarme de ella (Pa' acordarme de ella) <eos> De ella, de ella estoy hablando como siempre en mis pedas (Como siempre en mis pedas) <eos> A mis compas bien hartos traigo ya (Jajai) <eos> Me dicen: "Güey, ya la tienes que superar" <eos> Pero yo no puedo (Yo no puedo) <eos> Pa' ser sinceros, yo ni quiero <eos> Mejor su recuerdo me lo bebo <eos> Los tragos me saben mejor así <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte yo <eos> Estaba pensando en llamarte yo <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos <eos> Pero ya no nos vemos <eos> Sentimental yo me pongo, siempre me acuerdo de ti <eos> (Yo siempre me acuerdo de ti) <eos> Me agarra la depre seguido y hasta te escribí un CD <eos> (Y hasta te escribí un CD) <eos> Y si amas a alguien, no la dejes ir <eos> Para que no tengas que dedicarle una canción como esta <eos> Paz <eos> 
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> I've reached my last resort – suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck, if I cut my arms bleeding <eos> Do you even care, if I die bleeding? <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplatin' suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> I never realized I was spread too thin <eos> 'Til it was too late and I was empty within <eos> Hungry, feeding on chaos and livin' in sin <eos> Downward spiral, where do I begin? <eos> It all started when I lost my mother <eos> No love for myself and no love for another <eos> Searchin' to find a love upon a higher level <eos> Findin' nothin' but questions and devils <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I'm crying, I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Cut my life into pieces <eos> This is my last resort <eos> Suffocation, no breathing <eos> Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding <eos> Would it be wrong, would it be right <eos> If I took my life tonight? Chances are that I might <eos> Mutilation out of sight <eos> And I'm contemplating suicide <eos> 'Cause I'm losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Losin' my sight, losin' my mind <eos> Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine <eos> Nothing's alright, nothing is fine <eos> I'm runnin' and I'm crying <eos> I can't go on living this way <eos> Can't go on living this way <eos> Nothing's alright <eos> 
One shot and I'm holdin', but I don't care 'cuz I'm golden <eos> Woke up Sunday morning with a song stuck in my head <eos> Seein' things right before me <eos> Used to own me, but that's the old me <eos> And "give it up" was the best thing that they said <eos> We almost had it all <eos> Once again, all bets say, they won't make it <eos> Some day we'll have this thing figured out <eos> 'Til then, better go an' tell 'em <eos> Better go an' tell 'em <eos> We're gonna celebrate <eos> So watch me here as I levitate <eos> Gonna celebrate <eos> So watch me here as I levitate <eos> 3 o'clock in the mornin' <eos> Under the moonlight, another moment <eos> Stretched out in the centerfold that I can't get out of my head <eos> All these thing that they told me, used to mold me <eos> But that's the old me <eos> We're going straight to the stars 'cuz that's who we are <eos> We almost had it all <eos> Once again, all bets say, they won't make it <eos> Some day we'll have this thing figured out <eos> 'Til then, better go an' tell 'em <eos> Better go an' tell 'em <eos> We're gonna celebrate <eos> So watch me as I levitate <eos> (Let's take this way too far) <eos> We don't discriminate <eos> (No matter who you are) <eos> So watch me as I levitate <eos> We're gonna celebrate <eos> (Let's take this way too far) <eos> Gonna celebrate <eos> (No matter who you are) <eos> So watch me as I levitate <eos> (We're going past the stars) <eos> We don't discriminate <eos> (We'll take you past the stars) <eos> So watch me as I levitate <eos>

Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> At the Christmas party hop <eos> Mistletoe hung where you can see <eos> Every couple tries to stop <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Let the Christmas spirit ring <eos> Later we'll have some pumpkin pie <eos> And we'll do some caroling <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing, "Let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with boughs of holly!" <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone's dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashioned way <eos> You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear <eos> Voices singing, "Let's be jolly <eos> Deck the halls with boughs of holly!" <eos> Rockin' around the Christmas tree <eos> Have a happy holiday <eos> Everyone's dancing merrily <eos> In the new old fashioned way <eos> 
I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I see a line of cars and they're all painted black <eos> With flowers and my love, both never to come back <eos> I see people turn their heads and quickly look away <eos> Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day <eos> I look inside myself and see my heart is black <eos> I see my red door, I must have it painted black <eos> Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts <eos> It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black <eos> No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue <eos> I could not foresee this thing happening to you <eos> If I look hard enough into the setting sun <eos> My love will laugh with me before the morning comes <eos> I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted black <eos> Black as night, black as coal <eos> I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black <eos> Yeah <eos> 
Amor, amor, amor <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Quiero que me vuelvan a mirar tus ojos <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Quiero volver a besar tus labios rojos <eos> ¿Cómo no acordarme de ti? <eos> ¿De qué manera olvidarte? <eos> Si todo me recuerda a ti <eos> En todas partes estás tú <eos> Y dice <eos> Si en una rosa estás tú <eos> Si en cada respirar estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Si besando la cruz estás tú <eos> Rezando una oración estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Si te clavaste aquí en mi corazón <eos> Y mi amor, has llenado mi alma <eos> Y tu sangre corre por mis venas <eos> Y mi sangre me hace estremecer-me contigo <eos> Vicentico <eos> De la Argentina para el mundo <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Quiero que me vuelvan a mirar tus ojos <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Amor, amor, amor <eos> Quiero volver a besar tus labios rojos <eos> ¿Cómo no acordarme de ti? <eos> ¿De qué manera olvidarte? <eos> Si todo me recuerda a ti <eos> En todas partes estás tú <eos> Y dice <eos> Si en una rosa estás tú <eos> Si en cada respirar estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Si besando la cruz estás tú <eos> Rezando una oración estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Si en una rosa estás tú <eos> Si en cada respirar estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Si besando la cruz estás tú <eos> Rezando una oración estás tú <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> ¿Cómo te voy a olvidar? <eos> Los Ángeles Azules y Vicentico <eos> 
There's another world inside of me that you may never see <eos> There's secrets in this life that I can't hide <eos> But somewhere in this darkness <eos> There's a light that I can't find <eos> Well maybe it's too far away, yeah <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When your education x-ray <eos> Cannot see under my skin <eos> I won't tell you a damn thing <eos> That I could not tell my friends <eos> Roaming through this darkness <eos> I'm alive, but I'm alone <eos> And part of me is fighting this <eos> But part of me is gone <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> 
They say that I'm wasted potential <eos> Meant to make my days all eventful <eos> But sometimes I can’t help but stay at home <eos> Toke on buds to cope with my mental <eos> She says that I'm kind and I'm gentle <eos> But really I’m just scared to be alone <eos> Maybe if I tell you that I hate you, then you'll give me my space <eos> Maybe if I say I love you, then you'll throw it back in my face <eos> I'm a homebody, don't owe nobody nothin' <eos> Thought she was bluffin', but she really took my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I'm a homebody, don’t go nobody’s functions <eos> And she comes to the junction just to take my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I might step out in my sliders, ain't goin’ nowhere <eos> Please don't ask me how my mind is <eos> 'Cause you don't care <eos> I need someone to confide in, someone I can trust <eos> ’Cause I'm getting sick of hidin' <eos> Maybe if I tell you that I hate you then you'll give me my space <eos> Maybe if I say I love you then you'll throw it back in my face <eos> I'm a homebody, don't owe nobody nothin' <eos> Thought she was bluffing but she really took my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos> I'm a homebody, don't go nobody's functions <eos> And she comes to the junction just to take my breath away <eos> Dreamt about it yesterday <eos>

Vicente García <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> Yo quiero hacerle una canción a esta mujer <eos> No puede ser que me abandones otra vez <eos> Y me traiciones otra vez, inspiración <eos> Negándote <eos> Ya lo intenté con un poema y fracasé <eos> Fuimos al cine, al teatro y al ballet <eos> Ninguna de esas estrategias funcionó <eos> Ayúdame <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Una letra que le pueda enamorar <eos> Y le daré la más bella canción con mi guitarra <eos> Solo falta que me quieras ayudar, no me vuelvas a fallar <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> Y decidí volver a la composición <eos> Y recurrir a mi experiencia musical <eos> Estoy seguro que la puede conquistar <eos> Cantándole <eos> No es tan difícil componer una canción <eos> Cuando se tiene voluntad y vocación <eos> Pero es más fácil con tu colaboración <eos> Ayúdame <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Una letra que le pueda enamorar <eos> Y le daré la más bella canción con mi guitarra <eos> Solo falta que me quieras ayudar, no me vuelvas a fallar <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Cuando escucha mi guitarra enamorada <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Hoy, como ayer, yo te sigo queriendo, mujer <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Ya no me queda tiempo para cantarte de nuevo, mi cielo <eos> Woah, woah, woah, woah <eos> Woah, woah, woah, woah <eos> Woah, woah (¡Ayúdame!), woah, woah(¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Woah, woah (¡Ayúdame!), woah, woah(¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Baile (¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Pero póngase sabrosura (¡Ayúdame!) <eos> ¡Ayúdame, ayúdame! <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> ¡Ayúdame, ayúdame! <eos> ¡Ayúdame! (Woah, woah) <eos> 
Well, I don’t know what happens when we go <eos> But I hear that the streets are paved in gold <eos> And maybe there’s a little red dirt for my soul <eos> And maybe, just maybe the beer’s still cold <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> Well, I wonder if that light at the end is neon <eos> And I sure hope there’s a barstool for me to be on <eos> Give me Hank, give me Cash, give me Merle, give me Jones <eos> I know where I’m going when I’m home <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> That’s where I’ll be <eos>

Hablado: suavecito, suavecito, suavecito, suavecito <eos> Con sabor, santa maría, mariachi <eos> Esta me salió peor que la otra compadre <eos> Elegante, preciosa, despampanante <eos> Pero muy interesada <eos> Y lloré, cuando la vi que se marchaba <eos> No hubo poder que su decisión cambiara <eos> Ahogué mi amor, en un mar lleno de lágrimas <eos> Y naufragó una pasión que terminaba <eos> No le hago al mártir ni quiero llorarla <eos> Pero la recuerdo <eos> Cuando se fue, me faltaba hasta el aire <eos> Pero más sus besos <eos> A lo mejor <eos> La sigo amando y me duele saberlo <eos> Por eso voy <eos> A besar otros labios, mientras lloro por dentro <eos> Mi corazón <eos> Sufre la pena, pero lo hace en silencio <eos> Porque cobró <eos> El amor que me daba, cada caricia y beso <eos> Hablado: chiquita prefiero perderte <eos> Que mantenerte, ayayay <eos> Con el sabor, santa maría, mariachi mira <eos> Ahogué mi amor, en un mar lleno de lágrimas <eos> Y naufragó una pasión que terminaba <eos> No le hago al mártir ni quiero llorarla <eos> Pero la recuerdo <eos> Cuando se fue, me faltaba hasta el aire <eos> Pero más sus besos <eos> A lo mejor <eos> La sigo amando y me duele saberlo <eos> Por eso voy <eos> A besar otros labios, mientras lloro por dentro <eos> Mi corazón <eos> Sufre la pena, pero lo hace en silencio <eos> Porque cobró <eos> El amor que me daba, cada caricia y beso <eos>

When I wake up in the morning, love <eos> And the sunlight hurts my eyes <eos> And something without warning, love <eos> Bears heavy on my mind <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> When the day that lies ahead of me <eos> Seems impossible to face <eos> When someone else instead of me <eos> Always seems to know the way <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> When the day that lies ahead of me <eos> Seems impossible to face <eos> When someone else instead of me <eos> Always seems to know the way <eos> Then I look at you <eos> And the world's alright with me <eos> Just one look at you <eos> And I know it's gonna be <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> A lovely day <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day) <eos> (Lovely day, lovely day) <eos> 
Take me to the ocean <eos> Take me to the sea <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be free <eos> Wash away my worries <eos> Let my soul be... <eos> What now, it’s coming around <eos> You’re feeling cut down into the ground <eos> So we all come together, we’re making a sound <eos> We sing “Look at all this love we’ve found” <eos> Gotta raise em up, toast to the sweet life <eos> If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right <eos> See the sun giving me the green light <eos> To kick back, relax and soak up the sweet sights <eos> There’s something in the air <eos> Come and take away my cares <eos> I close my eyes <eos> Remember these dreams that we share <eos> I wash it all away <eos> You gotta give us all a break <eos> Let the troubles of tomorrow <eos> Wait till another day <eos> When life’s moving to fast <eos> We can make this dream last <eos> Just let the past be the past <eos> Just leave it all behind <eos> 
Down here the river, meets the sea <eos> And in the sticky heat, I feel ya' open up to me <eos> Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> Lying here, underneath the stars, right next to you <eos> And I'm wondering who you are and, how do you do? <eos> How do you do, baby? <eos> Clouds roll in across the moon and the wind hollers out your name <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> {Guitar Solo: Buddy Guy} <eos> We never going to make that bridge tonight, baby <eos> Across lake Ponchartrain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> So batten down the hatch baby and leave your heart up your sleeve <eos> It looks like we're in for stormy weather, that ain't no cause for us to leave <eos> Just lay here, in my arms, let it wash away the pain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos>

Une nuit je m'endors avec lui <eos> Mais je sais qu'on nous l'interdit <eos> Et je sens la fièvre qui me mord <eos> Sans que j'aie l'ombre d'un remords <eos> Et l'aurore m'apporte le sommeil <eos> Je ne veux pas qu'arrive le soleil <eos> Quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains <eos> Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin <eos> Et je me demande <eos> Si cet amour aura un lendemain <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête <eos> Et je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Oh ! je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Je ressens la pluie d'une autre planète <eos> Quand il me serre tout contre lui <eos> Quand je sens que j'entre dans sa vie <eos> Je prie pour que le destin m'en sorte <eos> Je prie pour que le diable m'emporte <eos> Et l'angoisse me montre son visage <eos> Elle me force à parler son langage <eos> Mais quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains <eos> Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin <eos> Et je me demande <eos> Si cet amour aura un lendemain <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête <eos> Et je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Non je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Je ressens la pluie d'une autre planète <eos>

Deja de mentirte (Ah) <eos> La foto que subiste con él diciendo que era tu cielo <eos> Bebé, yo te conozco tan bien, sé que fue pa' darme celos <eos> No te diré quién, pero llorando por mí te vieron <eos> Por mí te vieron <eos> Déjame decirte <eos> Se ve que él te trata bien, que es todo un caballero <eos> Pero eso no cambiará que yo llegué primero <eos> Sé que te va ir bien, pero no te quiere como yo te quiero <eos> Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na' <eos> Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones <eos> Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas <eos> Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea <eos> Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na' <eos> Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones <eos> Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas <eos> Pa' que yo vea cómo te va de bien, pero te haces mal <eos> Porque el amor no se compra con na' <eos> Miéntele a todos tus seguidore' <eos> Dile que los tiempo' de ahora son mejore' <eos> No creo que cuando te llame me ignores <eos> Si después de mí ya no habrán más amores <eos> Tú y yo fuimo' uno <eos> Lo hacíamo' en ayuna' antes del desayuno <eos> Fumábamo' la hookah y te pasaba el humo <eos> Y ahora en esta guerra no gana ninguno <eos> Si me preguntas, nadie tiene culpa <eos> A vece' los problemas a uno se le juntan <eos> Déjame hablar, porfa, no me interrumpas <eos> Si te hice algo malo, entonces discúlpame <eos> La gente te lo va a creer, actúas bien ese papel <eos> Baby, pero no eres feliz con él <eos> Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na' <eos> Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones <eos> Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas <eos> Pa' que yo vea cómo te va, pa' que yo vea <eos> Puede que no te haga falta na', aparentemente na' <eos> Hawái de vacaciones, mis felicitaciones <eos> Muy lindo en Instagram lo que posteas <eos> Pa' que yo vea cómo te va de bien, pero te haces mal <eos> Porque el amor no se compra con na' <eos> (Deja de mentirte) <eos> (La foto que subiste con él diciendo que era tu cielo) <eos> Mamacita <eos> (Bebé, yo te conozco tan bien, sé que fue pa' darme celos) <eos> Maluma, baby <eos> (No te diré quién, pero llorando por mí te vieron) <eos> Jajajaja <eos> (Por mí te vieron) <eos> Papi Juancho <eos> 
I like the shades you're wearing and I like your new tattoo <eos> I see you went and dyed your hair and got a new perfume <eos> I shouldda known you'd be here dancin' to a fiddle song <eos> Kickin' up dust and stirring up mem'ries, blurring lines between right and wrong <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a lightening strike sheds light on falling rain <eos> Some things never change <eos> I feel there's still a sliver of my old love-lorn soul <eos> Tangled inside your heart that I lost long ago <eos> Cause longin' don't seem to matter how many years go by <eos> You and me we fit together we don't even have to try <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a bonfire fades when it runs out of flame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Will the way you feel remain the same? <eos> They say true love finds a way <eos> No the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> And I'll be by myself as the sun shines on my shame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> 
Do you mind if I wild out <eos> A little? <eos> 'Cause I'm just a little drunk and I wanna come party with you <eos> A little <eos> Can I look into your eyes? <eos> I can tell that you're high too <eos> But that's okay, baby, 'cause I just wanna party with you <eos> 'Cause when we hit the peak, baby <eos> I just wanna party with you <eos> All night <eos> Someone hold my phone 'cause I can't hold my tongue <eos> 'Cause if I get too drunk, baby, then I'm gonna ruin the fun <eos> That's not your problem, it's because I've seen too much, baby <eos> Sorry if I get a little PTSD <eos> But I just wanna party with you <eos> All night <eos> Because you make me happy <eos> That's right <eos> I only wanna party with you <eos> Tonight <eos> Because you make everything <eos> Alright <eos> 
Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen <eos> Tonight we'll put all other things aside <eos> Give in this time and show me some affection <eos> We're going for those pleasures in the night <eos> I want to love you, feel you <eos> Wrap myself around you <eos> I want to squeeze you, please you <eos> I just can't get enough <eos> And if you move real slow, I'll let it go <eos> I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it <eos> I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it <eos> I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know I want you <eos> We shouldn't even think about tomorrow <eos> Sweet memories will last a long, long time <eos> We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry <eos> And if we're still playing 'round, boy, that's just fine <eos> Let's get excited, we just can't hide it <eos> I'm about to lose control and I think I like it <eos> I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know I want you, I want you <eos> I want to love you, feel you <eos> Wrap myself around you <eos> I want to squeeze you, please you <eos> I just can't get enough <eos> And if you move real slow, I'll let it go <eos> I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it <eos> I'm about to lose control and I think I like it <eos> I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know <eos> I know I want you, want you <eos> I'm so excited (Look what you do to me) <eos> And I just can't hide it (You’ve got me burning up) <eos> I'm about to lose control and I think I like it (Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow!) <eos> I'm so excited (How did you get to me?) <eos> And I can't deny it (I’ve got to give it up) <eos> And I know, I know, I know, I know (Oh, oh, oh, oh ow!) <eos> I know I want you, want you <eos> I'm so excited (Look what you do to me) <eos> Oh boy (You’ve got me burning up) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow! <eos> I'm so excited <eos> (How did you get to me?) <eos> Look at me (I’ve got to give it up) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh ow! <eos> I'm so excited <eos> (Look what you do to me, you’ve got me burning up) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, ow! <eos> 
I sat by the ocean <eos> And drank a potion, baby, to erase you <eos> Face down in the boulevard <eos> Yet, I couldn't face you <eos> There ain't no use in crying <eos> It doesn't change anything <eos> So, baby, what good does it do? <eos> Your friends, they all sympathize <eos> Maybe I don’t need them to <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead, I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> There's nowhere to run away <eos> Said, "Boy, if you want love <eos> You'll have to go and find it with someone new <eos> Do you know who you really are <eos> Are you sure it's really you?" <eos> Lies are a funny thing <eos> They slip through your fingertips <eos> Because they never happened to you <eos> Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> Into the light, left with nowhere to hide <eos> Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night <eos> 
Letra de "Carcel" ft. Mariel Mariel <eos> Uh <eos> Una linea y luego otra, brotan <eos> Directo a tu cabeza, flotan <eos> Te caen encima como chotas <eos> Me ves como diciendo bien bajada esa pelota <eos> Siempre se nota quien lleva la batuta <eos> Tú dices que eres libre pero te insultan e insultas <eos> Te alaban y sonríes <eos> Estas atado al ego compa, ya no te confíes <eos> Querer gustarle a todos es mediocre, ¿que no? <eos> Tu pedazo de verdad esta guardado en el silencio <eos> Traes un pinche cochinero existencial igual que yo <eos> Sentimos que la vida nos atropelló <eos> Nadie sabe nada mejor, yo soy superior <eos> Mames, no sabes ni madres <eos> Ni siquiera sabes que no sabes <eos> Si crees que tienes ases, el ego es una cárcel <eos> De donde muy pocos tienen ganas de escaparse <eos> Barras <eos> Carcelero, ábrame la puerta <eos> Que esta jaula es para locos <eos> Aquí estamos todos juntos <eos> Creyendo que estamos todos solos <eos> Cayo la noche, un cielo de color lila <eos> Entra por las pupilas, enciendo el coche <eos> Doblando esquinas, avenidas, bulevares <eos> Conduzco entre nubes de posibilidades <eos> No llego tarde a ningún lado, siempre estoy ahí si debo <eos> Soy feliz si bebo, si me elevo <eos> Se que me he equivocado y me equivocaré de nuevo <eos> Heridas de la madrugada, comprendo el juego <eos> Si ando solo es porque quiero, necesito estar aparte <eos> Debo de hablar conmigo un par de asuntos importantes <eos> Sigo siendo el de antes, pero no como antes <eos> Hoy voy seguro al volante <eos> Tu crees solo lo que ves, por eso estás ciego <eos> La verdad es dolorosa, lástima, es el fuego <eos> Ahora te va a doler mas de lo que te duele <eos> Si todo lo que sabes lo aprendiste en la tele <eos> Lo aprendiste en la tele, lo aprendiste llorando <eos> Para que nadie te este criticando <eos> Yo, yo, yo voy a destruir <eos> Mi comportamiento clásico <eos> Lo aprendiste en la tele, lo aprendiste llorando <eos> Para que nadie te este criticando <eos> Yo, yo, yo voy a destruir <eos> Mi comportamiento clásico <eos> Carcelero, ábrame la puerta <eos> Que esta jaula es para locos <eos> Aquí estamos todos juntos <eos> Creyendo que estamos todos solos <eos> En algún instante del futuro esta presente <eos> El peso del pasado, delirios de la mente <eos> Quien es inteligente ríe siempre <eos> Sabe que lo que ve es una ilusión y se divierte <eos> Esta latiendo fuerte el corazón del deseo <eos> Enfermos de locura, escribas y fariseos <eos> Silencios y vacíos en caminos peligrosos <eos> Recuerdos moribundos y el olvido piadoso <eos> Siempre estas oculto detrás de la apariencias <eos> Si te gusta sufrir sufrirás las consecuencias <eos> De vivir encerrado dentro de tu personaje <eos> Traje de carne y hueso: esa es tu cárcel <eos> Carcelero, ábrame la puerta <eos> Que esta jaula es para locos <eos> Aquí estamos todos juntos <eos> Creyendo que estamos todos solos <eos> Carcelero, ábrame la puerta <eos> Que esta jaula es para locos <eos> Aquí estamos todos juntos <eos> Creyendo que estamos todos solos <eos> 
You know what I think heaven is? <eos> I think heaven is you <eos> You know that?

Uno por pobre y feo, home, pero antojao' <eos> Ah, hijueputa <eos> Tengo la camisa negra, hoy mi amor está de luto <eos> Hoy tengo en el alma una pena y es por culpa de tu embrujo <eos> Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele <eos> Mal parece que solo me quedé <eos> Y fue pura todita tu mentira <eos> Qué maldita mala suerte la mía <eos> Que aquel día te encontré <eos> Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor <eos> Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor <eos> Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós <eos> Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo <eos> Tengo la camisa negra porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby, te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra y debajo tengo el difunto <eos> ¡Pa' enterrártelo cuando quieras, mamita! ¡Juya! <eos> Así como lo oye, mija <eos> Tengo la camisa negra, ya tu amor no me interesa <eos> Lo que ayer me supo a gloria hoy me sabe a pura <eos> Miércoles por la tarde y tú que no llegas, ni siquiera muestras señas <eos> Y yo con la camisa negra y tus maletas en la puerta <eos> Mal parece que solo me quedé <eos> Y fue pura todita tu mentira <eos> Que maldita mala suerte la mía <eos> Que aquel día te encontré <eos> Por beber del veneno malevo de tu amor <eos> Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor <eos> Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós <eos> Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo <eos> Tengo la camisa negra <eos> Porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma <eos> Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby <eos> Te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra <eos> Y debajo tengo el difunto <eos> Tengo la camisa negra <eos> Porque negra tengo el alma <eos> Yo por ti perdí la calma <eos> Y casi pierdo hasta mi cama <eos> Cama-cama, come on, baby <eos> Te digo con disimulo <eos> Que tengo la camisa negra <eos> Y debajo tengo el difunto <eos>

In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos>

Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> 
All I do is think about you <eos> I need more hours in the day <eos> I always seem to run out of time <eos> When I think about you (When I think about you, oh) <eos> I could be doing other things <eos> But you're all that's on my mind <eos> When I'm not around you (When I'm not around you, oh) <eos> And this would sound so cute, sound so sweet (So sweet) <eos> If you felt the same way 'bout me <eos> But this love is unrequited <eos> And I've tried to fight it <eos> You're not a want, you're a need <eos> I need more hours in the day (Hours in the day) <eos> (I need more hours in the day) <eos> Just to think about you (Just to think about you) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos> Whinin' up, off the Hen, I was rolling <eos> You stepped in the right time to feel the motion <eos> I turned around because I like to dance alone and <eos> You were fine so I was glad that I was chosen <eos> Out of all the bufftings in the party <eos> But when we spoke I knew I had just what you wanted <eos> Island babe our connection felt old <eos> The wickedest, where I went you'd follow <eos> And this would sound so cute, sound so nice (So sweet) <eos> If the night we met would suffice <eos> But you're so cold that I'm reminded <eos> That you're not mine <eos> And with that you're alright <eos> I need more hours in the day (Hours in the day) <eos> Just to think about you (Just to think about you) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos> Wagwan <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> All I do is think about you (All I do is think about you) <eos>

I’ve cussed on a Sunday <eos> I’ve cheated and I’ve lied <eos> I’ve fallen down from grace <eos> A few too many times <eos> But I find holy redemption <eos> When I put this car in drive <eos> Roll the windows down and turn up the dial <eos> Can I get a hallelujah? <eos> Can I get an amen? <eos> Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya <eos> When I play the highway FM <eos> I find my soul revival <eos> Singin' every single verse <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> When Hank brings the sermon <eos> And Cash leads the choir <eos> It gets my cold, cold heart burnin' <eos> Hotter than a ring of fire <eos> When this wonderful world gets heavy <eos> And I need to find my escape <eos> I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling <eos> Until my sins wash away <eos> Can I get a hallelujah? <eos> Can I get an amen? <eos> Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya <eos> When I play the highway FM <eos> I find my soul revival <eos> Singin' every single verse <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> Can I get a hallelujah? <eos> Can I get an amen? <eos> Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya <eos> When I play the highway FM <eos> I find my soul revival <eos> Singin' every single verse <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> Can I get a hallelujah? <eos> Can I get an amen? <eos> Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya <eos> When I play the highway FM <eos> I find my soul revival <eos> Singin' every single verse <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> Yeah, I guess that’s my church <eos> 
Every Sunday I see people <eos> Filing in through those front doors <eos> Got a cross up on that steeple <eos> Yeah, it's time to praise the Lord <eos> Some watch it on their TV <eos> Sittin' on the couch <eos> Me, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out <eos> Oh, ain't got too many miles to go <eos> To save my soul <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Now there ain't nothing wrong <eos> With puttin' on your Sunday best <eos> Me, I won't be wearin' <eos> Nothin' that I can't get wet <eos> I just think about how small I am and life after we're gone <eos> I'm out here by myself, but I know I'm not alone <eos> Yeah, I got all the proof I need <eos> And it sure makes me believe <eos> When I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Amen <eos> I'm in heaven watching all these waves roll in <eos> Amen <eos> When I'm lost I know where to get found again <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Yeah, I go down and sink my feet in the water <eos> And I soak up that sun and I watch it set <eos> Yeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel <eos> I'm as close to God as I can get <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos> Whoa, whoa, yeah <eos>

Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos>

As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing <eos> The tune about the wild side of life <eos> As I listen to the words you are saying <eos> It brings memories when I was a trusting wife <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> It's a shame that all the blame is on us women <eos> It's not true that only you men feel the same <eos> From the start most every heart that's ever broken <eos> Was because there always was a man to blame <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> 
I really can't stay (Baby I'm fine with that) <eos> I've got to go away (Baby I'm cool with that) <eos> This evening has been (Been hoping you get home safe) <eos> So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time) <eos> My mother will start to worry (Call her so she knows that you're coming) <eos> Father will be pacing the floor (Better get your car a-humming) <eos> So really I'd better scurry (No rush) <eos> Should I use the front or back door? (Which one are you pulling towards more?) <eos> The neighbors might think (That you're a real nice girl) <eos> What is this drink? (Pomegranate La Croix) <eos> I wish I knew how (Maybe I can help you out) <eos> To break this spell (I don't know what you're talking about) <eos> I ought to say no, no, no (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried (you reserve the right to say no) <eos> I really can't stay (...Well you don't have to) <eos> Baby it's cold outside <eos> I've got to get home (Do you know how to get there from here) <eos> Say, where is my coat (I'll go and grab it my dear) <eos> You've really been grand (We'll have to do this again) <eos> Yes I agree (How 'bout the Cheesecake Factory?) <eos> We're bound to be talking tomorrow (Text me at your earliest convenience) <eos> At least I have been getting that vibe (Unless I catch pneumonia and die) <eos> I'll be on my way (Thanks for the great night) <eos>

What’s the matter with you <eos> The happy feeling’s gone <eos> Don’t know what’s going on <eos> Don’t know what to do <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> You never laugh these days <eos> Your smile it’s gone away <eos> I wish you would tell the truth <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> Have I forgotten a promise I made you, one I couldn’t keep? <eos> Maybe it’s something I said, I’ve been known, to talk in my sleep <eos> You’ve got a stormy cloud hanging above you, wherever you go <eos> I wish you would tell me, the silence is killing, every little thing that we had <eos> What’s the matter with you <eos> The happy feeling’s gone <eos> Don’t know what’s going on <eos> Oh I don’t know what to do <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> You never laugh these days <eos> Your smile it’s gone away <eos> I wish you would tell the truth <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> What have I done, if I thought it would help <eos> I’d say sorry in a heartbeat, in a heartbeat <eos> Down on my knees, praying the lord, bring him back to me, back oh <eos> If you can’t tell me, write me a letter <eos> Or call a friend and have them tell me <eos> What’s the matter with you <eos> The happy feeling’s gone <eos> Oh I don’t know, what’s going on <eos> Yeah don’t know what to do <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> Oh you never laugh these days <eos> Your smile it’s gone away <eos> I wish you would tell the truth <eos> What is the matter with you <eos> What’s the matter <eos> Come on please tell me <eos> 
I heard he sang a lullaby <eos> I heard he sang it from his heart <eos> When I found out <eos> Thought I would die <eos> Because that lullaby was mine <eos> I heard he sealed it with a kiss <eos> He gently kissed her cherry lips <eos> I found that so hard to believe <eos> Because his kiss <eos> Belonged to me <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> Why didn't he catch my falling star <eos> I wish I didn't wish so hard <eos> Maybe I wished our love apart <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> I heard her face <eos> Was white as rain <eos> Soft as a rose <eos> That blooms in May <eos> He keeps her picture in a frame <eos> And when he sleeps he calls her name <eos> I wonder if she makes him smile <eos> The way he used to smile at me <eos> I hope she doesn't make him laugh <eos> Because his laugh belongs to me <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> Why didn't he catch my falling star <eos> I wish I didn't wish so hard <eos> Maybe I wished our love apart <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> Oh my soul is dying, it's crying <eos> I'm trying to understand <eos> Please help me <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> Why didn't he catch my falling star <eos> I wish I didn't wish so hard <eos> Maybe I wished our love apart <eos> How could an angel break my heart <eos> 
Me dejas sin palabras <eos> Suddenly I'm not as fluent as I used to be <eos> If I told you that I liked you, would you like that? <eos> Now words don't come so easily <eos> Lo que pasó, ya no duele tanto <eos> Think that I can move on <eos> But I'm not sure what you want from me <eos> If you want from me <eos> Tú me has esperado tanto tiempo <eos> Ya me tienes donde quieres <eos> Y no te das cuenta <eos> How much, how much, can I make it anymore— <eos> Escribo sobre ti y ya tengo todo más claro <eos> You said it's really not that deep <eos> To' lo de ante' no era pa' tanto <eos> Me dejas sin palabras <eos> But what does it matter? <eos> If I told you how I'm feeling, would you feel it too? <eos> I don't speak with so much fluеncy <eos> Words don't come as easily as they usеd to <eos> I think I got it, but it's not it and it throws me off <eos> You're a constant learning curve for me <eos> (Pa' qué lo sabes) <eos> Lo que pasó, ya no duele tanto <eos> Think that I can move on <eos> But I'm not sure what you want from me <eos> If you want from me <eos> Tú me has esperado tanto tiempo <eos> Ya me tienes donde quieres <eos> Y no te das cuenta <eos> How much, how much, can I make it anymore obvious? <eos> Probably <eos> Could I make it anymore obvious? <eos> (Could I make it anymore obvious? Probably) <eos> (You're a constant learning curve for me) <eos> 
I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> If you ask, just to show that I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> That it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> A return from unnatural vacation <eos> Left my mind and left my body vacant <eos> To remove from an old situation <eos> To where it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> So wait in the last place you lost me <eos> I aim to change, play the rules <eos> That I've wanted to break <eos> But refuse any longer <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> Just for you, I could show you I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> And never forget <eos> Never forget <eos> Never <eos> 
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag <eos> Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? <eos> Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin <eos> Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in? <eos> Do you ever feel already buried deep? <eos> Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing <eos> Do you know that there's still a chance for you? <eos> 'Cause there's a spark in you <eos> You just gotta ignite the light <eos> And let it shine <eos> Just own the night <eos> Like the Fourth of July <eos> 'Cause baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on show 'em what you're worth <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> As you shoot across the sky <eos> Baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on, let your colors burst <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe <eos> You don't have to feel like a waste of space <eos> You're original, cannot be replaced <eos> If you only knew what the future holds <eos> After a hurricane comes a rainbow <eos> Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed <eos> So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road <eos> Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow <eos> And when it's time, you'll know <eos> You just gotta ignite the light <eos> And let it shine <eos> Just own the night <eos> Like the Fourth of July <eos> 'Cause baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on, show 'em what you're worth <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> As you shoot across the sky <eos> Baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on, let your colors burst <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe <eos> Boom, boom, boom <eos> Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon <eos> It's always been inside of you, you, you <eos> And now it's time to let it through <eos> 'Cause baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on, show 'em what you're worth <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> As you shoot across the sky <eos> Baby, you're a firework <eos> Come on, let your colors burst <eos> Make 'em go, "Aah, aah, aah" <eos> You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe <eos> Boom, boom, boom <eos> Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon <eos> Boom, boom, boom <eos> Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon <eos> 
Teardrops <eos> We hurt ourselves for fun <eos> Force-feed our fear until our hearts go numb <eos> Addicted to a lonely kind of love <eos> What I wanna know <eos> Is how we get this stressed out, paranoid <eos> Everything is going dark <eos> Nothing makes me sadder than my head <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> I'm tripping on the edge <eos> High as a kite, I'm never coming down <eos> And if you hear me, guess you know how it feels <eos> To be alone <eos> So how'd we get this stressed out, paranoid? <eos> Everything is going dark <eos> Nothing makes me sadder than my head <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind <eos> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ <eos> Suicidal, violent, tragic state of mind <eos> Lost my halo, now I'm my own anti-christ <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> I'm running outta teardrops, let it hurt till it stops <eos> I can't keep my grip, I'm slipping away from me <eos> Oh, God, everything is so fucked, but I can't feel a thing <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> Teardrops <eos> Teardrops <eos> I'm running outta teardrops <eos> The emptiness is heavier than you think <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos> 
Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there <eos> But if you don't put faith in what you believe in <eos> It's getting you nowhere <eos> Cause it hurts, you never let go <eos> Don't look down, just look up <eos> Cause she's always there behind you, just to remind you <eos> Two hearts, believing in just one mind <eos> You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind <eos> Cause there's no easy way to, to understand it <eos> There's so much of my life in her, and it's like i'm blinded <eos> And it teaches you to never let go <eos> There's so much love you'll never know <eos> She can reach you no matter how far <eos> Wherever you are <eos> Two hearts, believing in just one mind <eos> Beating together till the end of time <eos> You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind <eos> Together forever till the end of time <eos> She knows (she knows) <eos> There will always be a special place in my heart for her <eos> She knows, she knows, she knows <eos> Yeah, she knows (she knows) <eos> No matter how far apart we are <eos> She knows, i'm always right there beside her <eos> Two hearts, believing in just one mind <eos> Beating together till the end of time <eos> You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind <eos> Together forever till the end of time  <eos> 
I used to think that I deserved this <eos> Tried my best but never perfect <eos> I was helpless, and you know it <eos> You like to think you're a martyr, but you're just abusive, so now <eos> I'm not afraid to admit that there's nothing left <eos> I know you try to manipulate me again <eos> But I've come to grips with the fact that what's dead is dead <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would'vе never let you in <eos> Yеah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> All the years spent with a vermin <eos> Left me soul-sick, always searching <eos> I learned that trust is really worth it <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> This is cut ties, no goodbye, nail in the coffin <eos> This is the nail in the coffin <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> You were never being honest <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> Blood's not thicker than water after all <eos>

Si nos dejan, nos vamos a querer toda la vida <eos> Si nos dejan, nos vamos a vivir a un mundo nuevo <eos> Yo creo podemos ver el nuevo amanecer de un nuevo día <eos> Yo pienso que tú y yo podemos ser felices todavía <eos> Si nos dejan, buscamos un rincón cerca del cielo <eos> Si nos dejan, haremos con las nubes terciopelo <eos> Y ahí juntitos los dos <eos> Cerquita de Dios será lo que soñamos <eos> Si nos dejan, te llevo de la mano, corazón <eos> Y ahí nos vamos <eos> Si nos dejan, buscamos un rincón cerca del cielo <eos> Si nos dejan, harеmos con las nubes terciopelo <eos> Y ahí juntitos los dos <eos> Cеrquita de Dios será lo que soñamos <eos> Si nos dejan, te llevo de la mano, corazón <eos> Y ahí nos vamos <eos> Si nos dejan, de todo lo demás nos olvidamos <eos> Si nos dejan <eos> Si nos dejan <eos> 
Contemplating what's gonna be <eos> Wondering which way to turn <eos> Lotta things left to be learned <eos> Complicating silly old me <eos> The things I hold on to <eos> Just let it go & see what it do <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we want to see <eos> Just what we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> Fantasizing having myself a ball <eos> Staring up at the big screen <eos> Problem is I'm the only one <eos> Who's seen it <eos> Realizing it's not like that at all <eos> Time to come down to Earth <eos> & feel what it's really worth <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we wanna see <eos> Just want we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> 
Mr. Big Stuff <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Now because you wear all those fancy clothes (oh yeah) <eos> And have a big fine car, oh yes you do now <eos> Do you think I can afford to give you my love (oh yeah) <eos> You think you're higher than every star above <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Now I know all the girls I've seen you with <eos> I know you broke their hearts one after another now, bit by bit <eos> You made 'em cry, many poor girls cry <eos> When they tried to keep you happy, they just tried to keep you satisfied <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me, tell me <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true (oh yeah) <eos> Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you <eos> 'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return (oh yeah) <eos> Now I know this is a lesson Mr. Big Stuff you haven't learned <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna break my heart <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna make me cry <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me <eos> Just who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna break my heart <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna make me cry <eos> Mr. Big Stuff, tell me, tell me <eos> Just who do you think you are? <eos> Mr. Big Stuff <eos> You're never gonna get my love <eos> 
Hooray it's Christmas time <eos> But there's one lousy tradition <eos> There's a certain show that you will see <eos> That is all and many would agree <eos> It is time to find another show to substitute <eos> For the Nutcracker <eos> I'm watching the game <eos> But something's wrong <eos> Staring is my wife <eos> Her face looks long <eos> I know that look, it must be me <eos> It's not our anniversary <eos> I shrug, no clue <eos> What did I do <eos> She stands in disbelief (What?) <eos> This holiday scene brings no laughter <eos> Forced going to see The Nutcracker <eos> I try to block it from my mind <eos> Think fast, what reason can I find? <eos> Got work to do, I'll fake the flu <eos> No chance, I'm done, I'm screwed (No!) <eos> I've seen the Nutcracker twenty times <eos> Sure it is fun if you are four (bum) <eos> Don't call me a Scrooge 'cause it's a bore <eos> The story's dated and that Mouse King thing <eos> Freaks me out (Ahh!) <eos> Well, guess I'm a guy, what can I say <eos> I'd rather watch football than ballet <eos> I try my hardest not to groan <eos> And pull the score up on my phone <eos> As I complain, "It's not the same" <eos> We're rushing out the door (Go!) <eos> All holiday shoppers on the road <eos> My holiday spirit might explode <eos> Of course, there is no place to park <eos> We're late, the theatre's in the dark <eos> In no small feat, we find a seat <eos> The show's about to start (Shh) <eos> Here's that song from Tetris <eos> And I know it's the part <eos> When I fight not to fall asleep <eos> March the wooden soldiers <eos> Bunch of mice start a fight <eos> Land of sweets, man this stuff's trippy <eos> By the way, this story makes no sense <eos> Still don't know what it means <eos> After all these years <eos> So confusing, feel like snoozing <eos> Eyes are heavy, as I start to dream <eos> Woah, I'm awake, must have fallen asleep <eos> Guess I didn't snore or make a peep <eos> 'Cause my wife had no clue I'd been out cold <eos> Is the finale coming up <eos> 'Cause there is no beer left in my cup <eos> To make it through, I'll need another drink <eos> Snuck out to the lobby <eos> Oh, look, I found a TV <eos> I forgot the game was happening <eos> It's down to the wire <eos> Time will soon expire <eos> Down by one, this kick would win it <eos> (Hut, hut) The ball snapped <eos> (Oh, no) The kick's bad <eos> (Wide right) No <eos> (We lost) No <eos> How could this night get any worse? <eos> Now I'm feeling all depressed <eos> But I still have to act impressed <eos> A pirouette, oh wow, that's great <eos> A six-year-old could do that, too <eos> Saw my team lose at the bar <eos> Now dancing dudes in leotards <eos> Last Nutcracker hopefully <eos> But my wife's thinking differently <eos> She leans in closely, whispers softly <eos> "Can't wait for you to take me next year." <eos>

Walking on a dream <eos> How can I explain? <eos> Talking to myself <eos> Will I see again? <eos> We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <eos> Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it <eos> On and on and on we are calling out, out again <eos> Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Thought I'd never see <eos> The love you found in me <eos> Now it's changing all the time <eos> Living in a rhythm where the minute's working over time <eos> We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it <eos> Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it <eos> On and on and on we are calling out, out again <eos> Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Catch me, I'm falling down <eos> Catch me, I'm falling down <eos> Don't stop, just keep going on <eos> I'm your shoulder, lean upon <eos> So come on, deliver from inside <eos> All we got is tonight, that is right 'till first light <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos> Is it real now? <eos> Two people become one <eos> I can feel it <eos> Two people become one <eos>

I saw Mommy kissin' Santa Claus <eos> Underneath the mistletoe last night <eos> She didn't see me creep <eos> Down the stairs to have a peep <eos> She thought that I was tucked up <eos> In my bedroom, fast asleep <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos>

By the darkest river <eos> Beneath the leafless trees <eos> I think I'm drowning <eos> This dream is killing me <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> In the coldest winter <eos> Between the fading lights <eos> I feel I'm falling into a frozen sky <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> Past the blackest heaven <eos> Above the dying stars <eos> I watch me breaking into a million shards <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> But through the hardest hour <eos> Below the cruelest sign <eos> I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> (Wake up, wake up) <eos> Wake up <eos> A depression fed by overload <eos> False perceptions, the weight of the world <eos> A universe in the palm of your hand <eos> The artifice of endless strands <eos> Distraction flows down an obsessive stream <eos> Rejection grows into oppressive screams <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> The regression of advancing modes <eos> And imperial corrosive nodes <eos> A prime directive to disconnect <eos> Reclaim yourself and resurrect <eos> Distraction flows down an obsessive stream <eos> Rejection grows into oppressive screams <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> There's too many choices <eos> And I hear their relentless voices <eos> But you've gotta run them out <eos> Return to now and shut it down <eos> Shut it down <eos> A depression fed by overload <eos> False perceptions, the weight of the world <eos> Because there's too many choices <eos> Gotta kill their relentless voices <eos> (Wake up, wake up) <eos> I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> Memento mori <eos> 
My mind's a leech, and I feel so weak <eos> My sleep was deep, and I did not dream <eos> There is a presence here, breathing life into our fears <eos> Russian roulette, the cylinder is full, no gods to interfere <eos> Requiem, this will destroy you <eos> Before you mourn the passing dream <eos> Requiem, this night won't conclude <eos> House of glass crashes down around you <eos> Spread of self-violence <eos> Complicit in silence <eos> Desire's subsidence <eos> Survive by dеfiance against defeat <eos> Burn it down <eos> Sweep of a nation misguidеd by a righteous hand <eos> Distorted divine <eos> Collective suicide <eos> Turbines aflame, like monolithic candles incandescent <eos> In a midnight aura, convulsing bodies in a ritual <eos> My sleep was deep, and I did not dream <eos> Burn it down, burn it down <eos> Pitch black mass <eos> House of glass <eos> Requiem, this will destroy you <eos> Before you mourn the passing dream <eos> Requiem, this night won't conclude <eos> House of glass crashes down around you <eos> Battered, battered and scarred <eos> Post-fundamentalist humiliation <eos> Scattered, scattered and starved <eos> Post-indoctrination <eos> Pitch black mass <eos> House of glass <eos> Burn, burn, burn it <eos> Burn, burn, burn it down <eos> Burn, burn it down <eos> This will destroy you <eos> Burn it down <eos> Burn it to the fucking ground <eos> 
There is hope for us <eos> There is distance between you and I <eos> We have just enough <eos> And it comes as no surprise <eos> I was in between <eos> You were matches and kerosene <eos> Is your conscience clear? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Did you celebrate without me? <eos> Did you tell them all about me? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Does it get you off <eos> To get it off your chest? <eos> Such an awful year <eos> Such an awful mess <eos> You can't write <eos> You can't sing <eos> You can't do anything at all <eos> Is there someone here? <eos> Can you make the call? <eos> Please, make the call <eos> And the ambulance is here <eos> And if I haven't made it clear... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Is there hope for us? <eos> There are constants that we can't define <eos> Is it all used up? <eos> Are we out of time? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> Well, if you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Now, the ambulance is here <eos> And if I still haven't made it clear <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> 
Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah <eos> About your summer last night <eos> Ain't give you no play, mm <eos> Could I make you shive last night? <eos> Could I make you shy on the last night, last night? <eos> Could we make it in? Do we have time? <eos> I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight <eos> Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white <eos> You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life <eos> Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice <eos> And our time was right <eos> Keep a place for me, for me <eos> I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing <eos> It's nothing, it's nothing <eos> Keep a place for me, for me <eos> Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry <eos> Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes <eos> I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO <eos> That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control <eos> And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control <eos> Keep a place for me, for me <eos> I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing <eos> Keep a place for me <eos> It's no thing, it's nothing <eos> It's no thing, it's nothing <eos> Sometimes you'll miss it <eos> And the sound will make you cry <eos> And some nights you're dancing <eos> With tears in your eyes <eos> I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave <eos> Take down some summer time <eos> Give up, just tonight, night, night <eos> I, I, I know you got someone comin' <eos> You're spittin' game, know you got it <eos> I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave <eos> Take down some summer time <eos> Give up, just tonight, night, night <eos> I, I, I know you got someone comin' <eos> You're spittin' game, know you got it <eos> (Nobody else, nobody else) <eos> I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave <eos> Take down some summer time <eos> Give up, just tonight, night, night <eos> I, I, I know you got someone comin' <eos> You're spittin' game, know you got it <eos> 
Remember when Hell had frozen over? <eos> The cold still burns underneath my skin <eos> The water is rising all around me <eos> And there is nothing left I can give <eos> All these tears I've shed <eos> I saw the wildfire spread <eos> You said you cheated death <eos> But Heaven was in my head <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> The embers still glow when I'm sober <eos> The gold in the flame burns brighter now <eos> I have to rebuild, now it's over <eos> Maybe now I'm lost, I can live <eos> Souls don't break, they bend <eos> But I sometimes forget <eos> I have to do this for you <eos> And the only way out is through <eos> Yeah, death is an open door <eos> Words the prophets said <eos> Still swimming through my head <eos> Now there's no stars left in the sky <eos> 'Cause this well will never run dry <eos> What if I completely forget? <eos> What if I never accept? <eos> 'Cause when you fade away <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> Yeah <eos> They say "the good die young" <eos> No use in saying "what is done is done" 'cause it's not enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> What will be will be <eos> Every river flows into the sea, but it's never enough <eos> And when the night gives way <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos> No matter what they say <eos> It's like a brand new doomsday <eos>

Hoy el sol se escondió y no quiso salir <eos> Te vio despertar y le dio miedo de morir <eos> Abriste los ojos y el sol guardó su pincel <eos> Porque tú pintas el paisaje mejor que él <eos> Cuando amanece tu lindura <eos> Cualquier constelación se pone insegura <eos> Tu belleza huele a mañana <eos> Y me da de comer durante toda la semana <eos> Tus ojos hacen magia, son magos <eos> Los abriste, y ahora se reflejan las montañas en los lagos <eos> La única verdad absoluta <eos> Es que cuando naciste tú a los árboles le nacieron frutas <eos> Naranja dulce siembra de querubes <eos> Como el sol tenía miedo se escondió en una nube <eos> Hoy el sol no hace falta, está en receso <eos> La vitamina D me la das tú con un beso <eos> La luna sale a caminar siguiendo tus pupilas <eos> La noche brilla original después que tú la miras <eos> Ya nadie sabe ser feliz a costa del despojo <eos> Gracias a ti y a tus ojos <eos> Eres un verso en riversa, un riverso <eos> Despertaste y le diste vuelta mi universo <eos> Ahora se llega a la cima bajando por la sierra <eos> La Tierra ya no gira, tú giras por la Tierra <eos> En la guerra se dan besos, ya no se pelean <eos> Hoy, las gallinas mugen y las vacas cacarean <eos> Las lombrices y los peces pescan los anzuelos <eos> Se vuela por el mar y se navega por el cielo <eos> Crecen flores en la arena, cae lluvia en el desierto <eos> Ahora los sueños son reales porque se sueña despierto <eos> Y ése sueño es seguro y así se reproduce <eos> Y la inocencia por fin no se esconde de las luces <eos> La escasez de comida se vuelve deliciosa <eos> Porque tenemos la barriga llena de mariposas <eos> La galaxia revela su comarca escondida <eos> Y en la Tierra parece que comienza la vida <eos> La luna sale a caminar siguiendo tus pupilas <eos> La noche brilla original después que tú la miras <eos> Ya nadie sabe ser feliz a costa del despojo <eos> Gracias a ti y a tus ojos <eos> Y en la academia militar enseñan medicina <eos> Y los banqueros ahora harán viviendas y comida <eos> Ya nadie sabe ser feliz a costa del despojo <eos> Gracias a ti y a tus ojos <eos>

I'm down and out, I'm on my knees <eos> Been working so hard to fill my needs <eos> 'Cause I got bitten by a hand that feeds <eos> And I'm burning cash like gasoline <eos> I'm back to the grind <eos> All I wanted to say <eos> Is I've been walking this line too long <eos> And all I wanted to say <eos> You know time has come, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone <eos> I got no shelter in the driving rain <eos> I got no lady to ease my pain <eos> I've got an empty bottle with an empty glass <eos> Could somebody please just make this pass <eos> I'm back to the grind, yeah <eos> And all I wanted to say <eos> Is I've been walking this line too long <eos> And all I wanted to say <eos> You know the time has come, so don't miss me when I'm gone <eos> And all I wanted to say <eos> Is I've been walking this line for too long <eos> And all I wanted to say <eos> You know the time has come, so don't miss me when I'm gone <eos> No, don't miss me when I'm gone <eos> 'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone <eos> No, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no <eos> Don't miss me when I'm gone <eos> 
Night of wonder <eos> Still and silent <eos> Heaven's brilliance from above <eos> Light of glory <eos> Pierced the darkness <eos> Mercy pierced my heart with love <eos> This is Jesus <eos> King of glory <eos> Here to rescue from the fall <eos> Son of God who <eos> Comes to save us <eos> Prince of peace and Lord of all <eos> Oh the mystery <eos> Who could fathom <eos> God would leave His Holy throne <eos> For a manger <eos> For a sinner <eos> For us all to be His own <eos> This is Jesus <eos> King of glory <eos> Here to rescue from the fall <eos> Son of God who <eos> Comes to save us <eos> Prince of peace and Lord of all <eos> Rejoice He is with us <eos> Rejoice hope is here <eos> Rejoice He is with us <eos> Rejoice hope is here <eos> Rejoice He is with us <eos> Rejoice hope is here <eos> Rejoice He is with us <eos> Rejoice hope is here <eos> This is Jesus <eos> King of glory <eos> Here to rescue from the fall <eos> Son of God who <eos> Comes to save us <eos> Prince of peace and Lord of all <eos> For the hearts so <eos> Prone to wander <eos> For these feet so quick to flee <eos> God is here and <eos> Love is reaching <eos> For the lost and least of these <eos>

I'm gonna fight 'em off <eos> A seven nation army couldn't hold me back <eos> They're gonna rip it off <eos> Taking their time right behind my back <eos> And I'm talking to myself at night <eos> Because I can't forget <eos> Back and forth through my mind <eos> Behind a cigarette <eos> And the message coming from my eyes <eos> Says "Leave it alone" <eos> Don't want to hear about it <eos> Every single one's got a story to tell <eos> Everyone knows about it <eos> From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell <eos> And if I catch it coming back my way <eos> I'm gonna serve it to you <eos> And that ain't what you want to hear <eos> But that's what I'll do <eos> And the feeling coming from my bones <eos> Says "Find a home" <eos> I'm going to Wichita <eos> Far from this opera forevermore <eos> I'm gonna work the straw <eos> Make the sweat drip out of every pore <eos> And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding <eos> Right before the Lord <eos> All the words are gonna bleed from me <eos> And I will sing no more <eos> And the stains coming from my blood <eos> Tell me "Go back home" <eos> 
9:05 in the evening, I'm all up in my feelings <eos> I'm callin' your phone 'cos I can't get enough <eos> And I got work in the morning, early, early in the morning <eos> But who needs sleep when we're lovin' it up? Oh <eos> And why'd I gotta do this the hard way? <eos> My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby <eos> Something I'll regret in the morning <eos> But I just can't resist when you're calling <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours <eos> That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours <eos> I got a bеd, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rathеr be in yours, yours <eos> That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours <eos> That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight <eos> (I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours) <eos> (I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours) <eos> 
When I was a boy I learned not to cry <eos> My daddy would scream <eos> I learned how to hide <eos> That fool cut off this ribbon of mine <eos> Leading me back before we unwind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> I learned how to do better each time <eos> I buried this heart and years went on by <eos> But what do you do when there's nothing inside? <eos> Lost in the dirt covered in vines <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> This bone will break along a line <eos> Been drawn for a long time <eos> Time <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos>

Me dices que te has vuelto a enamorar <eos> Y yo no te comprendo; lo que dices <eos> Si es que de mí te has olvidado ya <eos> O buscas otras horas más felices <eos> Supongo que es que tienes otro amor <eos> Y piensas colocarlo en mi lugar <eos> Creyendo que será mucho mejor <eos> Que todo lo que yo te he dado ya <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Tener otra ilusión día tras día <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Cambiar de ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo <eos> No puedo, no puedo vivir sin tu amor <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Cambiar de ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo <eos> No puedo, no puedo vivir sin tu amor <eos> Volver a enamorarse es acabar <eos> Con un amor que ya se ha terminado <eos> Tener quien ocupe ese lugar <eos> Que deja la reliquia de un pasado <eos> Si tú lo has conseguido, dímelo <eos> Que en nada yo me pienso interponer <eos> Si tienes quien te quiera más que yo <eos> Adiós, amor, y que te vaya bien <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Tener otra ilusión día tras día <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Cambiar de ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo <eos> No puedo, no puedo vivir sin tu amor <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Tener otra ilusión día tras día <eos> Casi te envidio <eos> Porque a mí también me gustaría <eos> Cambiar de ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo <eos> No puedo, no puedo vivir sin tu amor <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo vivir sin tu amor <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Si acaso lo conseguiste, por favor, ven, dímelo, explícalo <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Si es que tienes nuevo amor, que te aproveche, disfrútalo <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Porque a mí me gustaría también cambiar de ilusión <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Yo sé que se va a gozar tanto como gocé yo <eos> Casi te envidio por tener otra ilusión <eos> Pero yo no puedo, no puedo, no puedo <eos> 
I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye <eos> I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time <eos> Everything is 3D blasphemy <eos> My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up <eos> This is not the way I pictured me <eos> I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? <eos> Something about this, so very wrong <eos> I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this <eos> Is it a dream or a memory? <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this? <eos> But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate <eos> I have sinned by just <eos> Making my mind up and taking your breath away <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye! <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> And it waits for you <eos> 
Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que nada de ayer hoy te hace llorar <eos> Tú con él <eos> El tiempo corre, yo te espero, pero tú con él <eos> Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Estás tranquila, lo mereces, siempre fuiste bien <eos> Tú con él <eos> No me sorprende, sospechaba terminar así <eos> Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Que tú podías, si querías vivir sin su amor <eos> Perdóname <eos> No me di cuenta de ese juego y me enamoré <eos> Después fue tarde, no podía ya volver atrás <eos> Y te quería cada día más y más <eos> Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que puedes hacer lo que quieras tú <eos> Tú con él <eos> Ya me han contado que estás linda, mucho más que ayer <eos> Que no me odias y preguntas siempre algo de mí <eos> Al fin y al cabo un poquito yo me hice querer <eos> Disculpame <eos> Aquellos celos tan intensos que senti por ti <eos> Estaba loco, casi loco, por aquel amor <eos> Y al poco tiempo para siempre lo perdí <eos> Tú con él Aún recuerdo el romance que viviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Yo sé que jugaste con mis sentimientos <eos> Tú con él Todo fue un juego que tuviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Pero en ese juego yo me enamoré <eos> Tú con él Yo no me di cuenta, escucha mujer <eos> Tú con él Pero te lo juro, mamita, desperté <eos> Tú con él Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Tú con él Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Tú con él Que tú podías, si te querías vivir sin él <eos> Tú con él En el juego del amor, unos vienen y otros van <eos>

Quand'è che spento il cuore? <eos> Che ho smesso di sognare <eos> Un nuovo amore? <eos> Il dubbio dentro me <eos> E ho smesso di sperare <eos> Ma a un tratto, tu <eos> Risvegli nel profondo <eos> Un fuoco che mi accende <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and resterò <eos> Per costruire un sogno <eos> One more time <eos> Who cares about the past? <eos> Who knows about tomorrow? <eos> L'amore è adesso <eos> And maybe this won't last <eos> Maybe this moment's all we have <eos> Let's find out <eos> And though I'm still afraid <eos> You're worth a leap of faith <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> To see the world that we make <eos> I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> As if my heart cannot break <eos> One more time <eos> Here and now, up against the edge <eos> Promise me you won't look down <eos> Won't fall off the ledge <eos> Take my hand and show me how to love again <eos> And I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> Per costruire ancora <eos> One more time <eos> 
Been there, done that, messed around <eos> I’m having fun, don’t put me down <eos> I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet <eos> I won’t let you in again <eos> The messages I’ve tried to send <eos> My information’s just not going in <eos> Burning bridges shore to shore <eos> I break away from something more <eos> I’m not turned on to love until it’s cheap <eos> Been there, done that, messed around <eos> I’m having fun, don’t put me down <eos> I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> I won’t let you turn around <eos> And tell me now I’m much too proud <eos> To walk away from something when it’s dead <eos> Do-do-do your dirty words <eos> Come out to play when you are hurt? <eos> There’s certain things that should be left unsaid <eos> Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch <eos> And life’s too short for me to stop <eos> Oh, baby, your time is running out <eos> I won’t let you turn around <eos> And tell me now I’m much too proud <eos> All you do is fill me up with doubt <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> (This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time) <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> (This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time) <eos> 
In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come?

She played tambourine with a silver jingle <eos> And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes <eos> But the one most requested by the man she knew as cowboy <eos> Was the late night benediction at the y'all come back saloon <eos> In a voice soft and trembling <eos> She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled round her raven hair <eos> And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders <eos> Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo <eos> He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love <eos> Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song <eos> He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos>

I heard the bells on Christmas day <eos> Their old familiar carols play <eos> And wild and sweet the words repeat <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> I thought how, as the day had come <eos> The belfries of all Christendom <eos> Had rolled along the unbroken song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> And in despair I bowed my head: <eos> “There is no peace on earth, ” I said <eos> “For hate is strong and mocks the song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos> Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: <eos> “God is not dead, nor does he sleep; <eos> The wrong shall fail, the right prevail <eos> With peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos>

Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos> Si este amor fuera imposible <eos> Un deseo, un delirio intangible <eos> Viviría en la rutina de vivir <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si el amor no es el remedio <eos> Para que esta el corazón en el pecho <eos> Para que existen las rosas y el jardín <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos>

Like Elvis, like everyone <eos> We all die, we all live on in photos <eos> And paperbacks, if we're lucky <eos> We're coming back <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos> We notice <eos> We understand <eos> We throw out all we can <eos> We're on the market, we're up on racks <eos> If we're really lucky we're coming back <eos> I would never decide <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos> 
How do I get through one night without you? <eos> If I had to live without you <eos> What kind of life would that be? <eos> Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold <eos> You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave <eos> Baby, you would take away everything good in my life <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go? <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky <eos> There would be no love in my life <eos> There'd be no world left for me <eos> And I, baby, I don't know what I would do <eos> I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave <eos> Baby, you would take away everything real in my life <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go? <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> Please, tell me, baby <eos> How do I go on if you ever leave? <eos> Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me <eos> Baby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life? <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> How do I live without you? <eos> How do I live without you, baby? <eos> How do I live? <eos> 
Well, I met you at the blood bank <eos> We were looking at the bags <eos> Wondering if any of the colors <eos> Matched any of the names we knew on the tags <eos> You said "See, look it, that's yours <eos> Stacked on top with your brother's <eos> See how they resemble one another's <eos> Even in their plastic little covers?" <eos> And I said I know it well <eos> That secret that you know <eos> That you don't know how to tell <eos> It fucks with your honor <eos> And it teases your head <eos> But you know that it's good, girl <eos> 'Cause it's running you with red <eos> Then the snow started falling <eos> We were stuck out in your car <eos> You were rubbing both my hands <eos> Chewing on a candy bar <eos> You said "Ain't this just like the present <eos> To be showing up like this?" <eos> As the moon waned to crescent <eos> We started to kiss <eos> And I said I know it well <eos> That secret that we know <eos> That we don't know how to tell <eos> I'm in love with your honor <eos> I'm in love with your cheeks <eos> What's that noise up the stairs, babe? <eos> Is that Christmas morning creaks? <eos> And I know it well <eos> I know it well <eos> And I know it well <eos> I know it well <eos> And I know it well <eos> I know it well <eos> And I know it well <eos> I know it well <eos> 
Have you ever felt like you just couldn't be yourself <eos> Like it'd be easier if you were someone else <eos> Is there a voice inside your mind <eos> That reminds you all the time <eos> The ways you're broken <eos> Has it left you hopeless? <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never be enough <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never measure up <eos> Are you just trying to escape? <eos> Trying to run from all the pain <eos> Of being human <eos> Can you make it through it? <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos>

Son las cinco de la mañana <eos> Escuché que te levantabas <eos> Se cierra la puerta y ya sé que <eos> Me quedé solo otra vez <eos> No pasa nada <eos> El amor antes no importaba <eos> Pero hay algo que siento esta vez <eos> Y sé que mañana voy a querer <eos> Llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> No sé lo que puedas pensar <eos> Que te quеdes a dormir, pero hasta la mañana <eos> Que еsta vez no te vayas en medio de la madrugada <eos> Que te queda tan bonito el amanecer en la cara <eos> Te ves tan linda con eso, pero mejor sin nada <eos> Y marco tu número <eos> Que nunca voy a olvidar <eos> Tu voz sabrosa me tiene loco <eos> Que marco un cinco y me vuelvo un ocho <eos> Y marco tu número <eos> Que nunca voy a olvidar <eos> No le des a rechazar, ni se te ocurra <eos> Que no me voy a tardar en <eos> Llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> No sé lo que puedas pensar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar (me empezaste a gustar) <eos> Voy a querer llamarte (oh, no) <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> Que siempre te vas <eos> Son las cinco de la mañana <eos> Escuché que te levantabas <eos> Se cierra la puerta y ya sé que <eos> Me quedé solo otra vez <eos>

Antes no creía que de verdad existiera alguien así como tú <eos> Bendito el día en el que te encontré <eos> Juro que de dónde estés algo de mí te llevarás también <eos> No habrá camino que camine si tú no estás en él <eos> ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que entiendas <eos> Que me deslumbras, que eres perfecta, que no hay ninguna? <eos> Si se pudiera devolver el tiempo <eos> Yo no lo haría porque a ti te tengo <eos> Solo tú me complementas, no tengo dudas <eos> Sin darme cuenta le diste cura a la soledad que me mataba <eos> Tú me diste lo que me faltaba <eos> No sé ni cómo explicar lo que yo siento por ti <eos> Eres tan fundamental, en mi vida tan crucial <eos> Y no quiero imaginar tan solo un día sin ti <eos> Tus besos se volvieron necesarios <eos> Eres la luz que de la nada salió <eos> La verdad no dimensiono <eos> Estar sin ti, por eso te menciono <eos> Cada ve' que no te veo, a tu piel me direcciono <eos> Tan solo al verte me apasiono <eos> Tú me besa' y yo siento cómo me saca' de la capa de ozono <eos> Bebé, tus besos son como una puesta a otra dimensión <eos> Yo que pensaba que era un loco por ahí sin dirección <eos> Pero di con tu ubicación y me quedé en tu corazón (Uh yeah) <eos> La dueña de mi cora eres tú (Uh-uh-uh-uh) <eos> Nadie me lo hace como tú (Uh-uh-uh-uh) <eos> Tú tienes algo que me atrapa <eos> Ninguna llega a tu nivel por má' que tratan <eos> ¿Cómo puedo hacer para que entiendas <eos> Que me deslumbras, que eres perfecta, que no hay ninguna? <eos> Si se pudiera devolver el tiempo <eos> Yo no lo haría porque a ti te tengo <eos> Solo tú me complementas, no tengo dudas <eos> Sin darme cuenta le diste cura <eos> A la soledad que me mataba <eos> Tú me diste lo que me faltaba <eos> No sé ni cómo explicar lo que yo siento por ti <eos> Eres tan fundamental, en mi vida tan crucial <eos> Y no quiero imaginar tan solo un día sin ti <eos> Tus besos se volvieron necesarios <eos> Eres la luz que de la nada salió <eos> Jajajajaja (¿Cómo puedo hacer para que entiendas?) <eos> Maluma, baby <eos> (¿Que me deslumbras, que eres perfecta, que no hay ninguna?) <eos> Dímelo, Reik <eos> Esta combi no falla, ¿okey?

Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Mi querida <eos> Madre mía, yo recuerdo <eos> Madre mía, tu cabello como cataratas <eos> Madre mía, tus labios colorados de un rojo sangriento <eos> Madre mía, tus tacones se anunciaban <eos> Madre mía, martillazos se escuchaban por los pasillos <eos> Madre mía, enfrentemos a los hechos <eos> Madre mía, el cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Yo recuerdo amenazas a cuchillo, riñas animales <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Yo no supe qué hacer <eos> Ante tus poderes descomunales <eos> Madre mía, yo he heredado tu abismo <eos> Madre mía, te perdono <eos> Fuiste más que suficiente <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, mi querida <eos> Madre mía, no quedan palabras por decir <eos> Yo aprendí tu idioma <eos> Pero aún me rehuso a hablarlo <eos> Me duele en el alma <eos> Me duele todo de mí <eos> La distancia no fue sino mi única opción, mi única opción <eos> Yo me siento convertir en ti <eos> Madre mía, qué ironía <eos> Madre mía, qué alegría <eos> Yo he heredado tus abismos descomunales <eos> El cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Hasta que lo hice yo <eos> Madre mía, celestial <eos> Eres para siempre, para siempre <eos> Madre mía <eos> Mi origen y mi fin <eos> 
(It's a matter of time) <eos> (It's a matter of time) <eos> It’s exhausting trying to understand <eos> (Your intentions and your master plan) <eos> I’m running a race that I can’t win <eos> (I can't win) 'Cause I’m on eggshells with every step <eos> The sands of time are running low <eos> (Revolution's coming for you) <eos> Once they’re gone, watch this unfold <eos> The iron’s hot if you’re ready or not <eos> (We’ll strike!) You’ll learn you’re not immune <eos> It’s a matter of time 'til you face your crimes <eos> (You’ll find!) Your numbered days are few <eos> You can only run so far <eos> Until your heart caves in (Ooh-ooh-ah) <eos> 'Cause once the truth comes out <eos> You’ll learn who are your real friends <eos> The sands of time are running low <eos> (Revolution's coming for you) <eos> Once they’re gone, watch this unfold <eos> The iron’s hot if you’re ready or not <eos> (We’ll strike!)

Hit that, hit that snare <eos> I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top <eos> She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock <eos> It's a matter of time before we all run out <eos> When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth <eos> I waited eight long months, she finally set him free <eos> I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me <eos> Two weeks and we caught on fire <eos> She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile <eos> Whoa, I never meant to brag <eos> But I got him where I want him now <eos> Whoa, it was never my intention to brag <eos> To steal it all away from you now <eos> But God, does it feel so good <eos> 'Cause I got him where I want him now <eos> And if you could, then you know you would <eos> 'Cause God, it just feels so <eos> It just feels so good <eos> Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change <eos> Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change <eos> And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged <eos> I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way <eos> Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you <eos> Looking as innocent as possible to get to who <eos> They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right <eos> Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse! <eos> Whoa, I never meant to brag <eos> But I got him where I want him now <eos> Whoa, it was never my intention to brag <eos> To steal it all away from you now <eos> But God, does it feel so good <eos> 'Cause I got him where I want him right now <eos> And if you could, then you know you would <eos> 'Cause God, it just feels so <eos> It just feels so good <eos> I watched his wildest dreams come true <eos> And not one of them involving you <eos> Just watch my wildest dreams come true <eos> Not one of them involving <eos> Whoa, I never meant to brag <eos> But I got him where I want him now <eos> Whoa, I never meant to brag <eos> But I got him where I want him now <eos> Whoa, it was never my intention to brag <eos> To steal it all away from you now <eos> But God, does it feel so good <eos> 'Cause I got him where I want him now <eos> And if you could, then you know you would <eos> 'Cause God, it just feels so <eos> It just feels so good <eos> 
I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on <eos> I have screamed until my veins collapsed <eos> I've waited as my time's elapsed <eos> Now all I do is live with so much fate <eos> I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <eos> I've left behind this little fact <eos> You cannot kill what you did not create <eos> I've gotta say what I've gotta say <eos> And then I swear I'll go away <eos> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <eos> I guess I'll save the best for last <eos> My future seems like one big past <eos> You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <eos> Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone <eos> Tell me the reality is better than the dream <eos> But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> 
"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me" <eos> You're laying waste to Halloween <eos> You fucked it, friend, it's on its head, it struck the street <eos> You're in Milwaukee, off your feet <eos> And at once, I knew <eos> I was not magnificent <eos> Strayed above the highway aisle <eos> Jagged vacance, thick with ice <eos> I could see for miles, miles, miles <eos> Third and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway <eos> Was where we learned to celebrate <eos> Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me <eos> That night you played me "Lip Parade" <eos> Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree <eos> Saying nothing, that's enough for me <eos> And at once, I knew <eos> I was not magnificent <eos> Hulled far from the highway aisle <eos> Jagged vacance, thick with ice <eos> I could see for miles, miles, miles <eos> Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright <eos> Above my brother, I, and tangled spines <eos> We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be <eos> Now, to know it in my memory <eos> And at once, I knew <eos> I was not magnificent <eos> High above the highway aisle <eos> Jagged vacance, thick with ice <eos> I could see for miles, miles, miles <eos> 
And I'd give up forever to touch you <eos> 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow <eos> You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be <eos> And I don't wanna go home right now <eos> And all I can taste is this moment <eos> And all I can breathe is your life <eos> And sooner or later, it's over <eos> I just don't wanna miss you tonight <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming <eos> Or the moment of truth in your lies <eos> When everything feels like the movies <eos> Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> 
Oh! <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> Way too many heads, need a steady view <eos> Smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous <eos> Never meant to cross you <eos> But my jaw hit the floor with the one, two <eos> Think I want you <eos> You say this ain't love, but it's still the same love <eos> Make love, anything to sate ya <eos> Don't be shy, you decide <eos> Say, can I make you mine? <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (If you say it's alright) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> (Ah) Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine (Ah) <eos> Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> No, oh, oh <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> His love never felt right (Ah) <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> (Don't lie, baby, don't lie) <eos> 
Last night I, I saw you standing <eos> And I started, started pretending <eos> That I knew you, and you knew me too <eos> And just like a Roni, you were too shy <eos> But you weren't the only, 'cause so was I <eos> And I dreamed of you ever since <eos> Now I build up my confidence <eos> Girl next, next time you come my way <eos> I'll know just what to say... <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> I started to write you letters <eos> But I wanted to be more clever <eos> I wanted to get down and sweet talk you <eos> Hey, baby <eos> But just like a baby, I could not talk <eos> And I tried to come closer, but could not walk <eos> And I think of it every night <eos> How I just could not get it right! Oh! <eos> If we ever come close again <eos> I'll know what I'll say then, yeah <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Oh, girl... <eos> One more chance with you again <eos> I will not let it go! <eos> Oh, please! Give me just one more chance for love, love, love, love <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk? <eos> I wanna talk to my baby <eos> Come on and talk to me baby <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> Girl, I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk? <eos> Come on and talk to me baby <eos> See I wanna know <eos> You better tell me your name baby <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos> I wanna know, I wanna know <eos> I want to know your name <eos> Can we talk for a minute? <eos>

Get your motor runnin' <eos> Head out on the highway <eos> Looking for adventure <eos> In whatever comes our way <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> I like smoke and lightnin' <eos> Heavy metal thunder <eos> Racing with the wind <eos> And the feeling that I'm under <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> Like a true nature's child <eos> We were born, born to be wild <eos> We can climb so high <eos> I never wanna die <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Get your motor runnin' <eos> Head out on the highway <eos> Looking for adventure <eos> In whatever comes our way <eos> Yeah, darlin', go and make it happen <eos> Take the world in a love embrace <eos> Fire all of your guns at once <eos> And explode into space <eos> Like a true nature's child <eos> We were born, born to be wild <eos> We can climb so high <eos> I never wanna die <eos> Born to be wild <eos> Born to be wild <eos> 
Choking back a Breezer on the patio <eos> Within earshot of that guy we knew <eos> Oh the Marian Keyes of it all <eos> Babe you rewriting everything I do <eos> Out the back it's freezing, yeah it's very cold <eos> So I switch it up and head inside <eos> Lock eyes with another adult woman <eos> I can tell is trying not to cry <eos> But I can't ignore it <eos> I can't let it go <eos> I hate that your friends hate me now <eos> I hate me on my own, own, own <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Bully, bully you said I'm a bully oh <eos> But I thought I was just helping? <eos> Yeah, I see what you mean now <eos> I'm mеan and I'm brutal and selfish <eos> I just spent sevеn hours looking at old pics of me <eos> Tryna pinpoint where the bitch began <eos> Somewhere after the Passion of Christ <eos> And before I had an Instagram <eos> Still can't ignore it <eos> I can't cut the cord <eos> Nah not like you have <eos> Now that you got bored <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> All you did was hurt yourself <eos> And let me take the blame <eos> I loved you like a mirror <eos> So I guess I've done the same <eos> I'd have saved you burning up inside an old grey tavern <eos> Save you burning up and burning out <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> Ah why'd I have to co-depend upon another old man <eos> I see how that has left me in the past <eos> I'd have saved you but you said that I don't really care for you <eos> 
Stuck on you <eos> I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> Needed a friend <eos> And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> Mighty glad you stayed <eos> I'm stuck on you <eos> Been a fool too long, I guess it's time for me to come on home <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> So hard to see <eos> That a woman like you could wait around for a man like me <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> Mighty glad you stayed <eos> Oh, I'm leaving on that midnight train tomorrow <eos> And I know just where I'm going <eos> I've packed up my troubles and I've thrown them all away <eos> 'Cause this time little darling <eos> I'm coming home to stay <eos> I'm stuck on you <eos> I've got this feeling down deep in my soul that I just can't lose <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> I needed a friend <eos> And the way I feel now, I guess I'll be with you 'til the end <eos> Guess I'm on my way <eos> I'm mighty glad you stayed <eos> 
One, two, three <eos> Turn it up <eos> Big wheels keep on turnin' <eos> Carry me home to see my kin <eos> Singin' songs about the southland <eos> I miss Alabamy once again <eos> And I think it's a sin, yes <eos> Well I heard Mr Young sing about her (Southern man) <eos> Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down <eos> Well, I hope Neil Young will remember <eos> A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Where the skies are so blue <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Lord, I'm coming home to you <eos> In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo! Boo! Boo!) <eos> Now we all did what we could do <eos> Now Watergate does not bother me <eos> Does your conscience bother you? <eos> Tell the truth <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Where the skies are so blue <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Lord, I'm coming home to you <eos> Here I come, Alabama <eos> (Ah-ah-ah, Alabama <eos> Ah-ah-ah, Alabama <eos> Ah-ah-ah, Alabama <eos> Ah-ah-ah, Alabama) <eos> Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers <eos> And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes, they do) <eos> Lord, they get me off so much <eos> They pick me up when I'm feeling blue <eos> Now how 'bout you? <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Where the skies are so blue <eos> Sweet home Alabama <eos> Lord, I'm coming home to you <eos> Sweet home Alabama (Oh, sweet home, baby) <eos> Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true) <eos> Sweet home Alabama (Lordy) <eos> Lord, I'm coming home to you (Yeah, yeah) <eos> Mont... Montgomery's got the answer <eos> 
Call you up in the middle of the night <eos> Like a firefly without a light <eos> You were there like a blowtorch burning <eos> I was a key that could use a little turning <eos> So tired that I couldn't even sleep <eos> So many secrets I couldn't keep <eos> Promised myself I wouldn't weep <eos> One more promise I couldn't keep <eos> It seems no one can help me now <eos> I'm in too deep <eos> There's no way out <eos> This time I have really led myself astray <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Can you help me remember how to smile? <eos> Make it somehow all seem worthwhile <eos> How on earth did I get so jaded? <eos> Life's mystery seems so faded <eos> I can go where no one else can go <eos> I know what no one else knows <eos> Here I am, just drowning in the rain <eos> With a ticket for a runaway train <eos> And everything seems cut and dry <eos> Day and night <eos> Earth and sky <eos> Somehow I just don't believe it <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Bought a ticket for a runaway train <eos> Like a madman laughing at the rain <eos> A little out of touch, a little insane <eos> It's just easier than dealing with the pain <eos> Runaway train never going back <eos> Wrong way on a one-way track <eos> Seems like I should be getting somewhere <eos> Somehow I'm neither here nor there <eos> Runaway train never coming back <eos> Runaway train tearing up the track <eos> Runaway train burning in my veins <eos> Runaway but it always seems the same <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos>

Quizás te puedas preguntar <eos> Qué le hace falta a esta noche blanca <eos> A nuestras vidas que ya han vivido tanto <eos> Que han visto mil colores de sábanas de seda <eos> Y cuando llueve te gusta caminar <eos> Vas abrazándome sin prisa aunque te mojes <eos> Amor mío, lo nuestro es como es <eos> Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada <eos> Estoy aquí, tan enamorado de ti <eos> Que la noche dura un poco más <eos> El grito de una ciudad <eos> Que ve nuestras caras la humedad <eos> Y te haré compañía más allá de la vida <eos> Yo te juro que arriba te amaré más <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> La mañana nos traerá un canto nuevo de pájaros alegres <eos> Amor mío, así es la vida juntos <eos> Dos locos de repente <eos> Sonriéndole a la gente que nos ve pasar <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos> Poco a poco el abrazo <eos> Boca a boca, despacio <eos> Aliento y suspiros tibios, anochecer <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos>

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen <eos> Said "don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one?" <eos> Who will dance on the floor in the round? <eos> She says I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round <eos> She said her name was Billie Jean, and she caused a scene <eos> Every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one <eos> Who will dance on the floor in the round? <eos> People always told me be careful what you do <eos> Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts <eos> Mother always told me be careful who you love <eos> Be careful what you do before the lie becomes the truth <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who said that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> For forty days and forty nights the law was on her side <eos> Who could can stand when she's in demand <eos> Her schemes and her plans <eos> 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round <eos> So take my strong advice <eos> And remember to always think twice <eos> Do think twice <eos> She told my baby that we danced till three <eos> And she looked at me, showed a photo of my baby crying <eos> His eyes were like mine <eos> 'Cause we dance on the floor in the round <eos> People always told me be careful what you do <eos> Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts <eos> Then she stood right by me, the smell of sweet perfume <eos> This happened much too soon, but she called me to her room <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who says that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son <eos> Billie Jean is not my lover <eos> She's just a girl who says that I am the one <eos> But the kid is not my son <eos> She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son <eos> So take my strong advice <eos> And remember to always think twice <eos> Do think twice <eos>

Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it) <eos> I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side <eos> You can love it (You can love it) <eos> Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it) <eos> Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right <eos> Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand <eos> While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand <eos> And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained <eos> 'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain <eos> There's no denying it, you've never had control <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave) <eos> It doesn't matter how much money I get paid <eos> I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did) <eos> So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin <eos> If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear? <eos> Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear? <eos> If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere? <eos> 'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear <eos> There's no denying it, I've always had control <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> (Inside out) <eos> How you've turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> How you've turned me inside out <eos> I'm inside out <eos> So inside out <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> Inside out <eos>

Paper bags and plastic hearts <eos> All are belongings in shopping carts <eos> It's goodbye <eos> But we got one more night <eos> Lets get drunk and ride around <eos> And make peace with an empty town <eos> We can make it right <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> Tonight will change our lives <eos> It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry <eos> We won't give up the fight <eos> We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs <eos> And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young <eos> And we'll feel so alive <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> All of the wasted time <eos> The hours that were left behind me <eos> Answers that we'll never find <eos> They don't mean a thing tonight <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos>

Hey, where did we go? <eos> Days when the rains came <eos> Down in the hollow <eos> Playin' a new game <eos> Laughing and a running, hey, hey <eos> Skipping and a jumping <eos> In the misty morning fog with <eos> Our hearts a thumpin' and you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Whatever happened <eos> To Tuesday and so slow? <eos> Going down the old mine <eos> With a transistor radio <eos> Standing in the sunlight laughing <eos> Hiding behind a rainbow's wall <eos> Slipping and sliding <eos> All along the waterfall, with you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Do you remember when we used to sing <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da <eos> Just like that <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> So hard to find my way <eos> Now that I'm all on my own <eos> I saw you just the other day <eos> My, how you have grown <eos> Cast my memory back there, Lord <eos> Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout <eos> Making love in the green grass <eos> Behind the stadium with you <eos> My brown-eyed girl <eos> You, my brown-eyed girl <eos> Do you remember when we used to sing <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da la te da <eos> 
It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Stuck here <eos> Stuck here in these waters <eos> So sick to my stomach <eos> Is anybody there? <eos> Red lights <eos> Red lights in the darkness <eos> Everyone's so heartless <eos> Does anybody care? <eos> It's so hard to explain <eos> With your heart in a cage <eos> Only whisper but you wanna shout <eos> 'Cause the second you wake <eos> Too much pressure to take <eos> Every part of you wants to cry out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> Mirror <eos> Mirror on the wall <eos> I don't see beautiful <eos> Staring back at me <eos> Watching <eos> Watching my heart bleed out <eos> Trying not to freak out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for all of us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> They don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> They don't know <eos> 
The way you look when you cry make me wanna confess to you <eos> The way you wear that dress, like it couldn't mean less to you <eos> And there's no reason, keeping secrets <eos> Maybe regret is a weakness <eos> But all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> Don't wanna come home late and make a mistake for you <eos> It's easier to let a heart wait than make a heart break for you <eos> I gave you pieces of my secrets like religion to believe in <eos> And all the jealous gods can burn me down and start again <eos> 'Cause you belong to somebody else <eos> And I didn't want to but I couldn't help it <eos> And I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else (Somebody else) <eos> I know it's wrong to call this sweet hell upon myself <eos> You belong to somebody else, somebody else <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh (Make a heart break for you) <eos> Somebody else <eos> Oh, yeah, yeah <eos> 
Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Here's a little something <eos> I was born as a bastard, no father, no master <eos> A shadow in silence left searching for answers <eos> Put up for adoption and left with no option <eos> Another kid fostered to fester, forgotten <eos> Take a look into these desperate eyes <eos> As they’re cast into the wretched hive <eos> But I ain’t going down alone <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Lemme say this <eos> Now I stand as a father, to men with no honor <eos> Ashamed of the racists I used to call brothers <eos> 'Cause no flag can mean bravery <eos> When bloodied by slavery <eos> The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior <eos> And the sickening feeling in the air <eos> Is the fear to speak that no one dares <eos> So will I stand here all alone? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Live my life like I’ll die tonight <eos> Dream like I’ll live forever <eos> Live my life like I’ll die tonight <eos> Dream like I’ll live forever <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> I have roared at the world for years <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> Doesn’t anybody hear me? <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> This burden suffered, I’ve paid the cost <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> Not all who wander are lost <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> 
Vacate is the word <eos> Vengeance has no place in me to hurt <eos> Cannot find the comfort in this world <eos> Artificial tears <eos> Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers? <eos> Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere <eos> A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto <eos> But there's a trapdoor in the sun <eos> It's immortality… <eos> As privileged as a whore <eos> Victims in demand for public show <eos> Swept out through the cracks beneath the door <eos> Holier than thou, how? <eos> Surrendered, executed, anyhow… <eos> Scrawl resolved, cigar box on the floor <eos> A truant finds home and a wish to hold onto <eos> There's a trapdoor in the sun <eos> It's immortality... <eos> I cannot stop the thought running in the dark <eos> Coming up a which way sign <eos> All good truants must decide <eos> Oh, stripped and sold, mom… <eos> Auctioned forearm and whiskers in the sink <eos> Truant moves on, cannot stay long <eos> Some die just to live… <eos> Oh… <eos>

Sitting at the stoplight <eos> He can't be bothered by the heart cry <eos> Written on the cardboard in her hand <eos> But when she looks him in the eye <eos> His heart is broken open wide <eos> And he feels the hand of God reach out through him <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus, help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> There's silence at the table <eos> He wants to talk, but he's not able <eos> For all the shame that's locked him deep inside <eos> But her words are the medicine <eos> When she says they can begin again <eos> And forgiveness will set him free tonight <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> I said, God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos>

I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> I can feel that <eos> Muddy water runnin' through my veins <eos> And I can hear that <eos> Lullaby of the midnight train <eos> And it sings to me and sounds familiar <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> I can taste that honeysuckle <eos> And it's still so sweet <eos> When it grows wild <eos> On the banks down at old Camp Creek <eos> Yeah, and it calls to me like a warm wind blowin' <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> It's where I learned about livin' <eos> It's where I learned about love <eos> It's where I learned about workin' hard <eos> And havin' a little was just enough <eos> It's where I learned about Jesus <eos> And knowin' where I stand <eos> You can take it or leave it <eos> This is me, this is who I am <eos> Give me a tin roof, a front porch and a gravel road <eos> And that is home to me, feels like home to me <eos> I feel no shame, I'm proud of where I came from <eos> I was born and raised in the boondocks <eos> One thing I know, no matter where I go <eos> I keep my heart and soul in the boondocks <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> You get a line, I'll get a pole <eos> We'll go fishin' in the crawfish hole <eos> Five card poker on Saturday night <eos> Church on Sunday mornin' <eos> 
(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To explain in due time all I know <eos> Time is a valuable thing <eos> Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <eos> Watch it count down to the end of the day <eos> The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal) <eos> Didn't look out below <eos> Watch the time go right out the window <eos> Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know <eos> I wasted it all just to watch you go <eos> I kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To remind myself how I tried so hard <eos> In spite of the way you were mockin' me <eos> Actin' like I was part of your property <eos> Rememberin' all the times you fought with me <eos> I'm surprised it got so far <eos> Things aren't the way they were before <eos> You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <eos> Not that you knew me back then <eos> But it all comes back to me in the end <eos> You kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos>

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <eos> Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife <eos> And if it was an open-shut case <eos> I never would've known from that look on your face <eos> Lost in your current like a priceless wine <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in <eos> As if you were a mythical thing <eos> Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <eos> And there was one prize I'd cheat to win <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> They count me out time and time again <eos> Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <eos> But I come back stronger than a '90s trend <eos> Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark <eos> Show me the places where the others gave you scars <eos> Now this is an open-shut case <eos> I guess I should've known from the look on your face <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> The more that you say, the less I know <eos> Wherever you stray, I follow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> You know that my train could take you home <eos> Anywhere else is hollow <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> That's my man <eos> Yeah, that's my man <eos> Every bait-and-switch was a work of art <eos> That's my man <eos> Hey, that's my man <eos> I'm begging for you to take my hand <eos> Wreck my plans, that's my man <eos>

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain <eos> I like watching the puddles gather rain <eos> And all I can do is just pour some tea for two <eos> And speak my point of view, but it's not sane <eos> It's not sane <eos> I just want someone to say to me <eos> "I'll always be there when you wake" <eos> You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today <eos> So stay with me and I'll have it made (I'll have it made) <eos> And I don't understand why I sleep all day <eos> And I start to complain that there's no rain <eos> And all I can do is read a book to stay awake <eos> And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape <eos> Escape <eos> Escape <eos> Escape <eos> All I can say is that my life is pretty plain <eos> You don't like my point of view <eos> You think that I'm insane <eos> It's not sane <eos> It's not sane <eos> I just want someone to say to me (no oh oh oh) <eos> "I'll always be there when you wake" <eos> (Y-yeah, yeah) <eos> You know, I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today <eos> So stay with me and I'll have it made <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Oh and I'll have it made <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> And I'll have it made <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Oh, lord oh no no <eos> You know I'm really <eos> I'm-a really gonna have it made <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Yeah, you know I'll have it made <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Ohh ohh oh ohh <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Ohh ohh oh ohh <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Ohh ohh oh ohh <eos> (I'll have it made) <eos> Ohh ohh oh ohhh, h, h, h, h, h, h <eos>

I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance <eos> I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands <eos> I've seen neon rebounds <eos> And late-night drunk dials <eos> I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke <eos> I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke <eos> The real thing won't be easy <eos> Yeah, might take a while <eos> But I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs <eos> And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there <eos> They had their share of ups and downs <eos> And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it <eos> To get to that that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I've had some real close calls <eos> A couple diamond ring thoughts <eos> And enough midnight tears to know what love's not <eos> I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Somebody like that <eos> Mmm, somebody like that <eos> Love somebody like that <eos> 
Fire is motion <eos> Work is repetition <eos> This is my document <eos> We are all, all we've done <eos> We are all, all we've done <eos> We are all, all we've done <eos> We are all, all defenses <eos> Fire is motion, is motion growth? <eos> And you are colder <eos> Than you could ever be <eos> And you are bolder <eos> Than buzzing bugs <eos> And you are colder <eos> Than you could ever be <eos> And you are bolder <eos> Than buzzing bugs <eos> My mama, my my mama said <eos> My cousin bucky's so boldly bald <eos> My cousin bucky never took his hat off <eos> He always kept his hair back <eos> My cousin bucky kept his hair back <eos> He kept that cap on <eos> Even when swimming <eos> Yeah, I know there's a lesson <eos> In there somewhere <eos> Something nothing <eos> Special about boys <eos> Who smell like salami <eos> And boys who've never apologized <eos> And you are colder <eos> Than you could ever be <eos> And you are bolder <eos> Than buzzing bugs <eos> 
Well, it's Sunday morning <eos> And the sun in shining in my eye that is open <eos> And my head is spinning <eos> Was the life of the party <eos> I can't stop grinning <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Now wait a minute <eos> Things don't look to familiar <eos> Who is this cowboy who's sleepin' beside me? <eos> He's awful cute <eos> But how'd I get his shirt on? <eos> I had to much tequila last night <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> All those little shooters <eos> How I love to drink 'em down <eos> Come on, bartender <eos> Let's have another round <eos> Well, the music is playing and my spirits are high <eos> Tomorrow might be painful <eos> But tonight we're gonna fly <eos> Did I start any fights? <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Every time we get together <eos> I sure have a good time <eos> You're my friend, you're the best, mi amigo <eos> (Tequila) <eos> Jose Cuervo <eos> You are a friend of mine <eos> I like to drink you with a little salt and lime <eos> Did I kiss all the cowboys? <eos> Did I shoot out the lights? <eos> Did I dance on the bar? <eos> Did I start a fight? <eos> Jose Cuervo, you are a friend of mine <eos>

You've got me stressed out <eos> I lied to my friends <eos> Yeah, when we hung out <eos> I broke promises <eos> Because I told them <eos> That I would never see you again, but then I saw you again <eos> Backwards and forwards and forwards and backwards <eos> I can't keep on falling back into your patterns <eos> You got me in your web, black widow in the bed <eos> Up and then down and side to side <eos> You cut me like you cut your lights <eos> I barely survived last time <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> Might overdose if <eos> We do this again <eos> Should be precocious <eos> But damn it I'm in deeper than I can <eos> Swim but here I am again, drowning in sin <eos> Backwards and forwards and forwards and backwards <eos> I can't keep on falling back into your patterns <eos> You got me in your web, black widow in the bed <eos> Up and then down and side to side <eos> You cut me like you cut your lights <eos> I barely survived last time <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> My friends say, they think you're so dangerous <eos> Devil in a dress, my god, you're so shameless <eos> My friends say, they think you're so dangerous <eos> Devil in a dress, my god, you're so shameless <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> 
I wanna see you without any clothes on <eos> That body's dangerous, not letting you to show it off <eos> Give it to me right, girl, can't go all night, girl <eos> I wanna see what you're made of <eos> (My boyfriend's gonna flip his shit) <eos> I won't tell, I won't tell and you won't either <eos> I know you know I do it better than he can <eos> I know that you know I do it better than he can <eos> Mm, mm, mm <eos> Mm, mm, mm <eos> Mm, mm, mm <eos> Mm, mm, mm <eos> That back needs breaking, I just say it like he would (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Do what you waited for <eos> Mm, mm, mm <eos> If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good <eos> They'd thank me if they could <eos> If these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good <eos> Better than he would, I'm sure <eos> I know you know I do it better than he can <eos> I know that you know I do it better than he can <eos> Henry, my boyfriend's gonna kill me <eos> You're lucky, you're cute <eos> 
You broke me first <eos> Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a while, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first (You broke me first) <eos> You broke me first, ooh oh <eos> 
I'm drunk off your kiss <eos> For another night in a row <eos> This is becoming too routine for me <eos> But I didn't mean to lead you on <eos> And it's alright to pretend <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for show, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Please tell me everything <eos> That you think that I should know <eos> About all the plans you made <eos> When I was nowhere to be found <eos> And it's alright to forget <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for fun, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> You need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> (Everything I wanted) <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back for you <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you! <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos>

I can't stop loving you so I've made up my mind <eos> To live in memories of old lonesome times <eos> I can't stop wanting you it's useless to say <eos> So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday <eos> Those happy hours that we once knew though long ago still make me blue <eos> They say that time heels the broken heart <eos> But time is stood still since we've been apart <eos> I can't stop loving you... <eos> 
I love little baby ducks, old pick-up trucks <eos> Slow movin' trains and rain <eos> I love little country streams, sleep without dreams <eos> Sunday school in May and hay <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends <eos> Birds of the world and squirrels <eos> I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups <eos> Bourbon in a glass and grass <eos> And I love you too <eos> I love honest open smiles, kisses from a child <eos> Tomatoes on the vine and onions <eos> I love winners when they cry, losers when they try <eos> Music when it's good and life <eos> And I love you too <eos> 
Karma police, arrest this man <eos> He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge <eos> He's like a detuned radio <eos> Karma police, arrest this girl <eos> Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill <eos> And we have crashed her party <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> Karma police, I've given all I can <eos> It's not enough, I've given all I can <eos> But we're still on the payroll <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> 
I've been walkin' these streets so long <eos> Singin' the same old song <eos> I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway <eos> Where hustle's the name of the game <eos> And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain <eos> There's been a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Well, I really don't mind the rain <eos> And a smile can hide all the pain <eos> But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way <eos> And I dream of the things I'll do <eos> With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe <eos> There'll be a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know <eos> 
"Son," she said, "have I got a little story for you <eos> What you thought was your daddy was nothing but a... <eos> While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen <eos> Your real daddy was dyin' <eos> Sorry you didn't see him, but I'm glad we talked" <eos> Oh, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, oh <eos> While she walks slowly across a young man's room <eos> She said, "I'm ready for you" <eos> Why I can't remember anything to this very day <eos> 'Cept the look, the look <eos> Oh, you know where, now I can't see I just stare <eos> I, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive, yeah <eos> Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh <eos> "Is something wrong", she said, of course there is <eos> "You're still alive," she said, oh, and do I deserve to be? <eos> Is that the question? <eos> And if so, if so who answers? <eos> Who answers? <eos> I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Hey, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Yeah, I, oh I'm still alive <eos> Yeah, I <eos> Ooh, I'm still alive! <eos> Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah! <eos> Ooh yeah, ooh ooh <eos> Ooh yeah, yeah yeah yeah <eos>
