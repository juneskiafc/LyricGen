Oh this perfume, must be something sacred <eos> To linger after you, like it do <eos> This scent's been buried where I rest my head <eos> Pretend to forget but it still feels like you <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Sleep much longer than I did before <eos> Though haunted are dreams evermore <eos> Bless these angels hanging over my head <eos> Still as a tomb though, I'm scared instead <eos> ('Cause) <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I thought I left you behind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> I must bе losing my mind <eos> I must be losing my mind <eos> Oh you left so much behind <eos> I must be losing my mind, Oh <eos> 
I sat by the ocean <eos> And drank a potion, baby, to erase you <eos> Face down in the boulevard <eos> Yet, I couldn't face you <eos> There ain't no use in crying <eos> It doesn't change anything <eos> So, baby, what good does it do? <eos> Your friends, they all sympathize <eos> Maybe I don’t need them to <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead, I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> There's nowhere to run away <eos> Said, "Boy, if you want love <eos> You'll have to go and find it with someone new <eos> Do you know who you really are <eos> Are you sure it's really you?" <eos> Lies are a funny thing <eos> They slip through your fingertips <eos> Because they never happened to you <eos> Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view <eos> Imagined I'd be your one and only <eos> Instead I'm the lonely one <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> You, me and a lie <eos> Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night <eos> Into the light, left with nowhere to hide <eos> Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night <eos>

Spinning around, spinning around <eos> Oh <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> Traded in my sorrow for some joy that I borrowed <eos> From back in the day <eos> Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe <eos> I got something to say <eos> I'm through with the past, ain't no point in looking back <eos> The future will be <eos> And did I forget to mention that I found a new direction <eos> And it leads back to me? <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> The mistakes that I've made have given me the strength <eos> To really believe <eos> And no matter how I take it, there's no way I'm gonna fake it <eos> 'Cause it's gotta be real <eos> I've got nothing left to hide, no reason left to fight <eos> 'Cause the truth's given me <eos> A new freedom inside, getting rid of my desire <eos> Do you like what you see? <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down, I'm not the same <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this (Ooh) <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> You know you like it like this <eos> Oh, baby, baby, baby <eos> You know you like it like this <eos> Oh, baby, baby, baby <eos> I'm spinning around, move out of my way <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> I'm breaking it down (I'm not the same) <eos> I'm not the same (I know you feel me) <eos> I know you're feeling me 'cause you like it like this <eos> Feel me 'cause you like it like this, oh <eos> I'm not the same <eos> I know you like it like this, oh <eos> Ooh yeah, like it like this, like it like this <eos> I'm not the same, like it like this <eos> I'm not the same, I'm not the same, oh <eos>

We've been to both Carolinas <eos> Seen a big Montana sky <eos> Driven up and down a coast a few times <eos> London, Paris, paradise <eos> But ain't got much memory of the scenes <eos> Come to think, I miss them all <eos> And damn, babe, it's all your fault <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach? <eos> You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea <eos> And the night rolled in <eos> And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall <eos> But God, I saw all I needed to <eos> Might as well have stayed in the room <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Don't you remember Times Square? <eos> And people counting down everywhere <eos> 2000-whatever, no, I didn't care <eos> 'Cause baby you were there <eos> And once again, couldn't help but stare <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> Halfway around the world <eos> Or the local corner booth <eos> Yeah, you guessed it, girl <eos> You know I got my eyes on you <eos> We could be on any street <eos> Any party, any room <eos> I'll be there all night with my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> 
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem <eos> You love me no longer, I know and <eos> Maybe there is nothing that I can do <eos> To make you do <eos> Mama tells me I shouldn't bother <eos> That I ought just to stick to another man <eos> A man that surely deserves me <eos> But I think you do <eos> So I cry, and I pray, and I beg <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Pretend that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> So I cry and I beg for you to <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos> Lately I have desperately pondered <eos> Spent my nights awake and I wonder <eos> What I could have done in another way <eos> To make you stay <eos> Reason will not lead to solution <eos> I will end up lost in confusion <eos> I don't care if you really care <eos> As long as you don't go <eos> So I cry, and I pray, and I beg <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Pretend that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> So I cry and I beg for you to <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Leave me, leave me <eos> Just say that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos> (Anything but you) <eos> Love me, love me <eos> Say that you love me <eos> Fool me, fool me <eos> Go on and fool me <eos> Love me, love me <eos> I know that you need me <eos> I can't care about anything but you <eos>

Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> 
What would I do without your smart mouth? <eos> Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out <eos> You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin' <eos> I can't pin you down <eos> What's goin' on in that beautiful mind? <eos> I'm on your magical mystery ride <eos> And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me <eos> But I'll be alright <eos> My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine <eos> You're crazy and I'm out of my mind <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> How many times do I have to tell you? <eos> Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too <eos> The world is beating you down, I'm around <eos> Through every mood <eos> You're my downfall, you're my muse <eos> My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues <eos> I can't stop singing, it's ringing <eos> In my head for you <eos> My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine <eos> You're crazy and I'm out of my mind <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> Give me all of you, oh <eos> Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts <eos> Risking it all, though it's hard <eos> 'Cause all of me <eos> Loves all of you <eos> Love your curves and all your edges <eos> All your perfect imperfections <eos> Give your all to me <eos> I'll give my all to you <eos> You're my end and my beginnin' <eos> Even when I lose, I'm winnin' <eos> 'Cause I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you <eos> I give you all of me <eos> And you give me all of you, oh-oh <eos> 
¿Por qué no te besé en el alma cuando aún podia? <eos> ¿Por qué no te abracé la vida cuando la tenía? <eos> Y yo que no me daba cuenta cuánto te dolía <eos> Y yo que no sabía el daño que me hacía <eos> Cómo es que nunca me fijé que ya no sonreias <eos> Y que antes de apagar la luz ya nada me decías <eos> Que a ti el amor se te escapó, que había llegado el día <eos> Que ya no me sentías, que ya ni te dolía <eos> Me dediqué a perderte <eos> Inocentes momentos que se han ido para siempre <eos> Me dediqué a no verte <eos> Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme <eos> Y me alejé mil veces y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre <eos> Y quise detenerte <eos> Y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente <eos> Me dediqué a perderte, me dediqué a perderte <eos> ¿Por qué no te llené de mi cuando aún había tiempo? <eos> ¿Por qué no pude comprender lo que a esta hora entiendo? <eos> Que fuiste todo para mi y que yo estaba ciego, te dejé para luego, este maldito ego <eos> Me dediqué a perderte <eos> Inocentes momentos que se han ido para siempre <eos> Me dediqué a no verte <eos> Y me encerré en mi mundo y no pudiste detenerme <eos> Y me alejé mil veces y cuando regresé te había perdido para siempre <eos> Y quise detenerte <eos> Y entonces descubrí que ya mirabas diferente <eos> Me dediqué a perderte, me dediqué a perderte <eos> 
And I've give up forever to touch you <eos> 'Cause I know that you'll feel me somehow <eos> You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be <eos> And I don't wanna go home right now <eos> And all I can taste is this moment <eos> And all I can breathe is your life <eos> And sooner or later, it's over <eos> I just don't wanna miss you tonight <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's meant to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming <eos> Or the moment of truth in your lies <eos> When everything feels like the movies <eos> Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's meant to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's meant to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> 
There's a stranger in my bed <eos> There's a pounding in my head <eos> Glitter all over the room <eos> Pink flamingos in the pool <eos> I smell like a minibar <eos> DJ's passed out in the yard <eos> Barbies on the barbeque <eos> This a hickey or a bruise? <eos> Pictures of last night ended up online <eos> I'm screwed, oh well <eos> It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled <eos> Damn <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> Trying to connect the dots <eos> Don't know what to tell my boss <eos> Think the city towed my car <eos> Chandelier is on the floor <eos> Ripped my favorite party dress <eos> Warrant's out for my arrest <eos> Think I need a ginger ale <eos> That was such an epic fail <eos> Pictures of last night ended up online <eos> I'm screwed, oh well <eos> It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled <eos> Damn <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again (Do it all again) <eos> This Friday night, do it all again <eos> (Do it all again) This Friday night <eos> T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F <eos> T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F., T.G.I.F <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we danced on tabletops <eos> And we took too many shots <eos> Think we kissed, but I forgot <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, we maxed our credit cards <eos> And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard <eos> Last Friday night <eos> We went streaking in the park <eos> Skinny dipping in the dark, then had a ménage à trois <eos> Last Friday night <eos> Yeah, I think we broke the law <eos> Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh whoa <eos> But this Friday night, do it all again <eos> 
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes <eos> But it's the only thing that I know <eos> When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes <eos> It is the only thing that makes us feel alive <eos> We keep this love in a photograph <eos> We made these memories for ourselves <eos> Where our eyes are never closing <eos> Our hearts were never broken <eos> And time's forever frozen, still <eos> So you can keep me <eos> Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans <eos> Holding me close until our eyes meet <eos> You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home <eos> Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul <eos> And it's the only thing that I know, know <eos> I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya <eos> And it's the only thing to take with us when we die <eos> We keep this love in a photograph <eos> We made these memories for ourselves <eos> Where our eyes are never closing <eos> Our hearts were never broken <eos> And time's forever frozen, still <eos> So you can keep me <eos> Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans <eos> Holding me close until our eyes meet <eos> You won't ever be alone <eos> And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby <eos> Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me <eos> And I won't ever let you go <eos> Wait for me to come home <eos> Wait for me to come home <eos> Wait for me to come home <eos> Wait for me to come home <eos> Oh, you can fit me <eos> Inside the necklace you got when you were 16 <eos> Next to your heartbeat where I should be <eos> Keep it deep within your soul <eos> And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby <eos> Only words bleed inside these pages <eos> You just hold me <eos> And I won't ever let you go <eos> When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me <eos> Under the lamppost back on Sixth street <eos> Hearing you whisper through the phone <eos> "Wait for me to come home" <eos> 
Home sweet <eos> Touching down, from a six night honeymoon <eos> Sun kissed kids, still drunk on love <eos> Went from, all-inclusive margaritas in Malibu <eos> To praying we could pay rent this month <eos> That doormat says "Welcome Home" <eos> But I think it's wherever I’m with you <eos> It's more than some bricks and stones <eos> No, there ain't nothing like <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain't nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet <eos> You and me <eos> Your love is like, a porch swing on Sunday <eos> Just as gentle as a summer sunrise <eos> They say "It's where the heart is", well, mine's with you, babe <eos> Long as I got your hand, I'm fine, yeah <eos> Could be white brick and picket fences <eos> Or some busted AC hotel room <eos> It's all picture perfect if you're in it <eos> No, it don't get much better than <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Ain’t got much but we got all we need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> A quarter acre and a two-bed farmhouse <eos> Polaroid kiss, with the red sold sign <eos> Sitting on boxes in the living room laughing and crying <eos> Just staring at them two pink lines, huh <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> Time to make a little more room in our <eos> Home sweet, you and me <eos> Yeah, we got it all and you're still all I need <eos> Wherever the wind blows <eos> Wherever this life goes <eos> Baby, all I know, ain’t nothing like, nothing like <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> You and me, yeah (Nothing like, nothing like) <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos> Nothing like, nothing like <eos>

Preparé el café como siempre <eos> El mismo desayuno de los viernes <eos> Y no estabas, tú no estabas <eos> Sé que prometí ser paciente <eos> ¿Pero qué le hago si me duele? <eos> La distancia nos tiene en pausa <eos> Solo sé bailar si tú bailas conmigo <eos> Todo está tan mal si yo no estoy contigo, contigo <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> De amor de amor <eos> Porque yo te extraño desde la' 9 a las 5 <eos> Yo te extraño viernes, sábado y domingo <eos> Dime cuándo llega' (Dime cuándo llega') <eos> Pa' recogerte con cartel y con globito (Hmm-mm) <eos> Yo ya no quiero dormir solito <eos> ¿De qué me sirven los 5 sentidos si no te tengo conmigo? <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (Avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor (Me muero de amor) <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor <eos> Me pregunto cuánto falta <eos> Entiende cuánto me haces falta <eos> Ya no quiero la distancia <eos> Ya devuélveme la calma <eos> Un, dos, tres de la mañana <eos> Y la cama que te extraña <eos> Me pregunta cuánto falta <eos> Para ver tu cara <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (El primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves, no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer, el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Que yo te extraño) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor (Me estoy muriendo lento, lento, lento) <eos> To' los días que no puedo vivir sin ti (Ay, lento, lento, lento) <eos> Me haces falta (Tanta falta) <eos> Ay, móntante en el avión y ven <eos> 
Ooh <eos> Balloons are deflated <eos> Guess they look lifeless like me <eos> We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm <eos> Still got your things here <eos> And they stare at me like souvenirs <eos> Don't wanna let you out my head <eos> Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever <eos> Said that you love me, but that'll last for never <eos> It's cold outside like when you walked out my life <eos> Why you walk out my life? <eos> I get like this every time <eos> On these days that feel like you and me <eos> Heartbreak anniversary <eos> 'Cause I remember every time <eos> On these days that feel like you and me <eos> Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me? <eos> (Oh-ooh) No <eos> (Ooh) No, no, no <eos> (Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh) <eos> I'm buildin' my hopes up <eos> Like presents unopened 'til this day <eos> I still see the messages you read, mmm <eos> I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient) <eos> Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips) <eos> Don't wanna let you out my head <eos> Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever <eos> Said that you love me but that'll last for never <eos> It's cold outside like when you walked out my life <eos> Why you walk out my life? (My life) <eos> I get like this every time <eos> On these days that feel like you and me <eos> Heartbreak anniversary <eos> 'Cause I remember every time <eos> On these days that feel like you and me <eos> Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me? <eos> (Oh-ooh) Of me <eos> (Ooh) 'Cause I think of you, think of you <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> 
Maybe you want to give me kisses sweet <eos> But only for one night with no repeat <eos> And maybe you'd go away and never call <eos> And a taste of honey is worse than none at all <eos> Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part <eos> That would only break my heart <eos> Oh, but if you feel like loving me <eos> If you got the notion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> Said, if you feel like giving me <eos> A lifetime of devotion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> Maybe you think that love would tie you down <eos> And you don't have the time to hang around <eos> Maybe you think that love was made for fools <eos> So it makes you wise to break the rules <eos> Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part <eos> That would only break my heart <eos> Oh, but if you feel like loving me <eos> If you got the notion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> Said, if you feel like giving me <eos> A lifetime of devotion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> Oh, little girl, in that case I don't want no part <eos> That would only break my heart <eos> Oh, but if you feel like loving me <eos> If you got the notion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> Said, if you feel like giving me <eos> A lifetime of devotion <eos> I second that emotion <eos> 
Que yo iba a lastimarte y que no me iba a quedar <eos> Que yo sería el culpable y que tú ibas a llorar <eos> No es cierto, no es cierto, no es cierto <eos> No hay nada más difícil que aprender a mentir <eos> Fingiendo que estoy vivo cuando voy a morir <eos> Por dentro, por dentro, por dentro <eos> Y todo es fácil para ti olvidar <eos> Yo nunca quise nada más <eos> Siempre fue muy tarde <eos> Me haces falta, amor <eos> Explícame qué te hizo falta, amor <eos> ¿Será todo eso que me falta, amor? <eos> Si lo único que me hace falta, amor, es ese amor que no me das <eos> ¿Por qué me obligas a dejarte atrás? <eos> ¿Por qué me obligas a sentir dolor? <eos> Si lo único que te hace falta, amor, es este amor <eos> Y yo la rabia empiezo a acumular <eos> No, el odio no puedo evitar <eos> Sólo espero que al final el amor no te falte <eos> Si yo lo encuentro en otra parte <eos> No quiero disimular, no quiero hablarte <eos> No quiero que al despertar quiera besarte <eos> Voy buscando una razón para olvidarte <eos> Y entre más lo intento, más me cuesta soltarte <eos> No, me duele el vacío que dejas por dentro <eos> Me duele inventarme falsos sentimientos <eos> ¿Cómo viviré con tanto sufrimiento? <eos> Me haces falta, amor <eos> Explícame qué te hizo falta, amor <eos> ¿Será todo eso que me falta, amor? <eos> Si lo único que me hace falta, amor, es ese amor que no me das <eos> ¿Por qué me obligas a dejarte atrás? <eos> ¿Por qué me obligas a sentir dolor? <eos> Si lo único que te hace falta, amor, es este amor <eos> Y yo la rabia empiezo a acumular <eos> No, el odio no puedo evitar <eos> Sólo espero que al final el amor no te falte, ah-ah <eos> No sabes pedir perdón, tú fuiste tan cobarde <eos> No juegues con un corazón, porque al final se parte <eos> Prefiero yo morir de amor, a que el amor me falte <eos> 
I've never given anyone a chance at my heart <eos> Momma always said it was a treasure to guard <eos> And the man whose worthy of given it to <eos> Will stick around long enough to prove it to you <eos> But now I'm the one whose losing my cool <eos> Butterflies make me feel like a fool <eos> I've always been the one in control <eos> But that boy just does something to my soul <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Around every bend and at the end he's right there waitin' for me <eos> He's chasin' me (Chasin' me) <eos> Oh, he's chasin' me (Chasin' me) <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos> He says I ain't getting away from him now <eos> I am the woman he's been dreaming about <eos> And he says, "It don't matter how long he has to wait <eos> He'll sleep outside my bedroom door in the pouring rain" <eos> And now I'm the one whose gonna give in <eos> I want his hands everywhere his eyes have been (His eyes have been) <eos> Don't think I'm trying to escape anymore <eos> 'Cause when I want I turn around to be sure <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me, (Chasin' me) <eos> Around every bend and at the end he's right there waiting for me <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Ah, he's chasin' me, (Chasin' me) <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos> He's chasin' me <eos> Oh, he's catching up <eos> It might be love (It might be love) <eos> I'll guess we'll see <eos> I'll guess we'll see <eos> Oh, he's chasin' me, yeah <eos> Yeah, he's chasin' me, chasin' me <eos> Down every road like my heart is a map he can read <eos> He's chasin' me, waiting for me <eos> And I hate to admit but I like it a little bit <eos>

I said, Shotgun! <eos> Shoot 'em 'fore they run now <eos> Do the jerk, baby <eos> Do the dirty now <eos> Hey <eos> Put on your red dress <eos> And then you go downtown now <eos> I said, Buy yourself a shotgun now <eos> We're going to break it down baby now <eos> We're going to load it up baby now <eos> Oh can you shoot 'em 'fore they run now <eos> I said, Shotgun! <eos> Shoot 'em 'fore they run now <eos> Do the jerk, baby <eos> Do the dirty now <eos> Hey <eos> Shotgun! <eos> Shoot 'em 'fore they run now <eos> Do the jerk, baby <eos> Do the dirty now <eos> Hey <eos> Put on your high heel shoes <eos> I said we're going down here listen to 'em play the blues <eos> We're gonna dig potatoes <eos> We're gonna pick tomatoes <eos> I said, Shotgun! <eos> Shoot 'em 'fore they run now <eos> Do the jerk, baby <eos> Do the dirty now <eos> Hey <eos> I said it's twine time <eos> I said it's twine time <eos> I said it's twine time <eos> Hey, look at that <eos> 
Send your dreams <eos> Where nobody hides <eos> Give your tears <eos> To the tide <eos> No time <eos> No time <eos> There's no end <eos> There is no goodbye <eos> Disappear <eos> With the night <eos> No time <eos> No time <eos> No time <eos> No time <eos> No time <eos> 
It's been awhile, since I could, hold my head high <eos> And it's been awhile, since I first saw you <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could stand on my own two feet again <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could call you <eos> But everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem <eos> The consequences that I've rendered <eos> I've stretched myself beyond my means <eos> It's been awhile, since I could say, that I wasn't addicted <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could say I love myself as well <eos> And it's been awhile, since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do <eos> And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you <eos> And everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem <eos> The consequences that I've rendered <eos> I've gone and fucked things up again <eos> Why must I feel this way? <eos> Just make this go away <eos> Just one more peaceful day <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could, look at myself straight <eos> And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry <eos> And it's been awhile, since I've seen the way the candles light your face <eos> And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste <eos> But everything I can't remember <eos> As fucked up as it all may seem to be... and I know it's me <eos> I cannot blame this on my father <eos> He did the best he could for me <eos> And it's been awhile, since I could, hold my head up high <eos> And it's been awhile, since I said I'm sorry <eos>

Victory, we fought hard and prevailed <eos> Brutally, we were fighting <eos> Stormy seas, rolling thunder, piercing hail <eos> Battlefield, lit by lightning <eos> Eagerly, we filled the waves with enemies <eos> Hungrily, ravens cawing <eos> Home shore calls, we return on bloody seas <eos> Twilight falls, darkness crawling <eos> So pour the beer for thirsty men <eos> A drink that they have earned <eos> And pour a beer for those who fell <eos> For those who did not return <eos> Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky <eos> We will drink to glory tonight <eos> Raise your horns for brave fallen friends <eos> We will meet where the beer never ends <eos> No regrets, we went out to war and strife <eos> To protect, king and country <eos> Victory, honour those who gave their life <eos> Willingly, we will not grieve <eos> So pour the beer for thirsty men <eos> A drink that they have earned <eos> And pour a beer for those who fell <eos> For those who did not return <eos> Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky <eos> We will drink to glory tonight <eos> Raise your horns for brave fallen friends <eos> We will meet where the beer never ends <eos> Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky <eos> We will drink to glory tonight <eos> Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky <eos> We will drink tonight <eos> Raise your horns, raise them up to the sky <eos> We will drink to glory tonight <eos> Raise your horns for brave fallen friends <eos> We will meet in Valhalla again <eos>

Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
One night to be confused <eos> One night to speed up truth <eos> We had a promise made <eos> Four hands and then away <eos> Both under influence <eos> We had divine sense <eos> To know what to say <eos> Mind is a razor-blade <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> One night of magic rush <eos> The start: a simple touch <eos> One night to push and scream <eos> And then relief <eos> Ten days of perfect tunes <eos> The colors red and blue <eos> We had a promise made <eos> We were in love <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> And you, you knew the hand of a devil <eos> And you, kept us awake with wolves teeth <eos> Sharing different heartbeats in one night <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Would that be good enough for me <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> 
Les matins se suivent et se ressemblent <eos> Quand l'amour fait place au quotidien <eos> On n'était pas fait pour vivre ensemble <eos> Ça n'suffit pas toujours de s'aimer bien <eos> C'est drôle, hier, on s'ennuyait <eos> Et c'est à peine si l'on trouvait <eos> Des mots pour se parler du mauvais temps <eos> Et maintenant qu'il faut partir <eos> On a cent mille choses à dire <eos> Qui tiennent trop à cœur pour si peu de temps <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos> On fait c'qu'il faut, on tient nos rôles <eos> On se regarde, on rit, on crâne un peu <eos> On a toujours oublié quelque chose <eos> C'est pas facile de se dire adieu <eos> Et l'on sait trop bien que tôt ou tard <eos> Demain peut-être ou même ce soir <eos> On va se dire que tout n'est pas perdu <eos> De ce roman inachevé, on va se faire un conte de fées <eos> Mais on a passé l'âge, on n'y croirait plus <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos> Roméo, Juliette et tous les autres <eos> Au fond de vos bouquins dormez en paix <eos> Une simple histoire comme la nôtre <eos> Est de celles qu'on écrira jamais <eos> Allons petite il faut partir <eos> Laisser ici nos souvenirs <eos> On va descendre ensemble si tu veux <eos> Et quand elle va nous voir passer <eos> La patronne du café <eos> Va encore nous dire "Salut les amoureux" <eos> On s'est aimé comme on se quitte <eos> Tout simplement sans penser à demain <eos> A demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite <eos> Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien <eos>

Leave behind the tower <eos> You know how it does us wrong <eos> I could bring you flowers <eos> Or sing you a love song <eos> Almost like I mean it <eos> When you touch me hard <eos> I forget my regret <eos> That is so inviting <eos> I could try if you would try <eos> It’s almost like we mean it <eos> Beautiful baby <eos> You say that I’m crazy <eos> And you’re not wrong <eos> But you’re here with your body <eos> Say you made me somebody <eos> How can I move on? <eos> If not with you well then with who? <eos> If this is broke then what is true? <eos> Beautiful baby <eos> You say that I’m crazy <eos> I think I’m strong <eos> Because how could you love me <eos> From so far above me <eos> I’m done holding on <eos> If not with you well then with who? <eos> If this is broke then nothing’s true <eos>

Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever <eos> It paved a wave of distance between the syntax error <eos> From Austin's yellow brick road, this is forever <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled, no sign of relief <eos> 'Cause this you know, this you know, this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Makes no difference, your alphabet is missing letters <eos> Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather <eos> A drizzle, brisk and profound <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled no sign of relief <eos> This is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Strum this broken harp <eos> We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts <eos> Yes, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Makes no!

You see that mountain over there? Yeah? <eos> Well, one of these days I'm going to climb that mountain <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Drift away like Tom Sawyer, ride a raft with old Huck Finn <eos> Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle, daze dreaming again <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Swim across the river, just to prove that I'm a man <eos> Spend the day being lazy, just being nature's friend <eos> Climb a long tall hickory. Bend it over, skinning cats <eos> Playing baseball with chert rocks, using sawmill slabs for bats <eos> Play some back-home, come-on music <eos> That comes from the heart <eos> Play something with lots of feeling <eos> Because that's where music has to start <eos> Oh, play me some mountain music <eos> Like grandma and grandpa used to play <eos> Then I'll float on down the river <eos> To a Cajun hideaway <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos> Oh play me mountain music <eos>

Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos>

Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night <eos> And wouldn't you love to love her? <eos> Takes to the sky like a bird in flight <eos> And who will be her lover? <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> She is like a cat in the dark <eos> And then she is the darkness <eos> She rules her life like a fine skylark <eos> And when the sky is starless <eos> Once in a million years a lady like her rises <eos> Oh no, Rhiannon, you cry, but she's gone <eos> Your life knows no answer, your life knows no answer <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> She rings like a bell through the night <eos> And wouldn't you love to love her? <eos> She rules her life like a bird in flight <eos> And who will be her lover? <eos> All your life you've never seen a woman <eos> Taken by the wind <eos> Would you stay if she promised you heaven? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Will you ever win? <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Rhiannon <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Taken by, taken by the sky <eos> Dreams unwind <eos> Love's a state of mind <eos> Dreams unwind <eos> Love's a state of mind <eos> 
There I was completely wasting, out of work and down <eos> All inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town <eos> Feel as though nobody cares if I live or die <eos> So I might as well begin to put some action in my life <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> So much for the golden future, I can't even start <eos> I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart <eos> You don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue <eos> If you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> You don't know what it's like <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> Breaking the law, breaking the law <eos> 
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining <eos> It's the night of our dear Savior's birth <eos> Long lay the world in sin and error pining <eos> 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth <eos> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <eos> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn <eos> Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices! <eos> O night divine, O night when Christ was born <eos> O night divine, O night divine! <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> 
What if I were smiling? <eos> And falling into your arms? <eos> Would you see then? <eos> What I can see now? <eos> Tell me about the old days <eos> Us against December skies <eos> I've spent my happiest days here <eos> Carry me forever in your heart <eos> Now I'm standing here alone <eos> In the street where we once met <eos> I am sadder than I've ever been <eos> But still glad you're doing well <eos> And I hope even when I'm gone <eos> Your smile will never lеave your face <eos> And I am sadder than I'vе ever been <eos> But still glad you're doing well <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut your name into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut our names into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> And so I smiled at you <eos> If I never shed a tear for you <eos> Cause alone from the heart <eos> You can touch the sky <eos> Don't think of me too often <eos> I don't want you to get sad <eos> I think I'll miss you forever <eos> Like the sun the stars in the morning skies <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut your name into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> Words like stones <eos> Thrown into my face <eos> Cut our names into me <eos> And throw me off a bridge <eos> What if I were smiling? <eos> And falling into your arms? <eos> Would you see then? <eos> What I can see now? <eos> So, this was us my dear <eos> Us against December skies <eos> I've spent my happiest days here <eos> Carry us forever in your heart <eos> 
I keep losing track of time <eos> My sense of self where I belong <eos> I keep falling deeper into the hole <eos> Disconnected, all alone <eos> Through it all, we love, we fall <eos> We hope, we fear, we fight, we crawl <eos> Against it all, willful and strong <eos> Until the waves take us, take us home <eos> My mind is racing, lost train of thought <eos> Eyes unfocused, tired of this world <eos> These walls will collapse, wash out to the sea <eos> And I'll float along, let the stream carry me <eos> Through it all, we love, we fall <eos> We hope, we fear, we fight, we crawl <eos> Against it all, willful and strong <eos> Until the waves take us, take us home <eos> Through it all, we love, we fall <eos> We hope, we fear, we fight, we crawl <eos> 
In a world that can be so insane <eos> I don't think it's very strange <eos> For me to be in love with you <eos> I wanna know more than your brain <eos> Into my life you were injected <eos> Not something that I expected <eos> Now I smile from your affection <eos> We have made a soul connection <eos> Just for whom does your bell toll <eos> Don't be cold, show me your soul <eos> Sentimental gentlemen <eos> Are not afraid to show you when <eos> I am you, you're my best friend <eos> Show me your soul <eos> In a world that can be so insane <eos> I don't think it's very strange <eos> For me to be in love with you <eos> I wanna know more than your brain <eos> Yes, I find you so appealing <eos> When you show me how you're feeling <eos> You, my friend, need not be kneeling <eos> Open up and start revealing <eos> Trust in me my heart is sole <eos> I need to see, show me your soul <eos> Sentimental gentlemen <eos> Are not afraid to show you when <eos> I am you, you're my best friend <eos> Show me your soul <eos> In a world that can be so insane <eos> I don't think it's very strange <eos> For me to be in love with you <eos> I wanna know more than your brain <eos> Don't expect too much from me <eos> Perfection is no test for me <eos> Because the best I'll ever be <eos> Is just like you, a human being <eos> You won't offend, I need to know <eos> Please, my friend, show me your soul <eos> Sentimental gentlemen <eos> Are not afraid to show you when <eos> I am you, you're my best friend <eos> Show me your soul <eos>

Juntos, la inmensidad <eos> Un mundo, nuestra casa chica, el tiempo no importa porque <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos para inventar <eos> A no aburrirnos <eos> Desafiar las horas de un futuro incierto <eos> Que solo nos sirve <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Coro: <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Nos juramos juntos que aunque la vida pase <eos> Los rios corran y los pajaros emigren <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Basta que te mire <eos> Basta que te roce <eos> Bastan nuestros cuerpos humedos y tibios <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos la eternidad <eos> Dos soledades <eos> Un iman perfecto <eos> Casi el egoismo <eos> Solo para amarnos <eos> Para amarnos mas... <eos> Coro... <eos> 
Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree; <eos> And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud <eos> I can' t understand <eos> I get misty, just holding your hand <eos> Walk my way <eos> And a thousand violins begin to play <eos> Or it might be the sound of your hello <eos> That music I hear <eos> I get misty, the moment you're near <eos> You can say that you're leading me on <eos> But it's just what I want you to do <eos> Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost <eos> That's why I'm following you <eos> On my own <eos> Would I wander through this wonderland alone <eos> Never knowing my right foot from my left <eos> My hat from my glove <eos> I'm too misty, and too much in love <eos> I'm just too misty <eos> And too much <eos> In love..... <eos> 
Deutsch <eos> TEXT: Ernst Anschütz, 1824 <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> Du grünst nicht nur <eos> Zur Sommerzeit <eos> Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit <eos> Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Dein Kleid will mich <eos> Was lehren: <eos> Die Hoffnung und Beständigkeit <eos> Gibt Trost und Kraft <eos> Zu jeder Zeit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Das soll dein Kleid <eos> Mich lehren <eos> English <eos> Literal English translation <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> You're green not only <eos> In the summertime <eos> No, also in winter when it snows <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> How often has not at Christmastime <eos> A tree like you given me such joy! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> Your dress wants to <eos> Teach me something: <eos> Your hope and durability <eos> Provide comfort and strength <eos> At any time <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> That's what your dress should <eos> Teach me <eos> 
There's nothing weirder than to wake up with my enemy <eos> Despite I know that I was wrong <eos> I take the thought and push it away <eos> I don't believe that the fact I never learn <eos> I never change, won't have a downside for me <eos> I'm immortal, I'll be ok <eos> But what comes up must come down, that's what they say, what they say <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I'm hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> I can't help it, I'm such a slave <eos> There is something in my veins I can't contain <eos> When will I learn to behave? <eos> So just fuck it, let's play the game <eos> Let's enjoy the ride, we all die all the same <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I'm hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> There's always hope in a brand new day <eos> When we dream then the reality seem far away <eos> When morning comes same old thing because <eos> Life's a party and I’m hopelessly addicted to the rush <eos> 
All this talk of getting old <eos> It's getting me down, my love <eos> Like a cat in a bag <eos> Waiting to drown <eos> This time I'm coming down <eos> And I hope you're thinking of me <eos> As you lay down on your side <eos> Now the drugs don't work <eos> They just make you worse <eos> But I know I'll see your face again <eos> Now the drugs don't work <eos> They just make you worse <eos> But I know I'll see your face again <eos> But I know I'm on a losing streak <eos> Cause I passed down my old street <eos> And if you want a show <eos> Then just let me know <eos> And I'll sing in your ear again <eos> Now the drugs don't work <eos> They just make you worse <eos> But I know I'll see your face again <eos> 'Cause, Baby, ooh, if heaven calls <eos> I'm coming too <eos> Just like you said <eos> You leave my life <eos> I'm better off dead <eos> All this talk of getting old <eos> It's getting me down my love <eos> Like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown <eos> This time I'm coming down <eos> Now the drugs don't work <eos> They just make you worse <eos> But I know I'll see your face again <eos> 'Cause baby, ooh, if heaven calls <eos> I'm coming too <eos> Just like you said <eos> You leave my life <eos> I'm better off dead <eos> But if you want a show <eos> Then just let me know <eos> And I'll sing in your ear again <eos> Now the drugs don't work <eos> They just make you worse <eos> But I know I'll see your face again <eos> Yeah, I know I'll see your face again <eos> Yeah, I know I'll see your face again <eos> Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord <eos> Yeah, I know I'll see your face again, oh Lord <eos> I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down <eos> No more, no more, no more, no more, no more <eos> I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down <eos> No more, no more, no more, no more, no more <eos> I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down <eos> No more, no more, no more, no more, no more <eos> I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down <eos> No more, no more, no more, no more, no more <eos> I'm never coming down, I'm never coming down <eos> No more, no more, no more, no more, no more <eos> 
A million miles away <eos> Your signal in the distance <eos> To whom it may concern <eos> I think I lost my way <eos> Gettin' good at startin' over <eos> Every time that I return <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> Do you remember the days <eos> We built these paper mountains <eos> Then sat and watched them burn? <eos> I think I found my place <eos> Can't you feel it growin' stronger? <eos> Little conquerors <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> Now <eos> For the very first time <eos> Don't you pay no mind <eos> Set me free again <eos> To keep alive a moment at a time <eos> But still inside a whisper to a riot <eos> To sacrifice but knowin' to survive <eos> The first to climb another state of mind <eos> I'm on my knees, I'm prayin' for a sign <eos> Forever, whenever, I never want to die <eos> I never want to die, I never want to die <eos> I'm on my knees, I never want to die <eos> I'm dancin' on my grave, I'm runnin' through the fire <eos> Forever, whenever, I never want to die <eos> I never want to leave, I never say goodbye <eos> Forever, whenever, forever, whenever <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos> Where do I begin? <eos> I'm learnin' to walk again <eos> I believe I've waited long enough <eos> I'm learnin' to talk again <eos> Can't you see I've waited long enough? <eos>

Yo aquí llorandote un río <eos> Mandándome al olvido <eos> Que cosa mas injusta amor <eos> Fuiste matando mis pasiones <eos> Tachando mis canciones <eos> Me tenías pisoteado <eos> Estaba desahuseado <eos> No es justo no bebé <eos> Oh oh veo <eos> Pero este mundo ya giró <eos> Y ahora te tocó perder <eos> Oh oh veo <eos> Bebé te lloré todo un río (bebé, bebé) <eos> Bebé, te lloré a reventar (bebé, bebé) <eos> Oh no no no, no tienes corazón, oh oh <eos> No te vuelvo a amar <eos> Te lloré todo un río <eos> Ahora llorame un mar <eos> Ya no me busques ya es muy tarde <eos> Ya tengo otro amor <eos> Una chula sirena <eos> Que nada en mi piel <eos> Que te perdono, no hay rencores <eos> Solo los dolores <eos> Mi alma esta arañada <eos> Lloré el suelo mojado <eos> No es justo no bebé <eos> Oh oh veo <eos> Verdad que un río te lloré <eos> Verdad que no te vuelvo a amar <eos> Oh no no no, no te vuelvo a amar <eos> Verdad que un río te lloré <eos> Verdad que no te vuelvo a amar <eos> Oh no no no, pierde tiempo amar <eos> Verdad que un río te lloré <eos> Verdad que no te vuelvo a amar <eos> Llorame, llorame, llorame <eos>

I walk the streets of Japan 'til I get lost <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> With a graveyard tan carrying a cross <eos> Yeah, it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like studying faces in parking lot <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like drivin' backwards in the fog <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> The things that I've loved, things that I've lost <eos> Things I've held sacred that I've dropped <eos> I won't lie no more you can bet <eos> I don't wanna learn what I'll need to forget <eos> I like gypsy moths and radio talk <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like gospel music and canned applause <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like colorful clothing in the sun <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like hammering nails and speaking in tongues <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> The things that I've loved, things that I've lost <eos> Things I've held sacred that I've dropped <eos> I won't lie no more you can bet <eos> Don't wanna learn what I'll need... <eos> Bend and shape me, I love the way you are <eos> Slow and sweetly like never before <eos> Calm and sleeping, we won't stir up the past <eos> So discreetly we won't look back <eos> The things that I've loved, things that I've lost <eos> Things I've held sacred that I've dropped <eos> I won't lie no more you can bet <eos> I don't wanna learn what I'll need <eos> I like throwing my voice and breaking guitars <eos> 'Cause it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> I like playin' in the sand, what's mine is ours <eos> If it doesn't remind me of anything <eos> 
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the ones I used to know <eos> Where the treetops glisten and children listen <eos> To hear sleigh bells in the snow <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> With every Christmas card I write <eos> "May your days be merry and bright <eos> Blanca Navidad" <eos> Ah, blanca Navidad <eos> Sueño que cae nieve al rededor <eos> Y la noche buena es mensajera <eos> De paz, de magia y de amor <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Just like the onеs I used to know <eos> Where thе treetops glisten and children listen <eos> Blanca Navidad <eos> "May your days be merry and bright <eos> And may all your Christmases be white" <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> 
Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
Si me dieran a elegir una vez más <eos> Te eligiría sin pensarlo <eos> Es que no hay nada que pensar <eos> Que no existe ni motivo, ni razón <eos> Para dudarlo ni un segundo <eos> Porque tú has sido lo mejor <eos> Que tocó este corazón <eos> Y que entre el cielo y tú <eos> Yo me quedo contigo <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> Si esto no es querer entonces dime tú lo que será <eos> Si necesito de tus besos pa' que pueda respirar <eos> Y de tus ojos que van regalando vida <eos> Y que me dejan sin salida <eos> ¿Y para qué quiero salir? <eos> Si nunca he sido tan feliz <eos> Que te prefiero más que nada en este mundo <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> (Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo) <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¡Oh! ¿Y es que no ves <eos> Que toda mi vida tan sólo depende de ti? <eos> Yeh-he <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> (Si te he dado todo lo que tengo) <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> (Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo) <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos>

I can't remember <eos> The last time you smiled <eos> We haven't made love <eos> In such a long, long while <eos> If it's over <eos> We'd better move on <eos> But when you leave me <eos> Leave me alone <eos> So many nights <eos> I spent by your side <eos> So many more <eos> Without you I cried <eos> And it ain't right <eos> You're doing me wrong <eos> So when you leave me <eos> Leave me alone <eos> When you leave me <eos> Leave me alone <eos> Don't write me letters <eos> Don't call me on the phone <eos> I'll be just fine <eos> When I'm finally on my own <eos> So when you leave me <eos> Leave me alone <eos>

Mercy like a gun when you’ve come undone <eos> I’ve awoken in the hour that receives no one <eos> The sound of a tribe will shake me out until sunrise <eos> The heat of tomorrow released as the wind blows <eos> A beating stare from all the tribe <eos> No sleep tonight <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Stripped of all the air in my lungs now <eos> Flee from the walls <eos> So alone <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Raise me up in my throes <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Upon the burial lie thieves of their past <eos> Firewater <eos> Tenacious <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Between the living and the dead we move <eos> Between the living and the dead we all move <eos> Shift all placement, but they’re sifting you <eos> Between the living and the dead we all move <eos> The claim we stake <eos> A land within our wake <eos> A garden in the bones <eos> A headdress down in the soil we own <eos> We build it on the bullshit or build it upon the burial <eos> A garden in the bones <eos> A headdress down in the soil we own, yeah <eos> Stripped of all the air in my lungs now <eos> Feeling so alone <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Feeling so low <eos> Pull out all the ground from below <eos> You’ve given quite a show <eos> Stampede in the room like a buffalo <eos> Raise me up in my throes <eos> The howl from below <eos> The wolf and the soaring crow <eos> Am I losing control? <eos> Am I losing all of control? <eos> All spirits entrance <eos> I toss and turn in no romance <eos> From six under the grass the prison breaks like glass <eos> Upon the burial lie thieves of their past <eos> Firewater <eos> Tenacious <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Upon the burial ground <eos> Between the living and the dead we move (We move) <eos> Mercy like a gun <eos>

We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> The music played <eos> While our bodies <eos> Displayed through the dance <eos> Then love picked us out for romance <eos> I thought it was clear <eos> The plan was we would share <eos> This feeling just between ourselves <eos> But when the music changed <eos> The plan was rearranged <eos> He went to dance with someone else <eos> We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> But now he's with somebody new <eos> What does love want me to do? <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Guess he's discovered <eos> We are truly lovers <eos> Magic from the very start <eos> 'Cause love just kept me groovin' <eos> And he felt me movin' <eos> Even though we danced apart <eos> So we started dancing <eos> And love put us into the groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Love said <eos> (Let the music play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> (He won't get away) <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away... <eos>

Yo te di todo mi amor y más <eos> Y tu no reconoces ni lo que es amar <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Yo se que un día tu volverás <eos> Y tu de todo te arrepentirás <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> Take a look at the five and ten <eos> It's glistening once again <eos> With candy canes and silver lanes aglow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots <eos> Is the wish of Barney and Ben; <eos> Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk <eos> Is the hope of Janice and Jen; <eos> And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well <eos> It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; <eos> Soon the bells will start <eos> And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing <eos> Right within your heart <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> Sure it's Christmas once more <eos> 
There it stands in the corner with the barrel so straight <eos> I looked out the winder and over the gate <eos> The big fat rabbits are jumpin' in the grass <eos> Wait 'till they hear my old shotgun blast <eos> Shotgun boogie, I done saw your track <eos> Look out Mr. Rabbit when I cock my hammer back <eos> Well, over on the ridge is a scaly bark <eos> Hickory nuts so big you can see'em in the dark <eos> The big fat squirrels, they scratch and they fight <eos> I'll be on that ridge before daylight <eos> With a shotgun boogie, all I need is one shot <eos> Look out bushy-tails, tonight you'll be in the pot <eos> Well, I met a pretty gal, she was tall and thin <eos> I asked her what she had, she said a Fox four-ten <eos> I looked her up and down, said boy this is love <eos> So we headed for the brush to shoot a big fat dove <eos> Shotgun boogie, boy the feathers flew <eos> Look out Mr. Dove when she draws a bead on you <eos> I sat down on a log, took her on my lap <eos> She said wait a minute bud, you got to see my pap <eos> He's gotta sixteen gauge choked down like a rifle <eos> He don't like a man that's gonna trifle <eos> Shotgun boogie, draws a bead so fine <eos> Look out big boy, he's loaded all the time <eos> Well, I called on her pap like a gentleman oughter <eos> He said no brush hunter's gonna get my daughter <eos> He cocked back the hammer right on the spot <eos> When the gun went off I outrun the shot <eos> Shotgun boogie, I wanted weddin' bells <eos> I'll be back little gal, when your pappy runs out of shells <eos> 
When it's not always raining, there'll be days like this <eos> When there's no one complaining, there'll be days like this <eos> When everything falls into place like the flick of a switch <eos> Well my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't need to worry, there'll be days like this <eos> When no one's in a hurry, there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't get betrayed by that old Judas kiss <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't need an answer, there'll be days like this <eos> When you don't meet a chancer, there'll be days like this <eos> When all the parts of the puzzle start to look like they fit, yeah <eos> Then I must remember there'll be days like this <eos> When everyone is up front and they're not playing tricks, yeah <eos> When you don't have no freeloaders out to get their kicks, yeah <eos> When it's nobody's business the way that you want to live <eos> I just have to remember there'll be days like this <eos> When no one steps on my dream, there'll be days like this <eos> When people understand what I mean, there'll be days like this <eos> When you ring out the changes of how everything is <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> Oh my mama told me there'll be days like this <eos> 
Bobby's got a duster '79 <eos> Bottle of Jack and a 45 <eos> Points it at his head <eos> And he starts to cry <eos> Too proud to ask me <eos> To save his life <eos> Billy's in a limo <eos> On the upper east side <eos> Playing Russian Roulette <eos> With the long white line <eos> His wife gets a call at 3 a.m <eos> Saying "Billy ain't never coming home again" <eos> She asks me why? <eos> And I said <eos> I sure wish you'd believe <eos> That everybody's free <eos> And I'll help you if you ask me to <eos> I gave every star a name <eos> The sunshine and the rain <eos> But I can't decide the road you choose <eos> That's up to you <eos> I'm only Jesus <eos> Johnny had a good job <eos> Rakin' it in <eos> Caviar parties <eos> With his well to do friends <eos> Something was missing <eos> From his perfect little life <eos> He threw in the towel <eos> And he called me one night <eos> Betty was an orphan <eos> Like so many kids <eos> They taught her in school <eos> That I didn't exist <eos> She had every reason not to talk to me <eos> But every night before bed <eos> She got down on her knees <eos> Just to tell me hi <eos> And I said <eos> I sure wish you'd believe <eos> That everybody's free <eos> And I'll help you if you ask me to <eos> I gave every star a name <eos> The sunshine and the rain <eos> But I can't decide the road you choose <eos> That's up to you <eos> I'm only Jesus <eos> Hey you're all the same to me <eos> Everybody's free <eos> And I'll help you if you ask me to <eos> I gave every star a name <eos> The sunshine and the rain <eos> But I can't decide the road you choose <eos> That's up to you <eos> I'm only Jesus <eos> I'm only Jesus <eos> I'm only Jesus <eos> Gotta have Jesus to see the light <eos> Gotta have Jesus to hold you tight <eos> Gotta have Jesus to talk to me <eos> I gotta have Jesus to set me free <eos>

El camino que lleva a Belén <eos> Baja hasta el valle que la nieve cubrió <eos> Los pastorcillos quieren ver a su Rey <eos> Le traen regalos en su humilde zurrón <eos> Al Redentor, al Redentor <eos> Yo quisiera poner a tu pies <eos> Algún presente que te agrade Señor <eos> Mas Tú ya sabes que soy pobre también <eos> Y no poseo más que un viejo tambor <eos> (rom pom pom pom, rom pom pom pom) <eos> ¡En tu honor frente al portal tocaré <eos> Con mi tambor ! <eos> El camino que lleva a Belén <eos> Voy marcando con mi viejo tambor <eos> Nada hay mejor que yo pueda ofrecer <eos> Su ronco acento es un canto de amor <eos> Al Redentor, al Redentor <eos> Cuando Dios me vió tocando ante El me sonrió <eos>

A-hey, do it now, huh <eos> Yeah, hey <eos> Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer <eos> Playing in a rock and roll band <eos> I never had no problems, yeah <eos> Burning down the one-night stands <eos> Then everything around me, yeah <eos> It got to start to feeling so low <eos> And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh <eos> To disco down and check out the show <eos> Yeah, they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh <eos> 'Til you die, yeah (What?) <eos> Hear, hear, heh <eos> A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah) <eos> Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds <eos> Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I <eos> To not see I was the one behind? <eos> So still I kept on fighting <eos> Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?) <eos> I said, "I must go back there", I got to go back <eos> And check to see if things still the same <eos> Yeah, they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy (Yeah) <eos> Play that funky music right, oh <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh <eos> 'Til you die (Yeah) <eos> Whoa, 'til you die <eos> Gonna play some electrified funky music, yow! <eos> Ah ha ha <eos> Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy <eos> Changing rock and roll and minds <eos> Yeah, things were getting shaky <eos> (Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh <eos> Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better <eos> I'm funking out in every way <eos> But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't <eos> Of how I learned my lesson that day <eos> When they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh <eos> 'Til you die (Yeah) <eos> Oh, 'til you die, yeah <eos> Come on, let's go! <eos> (They shouted, play that funky music) Play that funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) You gotta keep on playing funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) Play that funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) Come on and take you higher <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, honky <eos> Play that funky music right <eos>

I promise that I won't fall down <eos> I promise that I won't skin my knee <eos> Like you promised you'd always be around to take good care of me <eos> And I remember you standing behind that white picket fence with a white peaked face <eos> Trying hard to embrace my youth <eos> Before it escapes, before its too late <eos> And clutching the fence she said <eos> 'How have I hurt you, What have I done?' <eos> 'Did I desert you, or spite with my tongue?' <eos> 'Was I too eager, or loved you too much?' <eos> I love you too much <eos> Now that I'm all grown. I'm feeling so alone <eos> Why have you brought me here? <eos> Now that I'm all grown. I'm feeling so alone <eos> Why have you brought me here? <eos> You say all these things I say but It's not the same <eos> I'm feeling so alone today but all I know <eos> I'll ice my thoughts I'll ice my mind for now <eos> It's not your fault, You did what you could do <eos> For this I will love you, for always <eos> You hold my heart and my tiny hand <eos> Thank you for all these things <eos> 
Heyr, himna smiður <eos> Hvers skáldið biður <eos> Komi mjúk til mín <eos> Miskunnin þín <eos> Því heit eg á þig <eos> Þú hefur skaptan mig <eos> Eg er þrællinn þinn <eos> Þú ert drottinn minn <eos> Guð, heit eg á þig <eos> Að þú græðir mig <eos> Minnst þú, mildingur, mín <eos> Mest þurfum þín <eos> Ryð þú, röðla gramur <eos> Ríklyndur og framur <eos> Hölds hverri sorg <eos> Úr hjartaborg <eos> Gæt þú, mildingur, mín <eos> Mest þurfum þín <eos> Helzt hverja stund <eos> Á hölda grund <eos> Send þú, meyjar mögur <eos> Málsefnin fögur <eos> Öll er hjálp af þér <eos> Í hjarta mér <eos> 
Now there's a backseat lover that's always undercover <eos> And I talk 'til my daddy say <eos> Said, "You ain't seen nothing 'til you're down on a muffin" <eos> "And there's sure to be a change in ways" <eos> Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder <eos> As far as I can reminisce <eos> But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin <eos> And it started with a little kiss, like this <eos> See-saw swinging with the boys in school <eos> And her feet was flying up in the air <eos> Singing, "Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle" <eos> And they swinging like it just don't care <eos> So I took a big chance at the high school dance <eos> With a lady who was ready to play <eos> It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin' <eos> When she told me how to walk this way <eos> She told me to <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to) <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Well, just gimme a kiss <eos> Ooh, like this <eos> School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy <eos> Little skirt hanging way up her knee <eos> It was three young ladies in the school gym locker <eos> And they found they were looking at D <eos> I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady <eos> 'Til the boys told me something I missed <eos> That my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor <eos> And I gave the girl a little kiss, like this <eos> See-saw swinging with the boys in the school <eos> With your feet flying up in the air <eos> Singing, "Hey diddle diddle, with your kitty in the middle" <eos> I was swinging like I didn't care <eos> So I took a big chance at the high school dance <eos> With a missy who was ready to play <eos> Wasn't me she was foolin' when she knew what she was doin' <eos> When she told me how to walk this way <eos> She told me to <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Walk this way, talk this way (She told me to) <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Walk this way, talk this way <eos> Well, just gimme some head <eos> Like this <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos> 
I hear the drums echoing tonight <eos> But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation <eos> She's coming in, 12:30 flight <eos> Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation <eos> I stopped an old man along the way <eos> Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies <eos> He turned to me as if to say <eos> "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> The wild dogs cry out in the night <eos> As they grow restless longing for some solitary company <eos> I know that I must do what's right <eos> As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti <eos> I seek to cure what's deep inside <eos> Frightened of this thing that I've become <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> 
As long as time keeps ticking, long as people have to cry <eos> When I see loved ones leaving, saying last goodbyes <eos> I believe these blues are never gonna die <eos> When I see bad things happen to good folks everyday <eos> Children going hungry with nothin’ on their plates <eos> I believe these blues won’t ever go away <eos> People try to end their troubles by drinking whiskey down <eos> But I believe these blues will always be around <eos> I can’t tell the future but I can play my song <eos> I can’t tell the future but I sho' 'nuf can play my song <eos> And I believe these blues will go on and on and on <eos>

In your life you seem to have it all <eos> You seem to have control <eos> But deep within your soul <eos> You're losing it <eos> You never took the time <eos> Assume that you're to blame <eos> You think that you're insane <eos> Won't you spare me <eos> I know the breakdown <eos> Everything is gonna shake now someday <eos> I know the breakdown <eos> Tell me again am I awake now maybe <eos> You can find the reason that no one else is living this way <eos> Yeah your lies <eos> Your world is built around <eos> Two faces of a clown <eos> The voices in your head <eos> Think there's four pawns down <eos> Well in this unity <eos> Fate has found the need <eos> So you better check yourself <eos> Before you check out <eos> If you find yourself <eos> Then you might believe <eos> Then within yourself <eos> You just might conceive <eos> You can find the reason that (you can find the reason that) <eos> No one else is living this way (you can find the reason that way) <eos> 
Just a song we shared, I'll hear <eos> Brings memories back when you were here <eos> Of your smile, your easy laughter <eos> Of your kiss, those moments after <eos> I think of you <eos> And think of you <eos> And think of you <eos> Of the dreams we dreamt together <eos> Of the love we vowed would never <eos> Melt like snowflakes in the sun <eos> My days now end as they begun <eos> With thoughts of you <eos> And I think of you <eos> And think of you <eos> Down the streets I walked with you <eos> Seeing others doing things we do <eos> Now these thoughts are haunting me <eos> Of how complete I used to be <eos> And in these times that we're apart <eos> I'll hear this song that breaks my heart <eos> And think of you <eos> And I think of you <eos> And think of you <eos> And think of you <eos> And I do <eos> 
Ooh, ooh, ah <eos> Oh woah <eos> Hmm, hmm <eos> Tell me how <eos> Are we supposed to still be talkin' every day <eos> When everything between us just completely changed? <eos> Oh, why? <eos> And tell me how <eos> Am I supposed to go ahead and just erase <eos> Every feeling, every memory we share? <eos> Oh, why? <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> So tell me how <eos> How could you tell me that you love me by mistake? <eos> Intoxicated, via texts, ain't you ashamed? <eos> That's so wild <eos> So how can I <eos> Believe or trust in anything that you say <eos> When you so easily regret it next day? <eos> See, that ain't right <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love (This love, this love) <eos> Yeah, I was dying for your love, your love <eos> So tell me, baby, do you want me like I want you? <eos> Even if you do, you wouldn't say, I know you <eos> Some nights I even think about if I should call you <eos> 'Cause I thought you were the one <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Ooh woah, ooh woah <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Ooh woah, ooh woah <eos> I know nobody's perfect <eos> And we are the way we are <eos> But you know I don't deserve this <eos> And I've waited way too long <eos> 'Cause I was dying for this love, this love <eos> Yeah I've been dying for your love, your love <eos> 
I don't know why I can't quite <eos> Get you out my sight <eos> You're always just behind <eos> You're stored across my mind <eos> Keep crawling back to where we last <eos> Left our love on hold <eos> I'm always out for more <eos> So what you waiting for? <eos> Wait, before you burn me to the ground <eos> Please stay till the beat of our heart runs out <eos> I don't wanna let go, let go <eos> 'Cause I've been tryna hold on for so long <eos> I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover" <eos> Save me, save me <eos> From every single heartache, heartache <eos> I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover" <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover" <eos> One by one and two by twice <eos> I've watched all my loves <eos> Move on to something more <eos> Open out the door <eos> Caught in-between every passing hour <eos> Oh, please stay until the taste of your love turns sour <eos> I don't wanna let go, let go <eos> 'Cause I've been tryna hold on for so long <eos> I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover" <eos> Save me, save me <eos> From every single heartache, heartache <eos> I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lover" <eos> So let me know, did we ever mean anything at all? <eos> So let me know, did we ever mean anything at all? <eos> I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "didn't hurt me" <eos> Ooh, I feel like I'm lost without a trace <eos> Take my heart and run away <eos> She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover" <eos> I've been looking for a lasting lover <eos> Oh, I've been looking for a lasting lover <eos> 
Mirandote a los ojos juraria <eos> Que tienes algo nuevo que contarme <eos> Empieza ya mujer no tengas miedo <eos> Quizá para mañana sea tarde <eos> Quizá para mañana sea tarde <eos> Y como es él <eos> En que lugar se enamoró de ti <eos> De donde es A qué dedica el tiempo libre <eos> Preguntale <eos> Por que ha robado un trozo de mi vida <eos> Es un ladrón Que me ha robado todo <eos> Arréglate mujer que se hace tarde <eos> Y llévate el paraguas por si llueve <eos> El estará esperando para amarte <eos> Y yo estaré celoso de perderte <eos> Y abrígate te sienta bien ese vestido gris <eos> Sonríete que no sospeche que has llorado <eos> Y dejame que vaya preparando tu equipaje <eos> Discúlpame Si te hago otra pregunta <eos> 
Sun in my eyes, navy blue skies <eos> You are the reason I can survive <eos> We'll turn off the phones to just be alone <eos> We'll draw the curtains and never leave home <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> "What's easy is right," my mother's advice <eos> You are the reason I never think twice <eos> Wherever we go, what glitters is gold <eos> You'll be my best friend until we grow old <eos> I had a nightmare (Oh) <eos> But now that I'm not scared <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh) <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos> This is how you fall in love <eos> Let go and I'll hold you up <eos> So pull me tight and close your eyes <eos> Oh, my love, side to side <eos>

Storming through the party like my name was El Niño <eos> When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino <eos> As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name <eos> Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came <eos> I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school <eos> Never going, never showing up when we had to <eos> Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave <eos> I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall <eos> But what would you expect with a conscience so small? <eos> Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised <eos> Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised <eos> 'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and <eos> Cutting people down is just a minor offense then <eos> It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn <eos> I'm sick of being told to wait my turn <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Don't count on me to let you know when <eos> Don't count on me, I'll do it again <eos> Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing <eos> Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening <eos> Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat <eos> Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing <eos> You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin <eos> But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing <eos> 'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook <eos> You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book <eos> I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion <eos> The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Casualty of society <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Victim of your conformity and back down <eos>

(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah) <eos> I was listenin' to the ocean <eos> I saw a face in the sand <eos> But when I picked it up <eos> Then it vanished away from my hands (Dah) <eos> I had a dream I was seven <eos> Climbin' my way in a tree <eos> I saw a piece of heaven <eos> Waitin' in patience for me (Dah) <eos> And I was runnin' far away <eos> Would I run off the world someday? <eos> Nobody knows, nobody knows <eos> And I was dancing in the rain <eos> I felt alive and I can't complain <eos> But no, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I can't take it anymore <eos> I was painting a picture <eos> The picture was a painting of you <eos> And for a moment I thought you were here <eos> But then again, it wasn't true (Dah) <eos> And all this time I have been lyin' <eos> Oh, lyin' in secret to myself <eos> I've been putting sorrow on the farthest place on my shelf <eos> La-di-da <eos> And I was runnin' far away <eos> Would I run off the world someday? <eos> Nobody knows, nobody knows <eos> And I was dancing in the rain <eos> I felt alive and I can't complain <eos> But no, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I got no other place to go <eos> No, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I got no other place to go <eos> No, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I can't take it anymore <eos> But I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall <eos> And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall <eos> And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall <eos> And I kept runnin' for a soft place to fall <eos> And I was runnin' far away <eos> Would I run off the world someday? <eos> But no, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I got no other place to go <eos> No, take me home <eos> Take me home where I belong <eos> I got no other place to go <eos> No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no <eos> No, take me home, home where I belong, oh, oh, oh <eos> No, take me home, home where I belong, no, no <eos> No, take me home, home where I belong <eos> I can't take it anymore <eos>

Vida que ha venido pa' llenarme de color el alma <eos> Hoy navego en tus lunares y en tus labios carmesí <eos> Como se cuece el calor de tu piel, en mi piel <eos> Se vuelve el cuento fantasía, amada mía, oh <eos> Que dibuja mi sol <eos> Como vino tu voz, y me dijo que el amor eres tú <eos> Cigüita alzando vuelo <eos> Como vino tu olor, a llenarme de inmensa gratitud <eos> Me llevas a tu nido de amor <eos> Como vino tu piel, para dibujar cariño y querer <eos> Llegaste justo a tiempo <eos> Como vino tu olor, y me dijo que el amor eres tú <eos> Lluvia que ha bajado desde la montaña <eos> Mis caricias, tus caricias, que se tejen entre sí <eos> Como contrasta el color, de tu piel con mi piel <eos> Se vuelve el cuento fantasía, amada mía, oh <eos> Que dibuja mi sol <eos> Como vino tu voz, y me dijo que el amor eres tú <eos> Cigüita alzando vuelo <eos> Como vino tu olor, a llenarme de inmensa gratitud <eos> Me llevas a tu nido de amor <eos> Como vino tu piel, para dibujar cariño y querer <eos> Llegaste justo a tiempo <eos> Como vino tu olor, y me dijo que el amor eres tú <eos> Vida que ha venido pa' llenarme de color el alma <eos> Hoy navego en tus lunares y en tus labios carmesí <eos>

Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos>

Do you remember happy together? <eos> I do, don't you? <eos> Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach <eos> Is that still true? <eos> You said, "forever," in the end I fought it <eos> Please be honest, are we better for it? <eos> Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called <eos> And said, "I miss you" <eos> I caught it <eos> Good to each other, give it the summer <eos> I knew, you too <eos> But I only saw you once in December <eos> I'm still confused <eos> You said, "forever," and I almost bought it <eos> I miss fighting in your old apartment <eos> Breaking dishes when you're disappointed <eos> I still love you, I promise <eos> Nothing happened in the way I wanted <eos> Every corner of this house is haunted <eos> And I know you said that we're not talking <eos> But I miss you, I'm sorry <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos> 
Driving down a goodbye road <eos> Scanning through the radio <eos> Cause misery loves company <eos> And here I am alone <eos> Dying for some steel guitar <eos> And to hear somebody falling apart <eos> To share my pain but it sounds the same <eos> On every station in this car <eos> Nobody’s singing ‘bout love gone wrong <eos> Or being as lonely as the night is long <eos> I like a party in a truck <eos> Every bit as much as the next guy <eos> But come on she’s gone <eos> And sometimes you need a heartbreak song <eos> Some words to make me fight back tears <eos> Would sure be music to my ears <eos> All this dancing around with the tailgate down <eos> Ain’t what I need to hear <eos> But nobody’s singing ‘bout lovе gone wrong <eos> Or being as lonely as thе night is long <eos> I like a party in a truck <eos> Every bid as much as the next guy <eos> But come on she’s gone <eos> And sometimes you need a heartbreak song <eos> Yeah she looks so good in the bonfire light <eos> Ball cap and blue jeans on hot summer nights <eos> These feel good songs just don’t feel right <eos> Now she’s gone <eos> But nobody’s singing ‘bout love gone wrong <eos> Or being as lonely as the night is long <eos> I like a party in a truck <eos> Every bid as much as the next guy <eos> But come on man she’s gone <eos> And sometimes you need a heartbreak song <eos> Yeah sometimes you need a heartbreak song <eos> 
Maybe in ten years <eos> You'll call me on your telephone <eos> Wondering if I'm all alone <eos> Remember how we knew each other? <eos> In ten years, everyone's been down the line <eos> And we've all ended up fine <eos> I no longer know your number <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> We used to talk real slow <eos> About the things that no one knows <eos> I hate when people bring flowers <eos> Trapped in glass their final hour <eos> And life rolls, it's all so fast until it slows <eos> We cried that night in Carrboro <eos> Realized we were letting go <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> Used to love you like the world would end <eos> Used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> 
Cupid, draw back your bow <eos> And let your arrow flow <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> Nobody but me <eos> Cupid, please hear my cry <eos> And let your arrow fly <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> I don't want to bother you <eos> But I'm in distress <eos> There's danger of me losin' all my happiness <eos> For I love a man who doesn't know I exist <eos> And this you can fix, so <eos> Cupid, draw back your bow <eos> And let your arrow flow <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> Nobody but me <eos> Cupid, please hear my cry <eos> And let your arrow fly <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> Now if your arrow makes his love strong for me <eos> I swear I'm going to love him 'til eternity <eos> I know that, 'tween the both of us, his heart we can steal <eos> Cupid, help me if you will, so <eos> Cupid, draw back your bow <eos> And let your arrow flow <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> Nobody but me <eos> Cupid, please hear my cry <eos> And let your arrow fly <eos> Straight to my lover's heart for me <eos> Yeah, Cupid <eos> Oh, oh, Cupid, yeah <eos> Oh, Cupid <eos>

I am thinking it's a sign <eos> That the freckles in our eyes <eos> Are mirror images <eos> And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned <eos> And I have to speculate <eos> That God himself did make <eos> Us into corresponding shapes <eos> Like puzzle pieces from the clay <eos> And true, it may seem like a stretch <eos> But it's thoughts like this that catch <eos> My troubled head when you're away <eos> When I am missing you to death <eos> When you are out there on the road <eos> For several weeks of shows <eos> And when you scan the radio <eos> I hope this song will guide you home <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> I tried my best to leave <eos> This all on your machine <eos> But the persistent beat <eos> It sounded thin upon listening <eos> And that frankly will not fly <eos> You will hear the shrillest highs <eos> And lowest lows with the windows down <eos> When this is guiding you home <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> (They will see us waving from such great heights) <eos> (Come down now) <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> (Come down now) <eos> 
Karma police, arrest this man <eos> He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge <eos> He's like a detuned radio <eos> Karma police, arrest this girl <eos> Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill <eos> And we have crashed her party <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> Karma police, I've given all I can <eos> It's not enough, I've given all I can <eos> But we're still on the payroll <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> This is what you'll get <eos> When you mess with us <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> For a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> Phew, for a minute there <eos> I lost myself, I lost myself <eos> 
I don't believe in superstars <eos> Organic food and foreign cars <eos> I don't believe the price of gold <eos> The certainty of growing old <eos> That right is right and left is wrong <eos> That north and south can't get along <eos> That east is east and west is west <eos> And being first is always best <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos> Well I don't believe that heaven waits <eos> For only those who congregate <eos> I like to think of God as love <eos> He's down below, he's up above <eos> He's watchin' people, everywhere <eos> He knows who does and doesn't care <eos> And I'm an ordinary man <eos> Sometimes I wonder who I am <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in music <eos> I believe in magic <eos> And I believe in you <eos> I know with all my certainty <eos> What's going on with you and me <eos> Is a good thing <eos> It's true <eos> I believe in you <eos> I don't believe virginity <eos> Is as common as it used to be <eos> In working days and sleeping nights <eos> That black is black and white is white <eos> That Superman and Robin Hood <eos> Are still alive in Hollywood <eos> That gasoline's in short supply <eos> The rising cost of gettin' by <eos> But I believe in love <eos> I believe in old folks <eos> I believe in children <eos> I believe in you <eos> I believe in love <eos> I believe in babies <eos> I believe in mom and dad <eos> And I believe in you <eos> 
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside <eos> I'm not one of those who can easily hide <eos> I don't have much money, but, boy, if I did <eos> I'd buy a big house where we both could live <eos> If I was a sculptor, heh, but then again, no <eos> Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show <eos> I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do <eos> My gift is my song, and this one's for you <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss <eos> Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross <eos> But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song <eos> It's for people like you that keep it turned on <eos> So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do <eos> You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue <eos> Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean <eos> Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen <eos> And you can tell everybody this is your song <eos> It may be quite simple, but now that it's done <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos> I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind <eos> That I put down in words <eos> How wonderful life is while you're in the world <eos>

I've spent way too much time moving on <eos> Tried a couple of therapists <eos> Even got rid of some stuff <eos> It's like my mind got a mind of its own <eos> 'Cause I've been busy getting over <eos> Getting over someone <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like my skin isn't longing <eos> After the weight of your touch <eos> It's what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Someone left me with a broken heart <eos> That I passed on to someone <eos> And broke a new one apart <eos> Things can be good enough <eos> Still not enough <eos> And that's why I'm terrified <eos> Having you by my side <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like it ain't a habit <eos> Thinking 'bout "what if" too much <eos> Like what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> 
Wrote my whole life down in a notebook <eos> Songs about you and me <eos> I've been singing to every soul in Tennessee <eos> But nobody seems to listen <eos> And no one ever smiles the way that you do <eos> So I guess you'll never hear me on the radio <eos> And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine <eos> To hold you once more <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> I left home for Hollywood looking for a part to play <eos> Well, you always said I had such a pretty face <eos> But I guess I'm not that pretty <eos> 'Cause no one looks at me the way that you do <eos> Well, you'll always be a movie star to me <eos> And darlin', now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> Well, we're stuck here in these hills that they call mountains <eos> But darlin', back home in your arms is right where I want to be <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos>

I'm lost in the light <eos> I pray for the night <eos> To take me, to take you too <eos> After so many words <eos> Still nothing's heard <eos> Don't know what we should do <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> 'twas my greatest thrill <eos> When we just stood still <eos> You let me hold your hand 'til I had my fill <eos> Even counting sheep <eos> Don't help me sleep <eos> I just toss and turn right there beside ya <eos> So if someone could help me now <eos> They'd help you too <eos> They'd help you too <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> And I held my own <eos> Still I rattled your bones <eos> I said some awful things and I take them back <eos> If we would try again <eos> Just remember when <eos> Before we were lovers I swear we were friends <eos> So if someone could see me now <eos> Let them see you <eos> Let them see you <eos> See you through <eos> All the hard things we've all gotta do <eos> Cause this life is long <eos> So you wouldn't be wrong <eos> Being free, leaving me on my own <eos> 
How can someone stand so damn close <eos> And feel like they're worlds away? <eos> I can see your sad story eyes <eos> So how do you have no words to say? <eos> All I want is to fall in deeper <eos> Than I've ever been <eos> Why won't you let me? <eos> I can handle your heart, so help me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright <eos> Through the dark for the both of us <eos> And "I've done it outta love" is not enough <eos> But God, how I wish it was <eos> And I don't wanna find out <eos> How much lonely I can take before you lose me <eos> Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> I can't let it go <eos> From moments in your arms <eos> But they come back again <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> 
Letra de "Papum" com MC Kevinho <eos> Aê, Seleção! <eos> Eu vivo dizendo <eos> O muleque dos hits lançou mais uma, fio! <eos> Não para <eos> Dá uma reboladinha <eos> Repara <eos> Olha só pra essa menina <eos> Prepara <eos> E saia do seu comum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> Não para <eos> Dá uma reboladinha <eos> Repara <eos> Olha só pra essa menina <eos> Prepara <eos> E saia do seu comum <eos> E quando eu mandar, é papum <eos> Esse movimento que ela faz, papum <eos> Quando ela joga e vai pra trás, papum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> E quando eu mandar, é papum <eos> Esse movimento que ela faz, papum <eos> Quando ela joga e vai pra trás, papum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> E quando eu mandar, você já sabe né, fio! <eos> Aê Gabriel <eos> Vamo jogar junto, fio <eos> É só mandar pro gol e papum <eos> Essa já foi <eos> Não para <eos> Dá uma reboladinha <eos> Repara <eos> Olha só pra essa menina <eos> Prepara <eos> E saia do seu comum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> Não para <eos> Dá uma reboladinha <eos> Repara <eos> Olha só pra essa menina <eos> Prepara <eos> E saia do seu comum <eos> E quando eu mandar, é papum <eos> Esse movimento que ela faz, papum <eos> Quando ela joga e vai pra trás, papum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> E quando eu mandar, é papum <eos> Esse movimento que ela faz, papum <eos> Quando ela joga e vai pra trás, papum <eos> Hoje ela marca qualquer um <eos> E quando eu mandar, você já sabe né, fio! <eos> Quando for jogar, é papum <eos> 
Tonka trucks and G.I. Joes <eos> Jumping those hills with Luke and Bo <eos> Plastic cap guns and a swimming hole <eos> Don't get no dirt on your church clothes <eos> Win or lose, we cheer for the Braves <eos> Ten percent in the offering plate <eos> Sunday chicken and a NASCAR race <eos> Sure'd be nice to get back to that place <eos> There was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Eighteen, left it all behind <eos> Chasing a girl, chasing a dime <eos> Went so far tryna get mine <eos> I can't see that old porch light <eos> That led me home at night <eos> There was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> When we didn't have much <eos> I can still hear grandma reading <eos> That red letter Book of John <eos> I can still smell coffee in the kitchen <eos> With ol' Don Williams on <eos> And there was dirt on daddy's clothes <eos> From putting that bacon on mama's stove <eos> Dog barking in the yard at a truck we don't know <eos> All we had was us <eos> And that little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Had it all when we didn't have much <eos> Little bitty house and a lotta love <eos> We had it all when we didn't have much <eos> 
We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But I'm always looking forward for an open door <eos> I found an outlet for all my feelings <eos> They're trying to cut the cord <eos> I'm thinking we've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But there's always a place for you here in my wild heart <eos> I dream of you on a highway under a thousand stars <eos> We can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> We can have it all <eos> I can make it on my own <eos> We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> And you can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> 
When we were young and still in love <eos> We didn't care what we were made of <eos> Our eyes were set on a distant sun <eos> It was shimmering gold <eos> Then slowly one by one <eos> We carried our past and cradled the storm <eos> We tried to conceal the scars we wore <eos> 'Cause we couldn't show what we couldn't show <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments we share <eos> Love's truest meaning lives when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> And then the silence fell <eos> We bit our tongues, with which we tell <eos> All of our dreams, and the stories we sell <eos> But we didn't know what we didn't know <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> 
Hmm, mmmh, yeah, yeah <eos> Baby, please try to forgive me <eos> Stay here, don't put out the glow <eos> Hold me now don't bother <eos> If every minute it makes me weaker <eos> You can save me from the man <eos> That I've become, oh yeah <eos> Looking back on the things I've done <eos> I was trying to be someone <eos> I played my part, kept you in the dark <eos> Now let me show you the shape of my heart <eos> Sadness is beautiful <eos> Loneliness that's tragical <eos> So help me I can't win this war, oh no <eos> Touch me now, don't bother <eos> If every second it makes me weaker <eos> You can save me from the man I've become <eos> Looking back on the things I've done <eos> I was trying to be someone <eos> I played my part, kept you in the dark (in the dark) <eos> Now let me show you the shape of my heart <eos> I'm here with my confession <eos> Got nothing to hide no more <eos> I don't know where to start <eos> But to show you the shape of my heart <eos> I'm lookin' back on things I've done <eos> I never wanna play the same old part <eos> I'll keep you in the dark (keep you in the dark) <eos> Now let me show you the shape of my heart (heart!) <eos> Looking back on the things I've done <eos> I was trying to be someone (trying to be someone) <eos> I played my part, kept you in the dark <eos> Now let me show you the shape of my heart <eos> (Now let me show you the true shape of my heart!) <eos> Looking back on the things I've done <eos> I was trying to be someone <eos> I played my part, kept you in the dark <eos> Now let me show you the shape of... <eos> Show you the shape of my heart <eos> 
I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> What I give, it takes away <eos> Whether I go or when I stay <eos> I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> I see a fire out by the lake <eos> I'll drive my car without the brakes <eos> I see a mountain in my way <eos> It's looming larger by the day <eos> I see a darkness in my fate <eos> I'll drive my car without the brakes <eos> Oh, gimme some time <eos> Show me the foothold from which I can climb <eos> Yeah, when I feel low <eos> You show me a signpost for where I should go <eos> I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> And my desire wears a dark dress <eos> Ah, each day, I see you less <eos> Oh, gimme some time <eos> Show me the foothold from which I can climb <eos> Yeah, when I feel low <eos> You show me a signpost for where I should go <eos> Through lanes and stone rows <eos> Black granite, wind blows <eos> Fire lake and far flame <eos> Go now but come again <eos> Dark clouds gather 'round <eos> Will I run or stand my ground? <eos> Oh, when I come to climb <eos> Show me the mountain so far behind <eos> Yeah, it's farther away <eos> Its shadow gets smaller day after day <eos> Yeah, gimme my way <eos> Gimme my love <eos> Gimme my choice <eos> You keep me coming around <eos> Gimme my fate <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my voice <eos> You keep me coming around <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my <eos> Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way <eos> Gimme my fate <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my choice <eos> You keep me coming 'round <eos>

En el pasado y me pone a imaginar <eos> Si mañana te quedas o mañana tú te vas <eos> Yo te amaba mucho, eso no voy a negar <eos> ¿Cómo iba saber que conmigo no sentías igual? <eos> Tu falsedad lo único que me supistes a dar <eos> Mientras yo aquí entregándote lo que tú me pidas <eos> Me lo hiciste mal, eso no se va perdonar <eos> Por tu culpa es imposible pa' volver a amar <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedan bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Todo por tu culpa, chiquitita <eos> Puro Porte Diferente <eos> Mi corazón no tiene sentido, es una piedra <eos> Se acabó el cariño que adentro yo tenía <eos> No tengo motivación para yo continuar <eos> Mi vida se ha acabado desde que tú ya no estás <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedo bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Y puro Rancho Humilde <eos> 
There is hope for us <eos> There is distance between you and I <eos> We have just enough <eos> And it comes as no surprise <eos> I was in between <eos> You were matches and kerosene <eos> Is your conscience clear? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Did you celebrate without me? <eos> Did you tell them all about me? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Does it get you off <eos> To get it off your chest? <eos> Such an awful year <eos> Such an awful mess <eos> You can't write <eos> You can't sing <eos> You can't do anything at all <eos> Is there someone here? <eos> Can you make the call? <eos> Please, make the call <eos> And the ambulance is here <eos> And if I haven't made it clear... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Is there hope for us? <eos> There are constants that we can't define <eos> Is it all used up? <eos> Are we out of time? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> Well, if you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Now, the ambulance is here <eos> And if I still haven't made it clear <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> 
An angel whispered to me when I woke this morning <eos> That I would find heaven by my side <eos> And there you were you angel, heaven in the morning <eos> Laying in my arms and in my life <eos> And I reached this decision, I love you, my religion <eos> That is in my soul and in my heart <eos> No one could ever change my mind, oh, no <eos> 'Cause I got you here right by my side <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> You are my love <eos> Make me sing la di da <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take you away <eos> (Won't let them take you away, take you, baby) <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> If angels whispered to you early every morning <eos> It's really something wonderful and rare <eos> I get up in the morning feeling that forever <eos> I have all your love and all your care <eos> If someone tries to tell that I do not love you <eos> Tell them they must be out of their mind <eos> I ain't gonna let them change my mind, oh, no <eos> 'Cause I got you here right by my side <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> Make me sing la di da <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take you away <eos> (Won't let them take, take you, baby) <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> Make me sing la di da <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take you away <eos> (Won't let them take) <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> Make me sing la di da <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> Darling, I, oh <eos> I won't let them take you away <eos> I won't let them take you <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> Make me sing la di da <eos> You are my love <eos> (You are my love) <eos> You are my heaven, oh <eos> You are my love <eos> 
Y tú me vuelves loco <eos> Ay, no me mires con esos ojos de aventura <eos> No me trates como si fuera diversión <eos> No te muevas de esa manera cuando pasas <eos> Que me dejas con una extraña sensación <eos> No sugieras extravagancias con tu risa <eos> No me enseñes la gloria en cada movimiento <eos> Que tu juego me mortifica y la vida se me complica <eos> Y no quieras saber las cosas que yo invento <eos> Pues me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Cuando yo te miro, china, pero no te toco <eos> Y me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Ay, si yo pudiera, mamá, aunque fuera un poco <eos> No camines con ese paso que provoca <eos> No te sientes en esa pose tan sensual <eos> Y no bailes de esa manera, que bailando me desesperas <eos> Y me lleno de tanto bien que me hace mal <eos> Pues me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Cuando yo te miro, china, pero no te toco <eos> Y me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Ay, si yo pudiera, mamá, aunque fuera un poco <eos> Pues me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Cuando yo te miro, china, pero no te toco <eos> Y me vuelves loco, tú me vuelves loco <eos> Ay, si yo pudiera, mamá, aunque fuera un poco <eos> ¿Qué, qué, qué? <eos> (Tú me vuelves loco, que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Cuando caminas de esa manera me vuelves loco, corazón <eos> (Tú me vuelves loco, que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Te miro, pero no te toco, si yo pudiera aunque fuera un poco <eos> (Tú me vuelves loco, que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> ¡Ahí es! <eos> (Tú me vuelves loco, que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Me paro en la esquina y te veo pasar <eos> Y una extraña sensación me da <eos> (Tú me vuelves loco, que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Y cuando te pones así a bailar <eos> Me haces tanto bien que me hace mal <eos> (Tú me vuelves) ¿Ehh? (Loco) <eos> ¿Gachimba! <eos> ¿Qué, qué, qué? (Loco) <eos> (Que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Mujer, me vuelves loco <eos> (Que tú me vuelves—) <eos> Cuando, cuando te miro al pasar <eos> (Que tú me vuelves loco) <eos> Sin movimientos, y me veo loco <eos> (Que tú me vuelves—) <eos> Mientras camines de esa manera, mamita <eos> Me vuelves ¡loco! <eos> (Loco) <eos> ¡Ay-ay-ay! <eos> ¡Loco! <eos>

Should I give up sunsets for marigold mornings? <eos> Should I look for rainbows or wait for the rain? <eos> Is happiness on the highway? Or is it parked in the driveway? <eos> Should I lean on you, babe? Or should you lean on me? <eos> Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape? <eos> Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way? <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> Caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> One heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> I could plant a pretty garden or just send myself flowers <eos> Be a jet-set Friday or a Sunday hometown girl <eos> I could stay a little lonely or let you get to know me <eos> Yeah, I could love a picket fence if it wrapped around the world <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> Caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> I'm one heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Am I looking for comfort? Am I looking for an escape? <eos> Am I looking for you? Am I looking the other way? <eos> I'm a wild child and a homing pigeon <eos> A caravan and an empty kitchen <eos> Bare feet on the tile with my head up in the clouds <eos> One heart goin' both directions <eos> One love and a couple of questions <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Am I settlin' up or settlin' down? <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> 
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold <eos> Like a scene from a movie <eos> That every broken heart knows <eos> We were walking on moonlight <eos> When you pulled me close <eos> Split second and you disappeared <eos> And I was all alone <eos> I woke up in tears <eos> With you by my side <eos> A breath of relief <eos> And I realized <eos> No, we're not promised tomorrow <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you <eos> I'm gonna hold you <eos> Like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing <eos> I won't take you for granted <eos> Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos> In the blink of an eye <eos> Just a whisper of smoke <eos> You could lose everything <eos> The truth is, you never know <eos> So I'll kiss you longer, baby <eos> Any chance that I get <eos> I'll make the most of the minutes <eos> And love with no regret <eos> Let's take our time to say what we want <eos> Use what we got before it's all gone <eos> No, we're not promised tomorrow <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you <eos> I'm gonna hold you <eos> Like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing <eos> I won't take you for granted <eos> Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you <eos> I'm gonna love you <eos> Like we're saying goodbye <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos> Like I'm gonna lose you <eos> I'm gonna hold you <eos> Like I'm saying goodbye <eos> Wherever we're standing <eos> I won't take you for granted <eos> Cause we'll never know when <eos> When we'll run out of time <eos> So I'm gonna love you <eos>

"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> 
Hooray it's Christmas time <eos> But there's one lousy tradition <eos> There's a certain show that you will see <eos> That is all and many would agree <eos> It is time to find another show to substitute <eos> For the Nutcracker <eos> I'm watching the game <eos> But something's wrong <eos> Staring is my wife <eos> Her face looks long <eos> I know that look, it must be me <eos> It's not our anniversary <eos> I shrug, no clue <eos> What did I do <eos> She stands in disbelief (What?) <eos> This holiday scene brings no laughter <eos> Forced going to see The Nutcracker <eos> I try to block it from my mind <eos> Think fast, what reason can I find? <eos> Got work to do, I'll fake the flu <eos> No chance, I'm done, I'm screwed (No!) <eos> I've seen the Nutcracker twenty times <eos> Sure it is fun if you are four (bum) <eos> Don't call me a Scrooge 'cause it's a bore <eos> The story's dated and that Mouse King thing <eos> Freaks me out (Ahh!) <eos> Well, guess I'm a guy, what can I say <eos> I'd rather watch football than ballet <eos> I try my hardest not to groan <eos> And pull the score up on my phone <eos> As I complain, "It's not the same" <eos> We're rushing out the door (Go!) <eos> All holiday shoppers on the road <eos> My holiday spirit might explode <eos> Of course, there is no place to park <eos> We're late, the theatre's in the dark <eos> In no small feat, we find a seat <eos> The show's about to start (Shh) <eos> Here's that song from Tetris <eos> And I know it's the part <eos> When I fight not to fall asleep <eos> March the wooden soldiers <eos> Bunch of mice start a fight <eos> Land of sweets, man this stuff's trippy <eos> By the way, this story makes no sense <eos> Still don't know what it means <eos> After all these years <eos> So confusing, feel like snoozing <eos> Eyes are heavy, as I start to dream <eos> Woah, I'm awake, must have fallen asleep <eos> Guess I didn't snore or make a peep <eos> 'Cause my wife had no clue I'd been out cold <eos> Is the finale coming up <eos> 'Cause there is no beer left in my cup <eos> To make it through, I'll need another drink <eos> Snuck out to the lobby <eos> Oh, look, I found a TV <eos> I forgot the game was happening <eos> It's down to the wire <eos> Time will soon expire <eos> Down by one, this kick would win it <eos> (Hut, hut) The ball snapped <eos> (Oh, no) The kick's bad <eos> (Wide right) No <eos> (We lost) No <eos> How could this night get any worse? <eos> Now I'm feeling all depressed <eos> But I still have to act impressed <eos> A pirouette, oh wow, that's great <eos> A six-year-old could do that, too <eos> Saw my team lose at the bar <eos> Now dancing dudes in leotards <eos> Last Nutcracker hopefully <eos> But my wife's thinking differently <eos> She leans in closely, whispers softly <eos> "Can't wait for you to take me next year." <eos> 
Two weeks and I wait 'til the feeling hits <eos> Maybe I just haven't let it sink in <eos> For three years we were living together <eos> Held me like you'd hold me forever <eos> Didn't think that heartbreak would feel like this <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> From every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> But I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> Patience is a thing that I learned from you <eos> That some things can feel wrong even though they're true <eos> Went through all the hard times together <eos> Kept me calm when I'd lose my temper <eos> I'm just really grateful that I had you <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> Every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> And I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> I wish it did <eos> When I wish it did <eos> From everything to nothing at all <eos> From every day to never at all <eos> And everyone says that I should be sad <eos> Is it normal that <eos> I don't feel sorry for myself <eos> Care if your hands touch somebody else <eos> Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy <eos> It's okay if you forget me <eos> I don't feel empty now that you're gone <eos> Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all? <eos> And I'll tell you what the worst is <eos> It's the way it doesn't hurt <eos> When I wish it did <eos> I wish it did <eos> 
Alas my love you do me wrong <eos> To cast me out discourteously <eos> When I have loved you so so long <eos> Delighting in your company <eos> Your gown was of the grassy green <eos> Your sleeves of satin were hanging by <eos> Which made you be a harvest queen <eos> Yet you would not love me <eos> Green sleeves was my all my joy <eos> Green sleeves was my delight <eos> Green sleeves was my heart of gold <eos> And who but my lady green sleeves <eos> Alas my love you do me wrong <eos> To cast me out discourteously <eos> When I have loved you so so long <eos> Delighting in your company <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos> 
Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie <eos> Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre supe aceptarme <eos> De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores <eos> Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí <eos> Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel <eos> Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte <eos> Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me alejé y en cambio quise <eos> Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas <eos> Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia; <eos> Y siempre me estoy imaginando <eos> Las veces que él te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos <eos> Me muero de envidia <eos> Envidia, queriendo ser luna en la noche <eos> Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche <eos> Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre <eos> Y amarte hasta que se te olvide... su nombre <eos> Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad <eos> El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena <eos> Que será mi condena... que me va a matar <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Ay me muero de envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia y te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> No sé lo que me pasa, esta maldita envidia <eos> Que va a acabar conmigo yo lo sé, si no te hago mía <eos> Va contra mis principios mi moral, querer amar a una mujer que es ajena <eos> Vivir así no puedo más, en esta agonía <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> Te digo no puedo más <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> No puedo, no puedo más <eos> 
Ya que vienes hasta aquí <eos> Llévame lejos de mi <eos> Derríteme la piel poquito a poco <eos> Hazme ver el fin <eos> Convénceme <eos> Convénceme <eos> Confiésame el amor <eos> Y deja ya el temor, respira <eos> Confiésame tú amor <eos> Que el tiempo se nos va, respira bebé <eos> Y hablé con la noche pa' que no amanezca <eos> Pa' poderla disfrutar entera <eos> Y hablé con la luna pa' que no se fuera <eos> Pa' que me puedas bеber entera <eos> Pa' quе me puedas beber entera <eos> Como fogata en verano, bebé <eos> Sóplame el aire en la cara <eos> Juega un ratito conmigo, bebé <eos> En el sofá o en la cama <eos> Como fogata en verano, bebé <eos> Sóplame el aire en la cara <eos> Juega un ratito conmigo, bebé <eos> En el sofá o en la cama <eos> Mmmm en la cama <eos> Confiésame el amor <eos> Y deja ya el temor, respira <eos> Confiésame tú amor <eos> Que el tiempo se nos va, respira bebé <eos> Y hablé con la noche pa' que no amanezca <eos> Pa' poderla disfrutar entera <eos> Y hablé con la luna pa' que no se fuera <eos> Pa' que me puedas beber entera <eos> Y hablé con la noche pa' que no amanezca <eos> Pa' poderla disfrutar entera <eos> Y hablé con la luna pa' que no se fuera <eos> Pa' que me puedas beber entera <eos> Pa' que me puedas beber entera <eos> Como fogata en verano, bebé <eos> Sóplame el aire en la cara <eos> Juega un ratito conmigo, bebé <eos> En el sofá o en la cama <eos> Como fogata en verano, bebé <eos> Sóplame el aire en la cara <eos> Juega un ratito conmigo, bebé <eos> En el sofá o en la cama <eos> 
Come a little bit closer hear what I have to say <eos> Just like children sleeping we can dream this night away <eos> But there's a full moon rising let's go dancing in the night <eos> We go where the music's playing let's go out and feel the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> When we were strangers I watched you from afar <eos> When we were lovers I loved you with all my heart <eos> But now it's getting late and the moon is climbing high <eos> I want to celebrate see it shining in the night <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> Because I'm still in love with you I want to see you dance again <eos> Because I'm still in love with you on this harvest moon <eos> 
Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos> 
Tal vez te olvides de mi <eos> Tal vez me olvide de ti <eos> Pero esta vez aprendi <eos> Que no se debe mentir <eos> De una promesa vivi <eos> Hoy ya no puedo seguir <eos> Creyendo en ti <eos> Cada momento voy tropenzando <eos> En desamor <eos> Es que no queda nada entre tu y yo <eos> Si estoy llorando <eos> Y no es que te extrañe el corazon <eos> Es que a tu lado aprendi el dolor <eos> CORO <eos> No podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> Estare en tu piel <eos> Cada momento en donde estes <eos> Siempre habra un lugar <eos> Cada recuerdo que sera <eos> Un eterno suspirar <eos> Si estoy llorando <eos> No es que te extrañe el corazon <eos> Es que a tu lado aprendi el dolor <eos> No podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> Estare en tu piel <eos> Cada momento en donde estes <eos> Siempre habra un lugar <eos> Cada recuerdo que sera <eos> Un eterno suspirar <eos> No Podras <eos> Olvidar que te ame <eos> Como yo nunca imagine <eos> 
Oh, oh, ooh <eos> Ooh, no <eos> Oh, oh, ooh woah, ooh woah, ooh, ooh <eos> How did I lose you? (How did I lose you?) <eos> How did I blow that? How can we go back? <eos> Why did I not choose you? Ooh-ooh <eos> Instead of a good time, I wasted your good time <eos> I should've been everything I promised <eos> I should've not had to learn it from this <eos> You shoulda been first <eos> I know it's emotional, but you're not emotional, she said <eos> I should be crying but I just can't let it show <eos> I should be crying but I can't stop thinking <eos> All the things you should've said that you never said <eos> All the things you should've done that you never did <eos> Always said, "I don't know what I should be feeling" <eos> Oh, darling <eos> I've been stupid, thoughtless <eos> I've been useless, heartless <eos> I've been violating and thinking it wasn't ever gonna catch up <eos> I wasn't ever gonna 'fess up, and that's real <eos> I should've been everything I promised (I should've been) <eos> I should've not had to learn it from this (Hmm-hmm) <eos> You shoulda been first (Oh my God) <eos> I know it's emotional, but you're not emotional, she said <eos> I should be crying but I just can't let it show <eos> I should be crying but I can't stop thinking <eos> All the things you should've said that you never said <eos> All the things you should've done that you never did <eos> Always said, "I don't know what I should be feeling" <eos> Oh, darling <eos> Please (Cry) <eos> Shoulda known you're feeling something, please (Cry) <eos> 'Cause if it hurts, I know you still care (Cry) <eos> 'Cause if you don't, I know you're over it (Cry) <eos> Oh, please, girl (Cry) <eos> So that I know you're feeling something, please (Cry) <eos> 'Cause if it hurts I know you still care (Cry) <eos> 'Cause if you don't, then I know you're over it (Cry) <eos> Oh, she said, she said, she said, yeah <eos> I should be crying but I just can't let it show (Can't let it show) <eos> I should be crying but I can't stop thinking (I can't stop thinking, yeah) <eos> All the things we should've said that you never said (Oh, oh, yeah) <eos> All the things you should've done that you never did (I should've done) <eos> Always said, "I don't know what I should be feeling" (What I should be doing) <eos> Oh, darling <eos> Make it go <eos> Make it go away <eos> 
My thoughts awake <eos> When dark shadows swallow my eyes <eos> Then I grasp you <eos> Out of me and listen <eos> To the breath of your step in me <eos> Your image is so much closer <eos> As it rips my nights <eos> And scattered by days <eos> It returns into my silence <eos> I gather you in me <eos> And begin to understand <eos> Be my playground of intimacy <eos> Voilence of endearment <eos> You have to inhale if you want to breath <eos> Tired views fall down <eos> Soft bounce without sound <eos> Blurring colours of shattering brains <eos> Warm salivation <eos> Shuttered expression <eos> The aromatic shades of darkness <eos> A red breath whispers in the rivers <eos> The screaming of drowning tongues <eos> A black breath whispers in your bloodlines <eos> You have to inhale <eos> If you want to breath <eos> 
A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos> 
You take a mortal man <eos> And put him in control <eos> Watch him become a god <eos> Watch people's heads a'roll <eos> A'roll, a'roll... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos> Actin' like a robot <eos> Its metal brain corrodes <eos> You try to take its pulse <eos> Before the head explodes <eos> Explodes, explodes... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos> The Earth starts to rumble <eos> World powers fall <eos> A'warring for the heavens <eos> A peaceful man stands tall <eos> A'tall, a'tall... <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Just like the Pied Piper <eos> Led rats through the streets <eos> We dance like marionettes <eos> Swaying to the symphony <eos> Swaying to the symphony of destruction <eos> 
I remember when I was a lad <eos> Times were hard and things were bad <eos> But there's a silver lining behind every cloud <eos> Just poor people, that's all we were <eos> Trying to make a living out of black land dirt <eos> We'd get together in a family circle singing loud <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> Singing seems to help a troubled soul <eos> One of these days and it won't be long <eos> I'll rejoin them in a song <eos> I'm going to join the family circle at the throne <eos> No, the circle won't be broken <eos> By and by, Lord, by and by <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Now I remember after work <eos> Mama would call in all of us <eos> You could hear us singing for a country mile <eos> Now little brother has done gone on <eos> But, I'll rejoin him in a song <eos> We'll be together again up yonder in a little while <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Daddy sang bass <eos> Mama sang tenor <eos> Me and little brother would join right in there <eos> In the sky, Lord, in the sky <eos> Songwriter:  Carl Perkins <eos> 
Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime lo que sientes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> Cuando llamas a mi puerta <eos> Voy a abrir <eos> Y ya no estás (no estás, no estás) <eos> Quizá me habré explicado mal (y tan mal) <eos> O eres tú que no me entiendes <eos> Da igual <eos> To' lo que haces no es pensando en mi <eos> Y yo escribiendo cosas para ti <eos> Escucho tus silеncios pa' dormir <eos> Te da igual <eos> Si me voy <eos> Te da igual <eos> Ya no еstoy <eos> Baby, ¿por qué odiabas verme? <eos> Hacerte reír <eos> Lock the door, cierra la puerta <eos> Que me quede a oscuras <eos> Como si estoy en Berghain <eos> Huye y lárgate de mi ciudad <eos> Se que no todo va a ser igual <eos> Let's go <eos> Baby no queda tiempo <eos> Días que pasan lentos <eos> Y si tú no vuelves, yo te hago voodoo <eos> Voy a maldecirte clavarte en la cruz <eos> Maybe ya da igual, no importa lo que diga <eos> Te da igual <eos> Dime ma, ¿qué hice mal? <eos> Te da igual, te da igual <eos> A ti te da igual <eos> To' lo que haces no es pensando en mi <eos> Y yo escribiendo cosas para ti <eos> Escucho tus silencios pa' dormir <eos> Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime lo que sientes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime que me quieres <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> 
Ich steige in ein Flugzeug ein <eos> Es wird kalt, ich hör' es schrei'n <eos> Ich kenne meine Sitzplatznummer <eos> Panik reitet großen Kummer <eos> Ich näher' mich der Klagereihe <eos> Immer lauter das Geschreie <eos> Der Angst weicht nun Gewissheit hier <eos> Ein Kleinkind sitzt gleich neben mir <eos> Hier die Frage aller Klassen: <eos> „Darf und kann man Kinder hassen?“ <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Der Schreihals turnt jetzt her und hin <eos> Die Mutter blättert ein Magazin <eos> Spricht stumm zum Kind, während sie liest <eos> Und dabei einen Apfel isst <eos> Der liebe Herr Gott will mich strafen <eos> Die Nervensäge will nicht schlafen <eos> Hört überhaupt nicht auf zu schrei'n <eos> Der Vater schläft längst wie ein Stein <eos> Hier die Frage aller Klassen: <eos> „Kann und muss man Kinder hassen?“ <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Nein, ich liebe sie <eos> Ja, ich liebe sie <eos> Die Großen und die Kleinen <eos> Doch es müssen meine sein <eos> Doch ganz plötzlich wird es still <eos> Es lacht mich an, ich bin verzückt <eos> Streck' die Hand aus nach dem Kleinen <eos> Da fängt es wieder an zu schrei'n <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Nein, ich liebe sie <eos> Ja, ich liebe sie <eos> Die Großen und die Kleinen <eos> Doch es müssen meine sein <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Ich hasse Kinder <eos> Hier kommt die Frage aller Fragen: <eos> „Kann und muss man Kinder schlagen?“ <eos> Nein, ich liebe sie <eos> Ja, ich liebe sie <eos> Alle Kinder, groß und klein <eos> Doch sie sollten meine sein <eos>

When I became of age, my mother called me to her side <eos> She said, "Son you're growing up now <eos> Pretty soon you'll take a bride" <eos> And then she said <eos> Just because you've become a young man now <eos> There's still some things that you don't understand now <eos> Before you ask some girl for her hand now <eos> Keep your freedom for as long as you can now <eos> My mama told me, you better shop around <eos> Oh yeah, you better shop around <eos> Oh, there's some things that I want you to know now <eos> Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now <eos> The women come and the women gonna go now <eos> Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now <eos> Try to get yourself a bargain, son <eos> Don't be sold on the very first one <eos> Pretty girls come a dime a dozen <eos> Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving <eos> Before you take a girl and say, "I do" now <eos> Make sure that her love is true now <eos> Before you take a girl and say, "I do" now <eos> Make sure she's in love with you now <eos> Make sure that her love is true now <eos> I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now <eos> Oh don't let the first one get you <eos> Oh no cause I don't wanna see her with you <eos> Oh before you let her hold you tight <eos> Oh make sure she's alright <eos> Oh before you let 'em take your hand my son <eos> Understand my son, be a man my son <eos> I know you can my son, I love you <eos>

She played tambourine with a silver jingle <eos> And she must have known the words to at least a million tunes <eos> But the one most requested by the man she knew as cowboy <eos> Was the late night benediction at the y'all come back saloon <eos> In a voice soft and trembling <eos> She'd sing her song to cowboy as a smokey halo circled round her raven hair <eos> And all the fallen angels and pinball playing rounders <eos> Stopped the games that they'd been playing for the losers evening prayer <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Every night in the shadows thinking back on Amarillo <eos> He'd dream of better days and ask for faded love <eos> Lifting high his glass in honor of the lady and her song <eos> He paid his check then lonely walked the broken cowboy home <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos> Faded love and faded memories how they linger in her mind <eos> Miles and years played the cowboy like an old melody out of tune and out of time <eos>

I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way <eos> Seems like yesterday <eos> I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away <eos> I've never been the same <eos> I felt the strangest feeling <eos> Like a raging fire it burned <eos> She left, I cried for weeks <eos> And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away <eos> Had to earn my pay <eos> Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say <eos> It only ended up the same way <eos> And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone? <eos> Oh, girl, you answered my question <eos> This time it's working, you've given me new hope <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you <eos> It's got a power of its own <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> (Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho <eos> (Love changes) Let's make love <eos> (Love changes everything) Oh <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl (Love changes) <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos>

Crazy <eos> I'm crazy for feeling so lonely <eos> I'm crazy <eos> Crazy for feeling so blue <eos> I knew <eos> You'd love me as long as you wanted <eos> And then some day <eos> You'd leave me for somebody new <eos> Worry <eos> Why do I let myself worry? <eos> Wondering <eos> What in the world did I do? <eos> Oh, crazy <eos> For thinking that my love could hold you <eos> I'm crazy for trying <eos> And crazy for crying <eos> And I'm crazy for loving you <eos> Crazy <eos> For thinking that my love could hold you <eos> I'm crazy for trying <eos> And crazy for crying <eos> And I'm crazy for loving you <eos>

What good's a highway without a destination? <eos> What good's a house without someone to come home to? <eos> What's a night at the top of the world without you there beside me? <eos> No, there ain't no good in it without you <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos> Still got the tendency to lean over the edges <eos> I still got the urge to chase the dream until it ends <eos> You don't fence me in <eos> Yeah, you understand <eos> But when I can't remember <eos> You remind me who I am <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Follow me, I need you right now <eos> Cover me up <eos> And settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos>

Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> When that sun is high in that Texas sky <eos> I'll be bucking at the county fair <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo I'll be there <eos> They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe <eos> Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way <eos> Well I'll be looking for eight when they pull that gate <eos> And I hope that judge ain't blind <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind <eos> Amarillo by morning, up from San Antone <eos> Everything that I've got is just what I've got on <eos> I ain't got a dime, but what I got is mine <eos> I ain't rich, but Lord I'm free <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's where I'll be <eos> 
I heard the bells on Christmas day <eos> Their old familiar carols play <eos> And wild and sweet the words repeat <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> I thought how, as the day had come <eos> The belfries of all Christendom <eos> Had rolled along the unbroken song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> And in despair I bowed my head: <eos> “There is no peace on earth, ” I said <eos> “For hate is strong and mocks the song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos> Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: <eos> “God is not dead, nor does he sleep; <eos> The wrong shall fail, the right prevail <eos> With peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos>

Games, changes and fears <eos> When will they go from here? <eos> When will they stop? <eos> I believe that fate has brought us here <eos> And we should be together, babe <eos> But we're not <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> I may appear to be free <eos> But I'm just a prisoner of your love <eos> And I may seem alright and smile when you leave <eos> But my smiles are just a front <eos> Just a front, hey! <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Here is my confession <eos> May I be your possession? <eos> Boy, I need your touch <eos> Your love, kisses, and such <eos> With all my might, I try <eos> But this I can't deny <eos> Deny <eos> I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you <eos> (But I'm dreaming of you, babe) <eos> I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning <eos> I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble (Oh!) <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Yeah, yeah, yeah!) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble (Hey, yeah, yeah!) <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear (Sick of love) <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near (Love, your love, kisses ends) <eos> Goodbye and I choke (Goodbye and I choke, yeah) <eos> I try to walk away and I stumble <eos> Though I try to hide it, it's clear <eos> My world crumbles when you are not near <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> 
Con tus besos me haces sentir bien <eos> Simplemente me encanta tu forma de ser <eos> Cuando caminas matas a cualquier hombre <eos> Y yo contigo neta si me enamoré <eos> Me traes bien loco todo el día pensándote <eos> Me atrevería llevarte banda tal vez <eos> Escribirte canciones, gritar tu nombre <eos> Se me hace que ya tengo con quien <eos> Vivir la vida, recorrerla constante <eos> Conocer lugares románticos también <eos> Llevarte a la luna o bajártela adónde <eos> Tú quieras, mija, sabes por ti pelearé <eos> Seré el hombre que te dé lo que tú desees <eos> Yo sé muy bien con verte que tú me quieres <eos> Cuando estoy contigo se me va el martirio <eos> Tú me tranquilizas al hablar bonito <eos> Ahí estás cuando te necesito <eos> Completas mi vida como un libro <eos> Error no has tenido, perfecta te miro <eos> Y si algún día es que discutimos <eos> Sé que nuestro amor no es desunido <eos> Pase lo que pase estarás conmigo <eos> Nada es mejor que acariciarte <eos> Todas las noches recorrer tu bella piel <eos> Hermosa siempre sin o con maquillaje <eos> Tu vestidura tan casual no pretendes <eos> Por eso me enamoré la primera vez <eos> Supe contigo iba ser diferente <eos> Ojalá que lo nuestro nunca se acabe <eos> La piel se me enchina cuando tú te arrimas <eos> Tu linda sonrisa, eso me cautiva <eos> Por el oído dices cosillas <eos> Muerdes tus labios y me hipnotizas <eos> Cierra las cortinas, prende unas velitas <eos> Lo que quiero ahorita, tú lo quieres igual <eos> Esta rola va pa' ti, mi niña <eos> Mil gracias por tenerme en tu vida <eos> 
She can kill with a smile <eos> She can wound with her eyes <eos> And she can ruin your faith with her casual lies <eos> And she only reveals <eos> What she wants you to see <eos> She hides like a child <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> She can lead you to love <eos> She can take you or leave you <eos> She can ask for the truth <eos> But she'll never believe you <eos> And she'll take what you give her <eos> As long as it's free <eos> Yeah, she steals like a thief <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> And she'll promise you more <eos> Than the Garden of Eden <eos> Then she'll carelessly cut you <eos> And laugh while you're bleedin' <eos> But she'll bring out the best <eos> And the worst you can be <eos> Blame it all on yourself <eos> Cause she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mmm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mm <eos> Oh, she takes care of herself <eos> She can wait if she wants <eos> She's ahead of her time <eos> Oh, and she never gives out <eos> And she never gives in <eos> She just changes her mind <eos> She is frequently kind <eos> And she's suddenly cruel <eos> She can do as she pleases <eos> She's nobody's fool <eos> But she can't be convicted <eos> She's earned her degree <eos> And the most she will do <eos> Is throw shadows at you <eos> But she's always a woman to me <eos> Mmm mm, mmm mm <eos> Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm <eos> 
I bet you're wondering how I knew <eos> 'Bout your plans to make me blue <eos> With some other guy you knew before <eos> Between the two of us guys <eos> You know I love you more <eos> It took me by surprise, I must say <eos> When I found out yesterday <eos> Don't you know that <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> I know a man ain't supposed to cry <eos> But these tears I can't hold inside <eos> Losing you would end my life you see <eos> Because you mean that much to me <eos> You could have told me yourself <eos> That you love someone else <eos> Instead <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> And I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> People say "believe half of what you see <eos> Son and none of what you hear" <eos> But I can't help being confused <eos> If it's true please tell me dear: <eos> Do you plan to let me go <eos> For the other guy you loved before? <eos> Don't you know <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine, baby <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> 
If you want me to stay <eos> I'll be around today <eos> To be available for you to see <eos> But I am about to go <eos> And then you'll know <eos> For me to stay here I got to be me <eos> You'll never be in doubt <eos> That's what it's all about <eos> You can't take me for granted and smile <eos> Count the days I'm gone <eos> Forget reachin' me by phone <eos> Because I promise I'll be gone for a while <eos> And when you see me again <eos> I hope that you have been <eos> The kind of person....that you really are now <eos> Got to get in straight <eos> How could I ever be late <eos> When you're my woman taking up my time <eos> Whoa, oh how could I ever allow <eos> I guess I wonder how <eos> I could get out a pocket for fun (HOW HOW) <eos> When you know that you're never number two <eos> Number one's gonna be number one <eos> Ohh oww oohh <eos> I'll be good <eos> I wish I could <eos> I get this message over to you now <eos> And when you see me again <eos> I hope that you have been <eos> The kind of person....that you really are now <eos> I'll be so good <eos> I wish I could <eos> I get this message over to you now <eos>

A cold beer's got twelve ounces <eos> A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand <eos> You only get so much until it's gone <eos> Duracells in a Maglite <eos> A needle drop on a forty-five <eos> Are the kinda things that only last so long <eos> When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old <eos> Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> The FM station on the outskirts <eos> Blue jeans after years of shift work <eos> All fadin' out like I always knew they would <eos> The strings on this guitar <eos> The first love lost on a young heart <eos> Those things are gonna break after the getting's good <eos> 'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old <eos> Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> Just a T-shirt in the kitchen <eos> With no make-up and a million <eos> Other things that I could look at my whole life <eos> A love like that makes a man have second thoughts <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> They say nothing lasts forever <eos> But they ain't seen us together <eos> Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes <eos> And I know there'll be that moment <eos> The good Lord calls one of us home and <eos> One won't have the other by their side <eos> But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long <eos> Maybe some things last forever after all <eos> After all <eos> 
You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust <eos> Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye <eos> Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms <eos> You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos left in the dark <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye <eos> Your lips, my lips <eos> Apocalypse <eos> Your lips, my lips <eos> Apocalypse <eos> Go and sneak us through the rivers <eos> Flood is rising up on your knees <eos> Oh, please <eos> Come out and haunt me, I know you want me <eos> Come out and haunt me <eos> Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids <eos> Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> Got the music in you baby, tell me why <eos> You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye <eos> You've been locked in here forever and you just can't say goodbye <eos> Oh, when you're all alone <eos> I will reach for you <eos> When you're feeling low <eos> I will be there too <eos> 
I am drowning at a party <eos> I can't wait to be alone <eos> I keep running for a reason <eos> People I could call my own <eos> They don't know me <eos> So I leave early <eos> And I, will go, in tears again <eos> Oh I, should've learned to hide within <eos> I stand under running water <eos> Water running down my back <eos> I'm back to running for a reason <eos> Words that I can not take back <eos> Oh they don't know me <eos> Do they think I'm boring <eos> They don't know me <eos> So I leave early <eos> And I, will go, in tears again <eos> Oh I, should've learned to hide within <eos> (Do they think I'm boring?) <eos> Oh I, will go in tears again <eos> (?) <eos> (Do they think I'm boring?) <eos> Oh I, should've learned to hide within <eos> (?) <eos> (Do they think I'm boring?) <eos> (Do they think I'm boring?) <eos> I can't wait to leave early <eos> Oh I, I can't wait to leave early <eos> Oh I, I can't wait to leave early <eos> (Think I'm leaving) <eos> 
I was born in a crossfire hurricane, well <eos> And I howled at my ma, at the driving rain, ooh yeah <eos> But it's alright, oh, that is a gas <eos> I said, it's all right <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas, oh yeah <eos> I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag, yeah <eos> I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes, I was <eos> But it's alright, and that is a gas <eos> I said, it's all right <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash is a g-g-gas <eos> I was drowned, washed up and left for dead, yes, sure was <eos> I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, ooh <eos> I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes, I did <eos> I was crowned with a spike right in through my head, oh yeah <eos> But it's all, it's alright, oh, and that is a gas <eos> I said, it's all, alright <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gas, yes, it is <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Jump, jump, jump) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Jump, jump, jump) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Jump, will you jump?) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Oh, (Incomprehensible) me) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Real gas) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Girl, yes I was) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (I was schooled with a strap right across my back) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Oh, yeah) <eos> (I frowned at a crust of bread, yeah) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas <eos> (I was crowned with a spike runnin' through my head, yeah) <eos> Hallelujah <eos> 
Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul <eos> He said I'm there before my time <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> I'm running out of reasons to start up a conversation with you <eos> Usually, I'd be the first to run to your defense <eos> But this time, I can't even come up with an excuse <eos> Tengo que vivir un día a la vez, poco a poco <eos> Otherwise, I'd lose my head <eos> And I'd start doubting everything that I believe in <eos> Believe me (No, no, no, no) <eos> Tengo miedo de estar sola <eos> I need to get my act together, I know <eos> I say I'm better on my own, but <eos> He's telling me I need to grow up, let go <eos> I tell him that I've got an old soul (Old soul) <eos> He said I'm there before my time (Time) <eos> I'm asking what all of the rush is for <eos> But I don't wanna wait in line <eos> (Good things take time) <eos> You push me to a side, why do I wait <eos> For you to come around and talk again? <eos> Mess with my mind, I'll move myself out of your way <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> I'd just rather not confront them because then they bring us problems <eos> And they're always in the back of my head <eos> Are you bored yet? Are you leaving? <eos> It's kinda shifted, I feel the difference <eos> Don't want attachment to you, no <eos> I only say I don't do feelings 'cause you're not ready to hear them <eos> And I'm not ready to feel 'em just yet <eos> Just yet, mm <eos> 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> Take a look at the five and ten <eos> It's glistening once again <eos> With candy canes and silver lanes aglow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots <eos> Is the wish of Barney and Ben; <eos> Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk <eos> Is the hope of Janice and Jen; <eos> And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Everywhere you go; <eos> There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well <eos> It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; <eos> Soon the bells will start <eos> And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing <eos> Right within your heart <eos> It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas <eos> Toys in every store <eos> But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be <eos> On your own front door <eos> Sure it's Christmas once more <eos> 
This hurt that I'm holding's gettin' heavy <eos> But I'ma keep a smile on my shoulders 'til I'm sweaty <eos> Beggin' on my knees <eos> Screamin', "Someone come and help me" <eos> But by the time they're there <eos> I've already hid the body <eos> My breath's gettin' short and I'm unsteady <eos> Wellin' up in tears as I lay upon your belly <eos> Telling you, "I'm fine, I don't really need nobody" <eos> But you say through a sigh <eos> That I said that lie already <eos> I just needed company now <eos> Yeah, I just needed someone around <eos> Yeah, I don't care what song that we play <eos> Or mess that we make <eos> Just company now <eos> Comfort crowd <eos> Comfort crowd <eos> We rot, thinkin' lots about nothing <eos> Yeah, I could spend a lifetime <eos> Sitting here talkin' <eos> And even if I cry all over your body <eos> You don't really mind <eos> Say you like your shirt soggy <eos> Yeah, I just needed company now <eos> Yeah, I just needed someone around <eos> Yeah, I don't care what song that we play <eos> Or mess that we make <eos> Just company now <eos> Comfort crowd <eos> Comfort crowd <eos> We mess around <eos> And laugh too loud <eos> And make the sounds <eos> We try to hide when people are around <eos> By blood we're bound <eos> Through ups and downs <eos> Through smiles and pouts <eos> Comfort crowd <eos> You can always count <eos> Yeah, I just needed company now <eos> Yeah, I just needed someone around <eos> Yeah, I don't care what song that we play <eos> Or mess that we make <eos> Just company now <eos> Comfort crowd <eos>

Everybody's goin' out tonight <eos> But I got somethin' else on my mind <eos> And a long list of reasons why <eos> We're better off stayin' in <eos> I've been missin' you all week <eos> A little one on one, that's what I need <eos> A little me and you party <eos> Yeah, we're better off if we <eos> Put the lock on the door <eos> Drop the needle on the record <eos> Kick your shoes on the floor <eos> Turn this night on to eleven <eos> But those thoughts in your head <eos> And those pillows on your bed <eos> And that dress, these lights <eos> They're all better off <eos> They're all better off <eos> I love that lipstick on your lips <eos> But if it fades with every kiss then <eos> Let me tell it like it is <eos> It's better off, better off <eos> Put the lock on the door <eos> Drop the needle on the record <eos> Kick your shoes on the floor <eos> Turn this night on to eleven <eos> But those thoughts in your head <eos> And those pillows on your bed <eos> And that dress, these lights <eos> They're all better off <eos> Yeah, better off <eos> Everybody's goin' out tonight <eos> But I've got somethin' else on my mind <eos> Put the lock on the door <eos> Drop the needle on the record <eos> Kick your shoes on the floor <eos> Turn this night on to eleven <eos> But those thoughts in your head <eos> And those pillows on your bed <eos> And that dress, these lights <eos> They're all better off <eos> They're all better off <eos> Yeah, that dress, these lights <eos> They're all better off <eos> 
What's the furthest place from here? <eos> It hasn't been my day for a couple years <eos> What's a couple more? <eos> And if I go, don't forget the one good thing I almost did <eos> I learned your name without words <eos> I used my eyes, not my hands <eos> What's the closest you can come to an almost total wreck <eos> And still walk away, all limbs intact? <eos> And when I go, you'll be there <eos> Crying out, begging me <eos> I won't hear <eos> I'll just go fast into this night on broken legs <eos> A near miss or a close call? <eos> I keep a room at the hospital <eos> I scratch my accidents into the wall <eos> I couldn't wait to breathe your breath <eos> I cut in line, I bled to death <eos> I got to you, there was nothing left <eos> What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love <eos> And still smile to your new found friends? <eos> In the same confusing breath <eos> You pull away and draw me in <eos> I wanted you, you wanted more <eos> I built this life and now it's mine <eos> A near miss or a close call? <eos> I keep a room at the hospital <eos> I scratch my accidents into the wall <eos> I couldn't wait to breathe your breath <eos> I cut in line, I bled to death <eos> I got to you, there was nothing left <eos> A near miss or a close call? <eos> I keep a room at the hospital <eos> I scratch my accidents into the wall <eos> I couldn't wait to breathe your breath <eos> I cut in line, I bled to death <eos> I got to you, there was nothing left <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Baby, baby <eos> You don't understand <eos> How much I love you baby <eos> And how much I wanna be your only man, oh baby <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> You don't have to go <eos> Stay a little while longer baby <eos> I wanna talk to you just a little more <eos> I see the little tears in your eyes about to fall <eos> You are wondering if I'm for real <eos> But if you cry, I wonder why you cry <eos> I tell you, know why this is how I feel <eos> Baby I'm for real <eos> (Baby I'm for real) <eos> (Baby I'm for real) <eos> But if you wanna know the truth about it <eos> Girl, I just can't live with out you <eos> And that's why I'm confessing my love to you <eos> So that I can live my whole life with you <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> (My whole life with you) <eos> Don't leave <eos> (My whole life with you) <eos> Never, never, never, never gonna leave you baby <eos> (My whole life with you) <eos> Oh <eos> (My whole life with you) <eos> 
Well I went down to the Grundy County Auction <eos> Where I saw something I just had to have <eos> My mind told me I should proceed with caution <eos> But my heart said go ahead and make a bid on that <eos> And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign <eos> I'd give anything to make you mine all mine <eos> I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call <eos> Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine <eos> Man I gotta have her she's a one of a kind <eos> I'm goin' once, goin' twice <eos> I'm sold on the lady in the second row <eos> She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know <eos> She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes <eos> And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye <eos> Well the auctioneer was goin' 'bout a mile a minute <eos> He was takin' bids and callin' them out loud <eos> And I guess I was really gettin' in it <eos> Cause I just shouted out above the crowd <eos> And I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign <eos> I'd give anything to make you mine all mine <eos> I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call <eos> Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine <eos> Man I gotta have her, she's a one of a kind <eos> I'm goin' once, goin' twice <eos> I'm sold on the lady in the long black dress <eos> Well she won my heart it was no contest <eos> With her ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes <eos> Well I'm about to bid my heart goodbye <eos> Yeah we found love on the auction block <eos> And I hauled her heart away <eos> Now we still love to laugh about <eos> The way we met that day <eos> When I said hey pretty lady won't you gimme a sign <eos> I'd give anything to make you mine all mine <eos> I'll do your biddin' and be at your beck and call <eos> Yeah I've never seen anyone lookin' so fine <eos> Man I gotta have her she's a one of a kind <eos> I'm goin' once, goin' twice <eos> I'm sold on the lady in the second row <eos> She's an eight, she's a nine, she's a ten I know <eos> She's got ruby red lips, blond hair, blue eyes <eos> And I'm about to bid my heart goodbye <eos> 
Y cuando sientas que no puedes más, que no encuentras la salida <eos> No la busques en el mismo bar o en la página amarilla <eos> Cuando el dolor es fuerte no te deja pensar <eos> Siempre habrá una canción que te pueda salvar <eos> En mi Pueblo nadie me entendió, fui un enigma indescifrable <eos> Qué daño causa la estrechez de la gente intolerable <eos> Cuando la mente no comprendе algo, se asusta <eos> Siempre habrá una canción quе te pueda salvar <eos> Sé que nunca fui el más popular en el colegio <eos> Pensé que me querrías aunque no fuera de abolengo, nena <eos> Que me amarías sin pensar en lo demás <eos> Pero me guardaste en una nevera tibia de amistad <eos> Sé que nunca fui el más popular en el colegio <eos> Pensé me querrías aunque no fuera de abolengo como tú <eos> Que me amarías sin pensar en lo demás <eos> Pero me guardaste en una nevera tibia de amistad <eos> 
I promise that I won't fall down <eos> I promise that I won't skin my knee <eos> Like you promised you'd always be around to take good care of me <eos> And I remember you standing behind that white picket fence with a white peaked face <eos> Trying hard to embrace my youth <eos> Before it escapes, before its too late <eos> And clutching the fence she said <eos> 'How have I hurt you, What have I done?' <eos> 'Did I desert you, or spite with my tongue?' <eos> 'Was I too eager, or loved you too much?' <eos> I love you too much <eos> Now that I'm all grown. I'm feeling so alone <eos> Why have you brought me here? <eos> Now that I'm all grown. I'm feeling so alone <eos> Why have you brought me here? <eos> You say all these things I say but It's not the same <eos> I'm feeling so alone today but all I know <eos> I'll ice my thoughts I'll ice my mind for now <eos> It's not your fault, You did what you could do <eos> For this I will love you, for always <eos> You hold my heart and my tiny hand <eos> Thank you for all these things <eos>

You raised the lights when it was frightening <eos> Calmed the storm when it was rising <eos> You found me there where I was hiding <eos> All I have is here and now <eos> If the ground beneath our feet is disappearing <eos> I'll be here beside you, always be right near you <eos> Remember me, won't you? <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> When I was reaching out in the dark <eos> When the streets below just looked so far <eos> When I forgot everything that I was <eos> All I needed was your love <eos> If the earth beneath our feet is old and caves in <eos> For a second we are fighting, when it's late in the evening <eos> Don't let me go, dear <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> Take you as you are, as you are <eos> As you are <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise (I promise) <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> I know we've all got our problems <eos> And it's a blessing that we made it here so far (hey) <eos> If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise <eos> I promise to take you, take you as you are <eos> 
I bet you're wondering how I knew <eos> 'Bout your plans to make me blue <eos> With some other guy you knew before <eos> Between the two of us guys <eos> You know I love you more <eos> It took me by surprise, I must say <eos> When I found out yesterday <eos> Don't you know that <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> I know a man ain't supposed to cry <eos> But these tears I can't hold inside <eos> Losing you would end my life you see <eos> Because you mean that much to me <eos> You could have told me yourself <eos> That you love someone else <eos> Instead <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine <eos> Oh, I heard it through the grapevine <eos> And I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> People say "believe half of what you see <eos> Son and none of what you hear" <eos> But I can't help being confused <eos> If it's true please tell me dear: <eos> Do you plan to let me go <eos> For the other guy you loved before? <eos> Don't you know <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> Not much longer would you be mine, baby <eos> I heard it through the grapevine <eos> I'm just about to lose my mind <eos> Honey, honey, yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Honey, Honey, I know (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> That you're letting me go (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Said I heard it through the grapevine (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby) <eos> Oh, heard it thought the grapevine (yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos>

Kkkk... <eos> ¿Sabes por qué pasó y finjo que no te veo? <eos> Porque borrar tu cara es mi mayor deseo <eos> Te estás burlando de mi tolerancia <eos> A ti ya no te queda ni un poquito confianza <eos> Não vem me rotular, não caibo em caixa direito <eos> Me respeita se tu quer respeito <eos> Não vou te mostrar que hoje eu tô avessa <eos> Mas nada me impede de te xingar na minha cabeça <eos> Hoy digo que te vas a tomar por culo <eos> Deja de meterte en mi vida y a <eos> La puta que parió, ¿Donde esto se vió? <eos> Hoy mi paciencia está en cero <eos> Eu quero que tu vá, vá tomar no cu <eos> Para de tomar conta da minha vida e vai <eos> Pra puta que pariu, aonde já se viu? <eos> Hoje eu tô tipo tolerância zero <eos> Não te tolero <eos> You're messing with my head, I see you, it’s so lame <eos> But, baby, I ain't got the time for fucking games <eos> You've got that something I can’t deal with, it's such a shame <eos> I wonder why on earth you thought that we would still be friends <eos> Não vem me rotular, não caibo em caixa direito <eos> Me respeita se tu quer respeito <eos> No voy a demostrar que estoy molesta <eos> Pero nada me impide maldecirte en mi cabeza <eos> Please, can you go to hell? I know your type too well <eos> Fuck off and mind your own damn shitty business <eos> Y a la puta que parió, ¿Donde esto se vió? <eos> Hoy mi paciencia está en cero <eos> Eu quero que tu vá, vá tomar no cu <eos> Para de tomar conta da minha vida e <eos> Please, your shit can't be for real, don't play me now for fool <eos> My lips can't help it, words keep coming, fuck, fuck you <eos> Não te tolero <eos> Haha <eos> Essa porra pega, hein? <eos>

Yeah, I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Pulling away from all my sins <eos> Tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> I don't wanna leave you lonely but I've got to <eos> 'Cause it's only the things I need to prove <eos> To you and everybody else <eos> That scares me so damn much <eos> I can't take it I'm not strong <eos> It's probably best that I move on <eos> Get outta here, fade away <eos> That's why I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> And tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Everybody's gotta die somehow <eos> Why not for me right now, right now <eos> Well, I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Drunk driving again <eos> I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> Tell my mother I lovе her and take care of my friеnds <eos> 'Cause I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Yeah, I'm drunk driving again <eos>

Dime si llegué a tiempo para la rumba <eos> Hoy traigo aquí un cantar para el bembé <eos> Y también traigo un saco de alegría <eos> Para que se inspire todo aquél que no lo esté Que suene el quinto, clave y timbal con la tumbadora <eos> Pues tengo ganas de bailar y echar un pie <eos> Tan sólo quiero que cuando yo cante, bailen <eos> Y que bailen todos con la punta del pie (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Bailalo rico, María, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> No me digas que tú no fuiste a la rumba, si yo te avisé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Con la punta, con la punta, con la punta, con el peroné <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Y si quieres guarachar, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Y vente a la fiesta, mulata, que yo te enseñé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Es que si yo llego a saber que Perico era sordo, yo paro el tren <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Con la punta, con la punta, con la punta suave <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Para que puedas guarachar conmigo, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Dale movimiento a la cintura, como te enseñé <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie <eos> Con la punta del pie (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Es que te busqué por Jesús María y no te encontré <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Bailalo rico, mi gente, con la punta del pie <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Recuérdalo siempre, mulata, con la punta suave <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) <eos> Están tocando la gloria, pa´que baile usted <eos> (Bailen con la punta del pie <eos> Gocen con la punta del pie) (Bailen) <eos>

Si pudiera encontrar las palabras <eos> Para poder decir lo que siento yo <eos> Si pudiera expresar mis sentimientos <eos> Gritaría que te amo <eos> Si pudiera encontrar la forma <eos> De decir que eres todo para mi <eos> Si pudiera revelarte que <eos> Contigo he descubierto <eos> El amor <eos> Si pudiera <eos> Gritaría que te amo <eos> Que te has vuelto una obsesión <eos> Y que siempre estas presente <eos> Y vives en mi corazón <eos> Gritaría que te extraño <eos> Que he perdido la razón <eos> Que imagino tus caricias <eos> Que estoy loco por tu amor <eos> Gritaría <eos> Que te amo <eos> Si pudiera encontrar las palabras <eos> Para poder decir lo que siento yo <eos> Si pudiera expresar mis sentimientos <eos> Gritaría que te amo <eos> Si pudiera encontrar la forma <eos> De decir que eres todo para mi <eos> Si pudiera revelarte que <eos> Contigo he descubierto <eos> El amor <eos> Si pudiera <eos> Gritaría que te amo <eos> Que te has vuelto una obsesión <eos> Y que siempre estas presente <eos> Y vives en mi corazón <eos> Gritaría que te extraño <eos> Que he perdido la razón <eos> Que imagino tus caricias <eos> Que estoy loco por tu amor <eos> Gritaría que te amo <eos> Que yo muero por tu amor <eos> Y que ya no soy el mismo <eos> Llevo dentro una ilusión <eos> Gritaría <eos> Que te amo <eos> 
I go out walking after midnight <eos> Out in the moonlight just like we used to do <eos> I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you <eos> I walk for miles along the highway <eos> Well, that's just my way of saying, I love you <eos> I'm always walking after midnight, searching for you <eos> I stopped to see a weeping willow <eos> Crying on his pillow <eos> Maybe he's crying for me <eos> And as the skies turn gloomy <eos> Night winds whisper to me <eos> I'm lonesome as I can be <eos> I go out walking after midnight <eos> Out in the starlight <eos> Just hoping you may be somewhere walking <eos> After midnight searching for me <eos> I stopped to see a weeping willow <eos> Crying on his pillow <eos> Maybe he's crying for me <eos> And as the skies turn gloomy <eos> Night winds whisper to me <eos> I'm lonesome as I can be <eos> I'm out walking after midnight, out in the starlight <eos> Just hoping maybe you're somewhere <eos> Walking after midnight, searching for me <eos> 
Back in black, I hit the sack <eos> I've been too long, I'm glad to be back <eos> Yes, I'm let loose from the noose <eos> That's kept me hanging about <eos> I'm just looking at the sky 'cause it's getting me high <eos> Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die <eos> I got nine lives, cat's eyes <eos> Abusing every one of them and running wild <eos> 'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> Back in the back of a Cadillac <eos> Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack <eos> Yes, I'm in a bang with a gang <eos> They've got to catch me if they want me to hang <eos> 'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack <eos> Nobody's gonna get me on another rap <eos> So, look at me now, I'm just making my play <eos> Don't try to push your luck, just get out of my way <eos> 'Cause I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, yes I'm back <eos> Well, I'm back, back <eos> Well, I'm back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black, yow <eos> Ah, yeah <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Take my love <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> Yeah <eos> Ah, hey yeah <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Well, I'm back (I'm back) <eos> Back, well I'm (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back (I'm back) <eos> Back, back in black <eos> Yes, I'm back in black <eos> I've hit the sack <eos>

It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart <eos> But to movin' on is the hardest part <eos> It comes in waves, the letting go <eos> But the memory fades, everybody knows <eos> Everybody knows <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Maybe months go by, maybe years from now <eos> And I meet someone and it's workin' out <eos> Every now and then, he can see right through <eos> 'Cause when I look at him <eos> Yeah, all I  see is you <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> What if I never get over? <eos> What if I never get closure? <eos> What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya? <eos> What if It never gets better? <eos> What if this lasts forever and ever and ever? <eos> I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got? <eos> What if your love was my one and only shot? <eos> What if I end up with nothing to compare it to <eos> What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Oh, what if I never get over? <eos> Over you <eos>

You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos> 
Well it rained again this Christmas <eos> Seems to happen every year <eos> And it only snows on TV <eos> And I saw you in your photographs <eos> Seems you're having so much fun <eos> And it's okay, you don't belong to me <eos> How I hate this time of year <eos> It's dark and it's cold <eos> And I feel I'm getting older <eos> And I wonder... <eos> Are you watching Home Alone, too? <eos> Are you watching Home Alone 2, too? <eos> I'm dreaming of you <eos> And I don't know what to do <eos> Well I saw you last Christmas eve <eos> When I've ruined everything <eos> How strange – from lovers to friends <eos> And I heard you on the radio <eos> And you played our favourite song <eos> It's okay, I know how it ends <eos> And I hate this time of year <eos> It's dark and it's shit <eos> And I feel I'm getting older <eos> Still I wonder... <eos> Are you watching Home Alone, too? <eos> Are you watching Home Alone, too? <eos> As I'm dreaming of you <eos> I will change, I promise to be <eos> Better, so much better than before <eos> I will be good <eos> And I'll change when I want to <eos> Are you watching Home Alone, too? <eos> Are you watching Home Alone, too? <eos>

Well I had to come back wet, for you to believe <eos> Some rain was falling on the garden <eos> And I had to get reborn before I could leave <eos> In case I'm wrong, I beg your pardon <eos> All the days and the years keeping on to achieving <eos> Things you started destroying <eos> You were testing strength I could not give <eos> To see you getting down <eos> The thoughts that bring up disappointment <eos> When is the day that I will die for you? <eos> And well, it's easy to understand if you want to leave <eos> I know how fine it's in your tower <eos> It's a picture of some land you tried to achieve <eos> And in case I'm wrong, I beg your pardon <eos> All those days and the years keeping on to achieving <eos> Things you started destroying <eos> You were testing strength I could not give <eos> To see you getting down <eos> The thoughts bring up disappointment <eos> When is the day that I will die for you? <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> Oh, woo <eos> I had to come back wet <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to come back wet) <eos> I had to come back wet (I had to) <eos> 
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true <eos> Or is he holding you the way I do? <eos> Though love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know <eos> Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go? <eos> You can't say the words I want to hear <eos> While you're with another man <eos> Do you want me, answer yes or no <eos> Darling, I will understand <eos> Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone <eos> Let's pretend that we're together, all alone <eos> I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low <eos> And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go <eos> 
Just a small-town girl <eos> Livin' in a lonely world <eos> She took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> Just a city boy <eos> Born and raised in South Detroit <eos> He took the midnight train goin' anywhere <eos> A singer in a smoky room <eos> The smell of wine and cheap perfume <eos> For a smile, they can share the night <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Workin' hard to get my fill <eos> Everybody wants a thrill <eos> Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time <eos> Some will win, some will lose <eos> Some are born to sing the blues <eos> Oh, the movie never ends <eos> It goes on and on and on and on <eos> Strangers waitin' <eos> Up and down the boulevard <eos> Their shadows searchin' in the night <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Livin' just to find emotion <eos> Hidin' somewhere in the night <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on <eos> Streetlight people <eos> Don't stop believin' <eos> Hold on to that feeling <eos> Streetlight people <eos> 
Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And the cares that hung around me through the week <eos> Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak <eos> When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to climb a mountain <eos> And reach the highest peak <eos> But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to go out fishing <eos> In a river or a creek <eos> But I don't enjoy it half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Now Mamma Dance with me <eos> I want my arm(s) about you <eos> That (Those) charm(s) about you <eos> Will carry me through... <eos> (Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging) <eos> Out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos> 
The lies, the weight <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> The lies, the weight <eos> It's clear I lost my way <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> Decomposing <eos> I thought I was an architect, but I was just moving dirt <eos> Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> Boring the barriers that kept others away <eos> The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall <eos> So now I know there is no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my lies <eos> Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great <eos> Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape <eos> Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my pride crushing me <eos> Beneath my lies collapsing <eos> But we are still alive <eos> We are still alive <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> My own grave <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive, buried alive <eos> Finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> What I'd become in my own grave <eos> Buried in my own grave alive <eos> 
At a certain speed on the interstate <eos> Everything looks the same <eos> The blurry green helps me meditate <eos> When everything's always changing <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I took a ride down the boulеvard <eos> To see where we usеd to hang <eos> It's worn down like the rest of us <eos> But that's a quick coat o' paint <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> My mind's racing <eos> Yeah, I just need some four-wheel isolation <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I can't afford that vacation <eos> And you can't see the skyline from the basement <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need (We got everything we need) <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me (You know you got me) <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need, yeah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 
Lolita, how could they do this to you? <eos> I'd hear your cries of the night <eos> With you  it's true <eos> Siento tus lagrimas de dolor <eos> No te olvides de tu color <eos> Pasa la gente indiferente <eos> Nunca se me olvida de quererte <eos> El espejo que te duele el diablo <eos> No te dejó ver todo tan claro <eos> Imprisoned by your own mind <eos> I promise, light, I'll treat you kind <eos> Lolita, I would be nothing without you <eos> I'll change the color of your endless blue <eos> Lolita, how could I go on without you? <eos> I'll give you evеrything they failed to do <eos> Siento tus lagrimas dе dolor <eos> Nunca me olvido de tu color <eos> Pasa la gente indiferente <eos> Nunca se me olvida de quererte <eos> El espejo que te duele el diablo <eos> No te dejó ver todo tan claro <eos> Pasa la gente indiferente <eos> Nunca se me olvida de quererte <eos> El espejo que te duele el diablo <eos> No te dejó ver todo tan claro <eos> Imprisoned by your own mind <eos> I promise, light, I'll treat you kind <eos> 
There's a land that I have heard about <eos> So far across the sea (repeat) <eos> To have you all, my dreamland <eos> Would be like heaven to me (repeat) <eos> We'll get our breakfast from the tree <eos> We'll get our honey from the bees <eos> We'll take a ride on the waterfalls <eos> And all the glories, we'll have them all <eos> And we'll live together on that dreamland <eos> And have so much fun (repeat) <eos> Oh, what a time that will be <eos> Oh yes, we'll wait, wait, wait and see <eos> We'll count the stars up in the sky... <eos> ...And surely we'll never die <eos> 
Brainstorm, take me away from the norm <eos> I got to tell you somethin' <eos> This phenomenon, I had to put it in a song <eos> And it goes like <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> You wanna know what brings me here, oh <eos> You glide through my head, blind to fear <eos> And I know why <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> You live too far away <eos> Your voice rings like a bell anyway <eos> Don't give up your independence <eos> Unless it feels so right <eos> Nothing good comes easily <eos> Sometimes you've got to fight <eos> Whoa, amber is the color of your energy <eos> Whoa, shades of gold displayed naturally <eos> Launched a thousand ships in my heart, so easy <eos> Still, it's fine from afar <eos> And you know that <eos> Whoa, brainstorm, take me away from the norm <eos> Whoa, I got to tell you somethin' <eos> 
Loro non sanno di che parlo <eos> Vestiti sporchi, fra', di fango <eos> Giallo di siga' fra le dita <eos> Io con la siga' camminando <eos> Scusami, ma ci credo tanto <eos> Che posso fare questo salto <eos> E anche se la strada è in salita <eos> Per questo ora mi sto allenando <eos> E buonasera, signore e signori <eos> Fuori gli attori <eos> Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni <eos> Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni <eos> Qui la gente è strana tipo spacciatori <eos> Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori <eos> Mo li prendo a calci 'sti portoni <eos> Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori <eos> Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Io ho scritto pagine e pagine <eos> Ho visto sale, poi lacrime <eos> Questi uomini in macchina <eos> Non scalare le rapide <eos> Scritto sopra una lapide <eos> In casa mia non c'è Dio <eos> Ma se trovi il senso del tempo <eos> Risalirai dal tuo oblio <eos> E non c'è vento che fermi <eos> La naturale potenza <eos> Dal punto giusto di vista <eos> Del vento senti l'ebrezza <eos> Con ali in cera alla schiena <eos> Ricercherò quell'altezza <eos> Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta <eos> Prova a tagliarmi la testa <eos> Perché <eos> Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cosa parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Parla la gente purtroppo <eos> Parla, non sa di che cazzo parla <eos> Tu portami dove sto a galla <eos> Che qui mi manca l'aria <eos> Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro <eos> E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro <eos> Noi siamo diversi da loro <eos> 
Si por cosas del destino <eos> Un día tú y yo nos despedimos <eos> Ay, yo no sé qué comería <eos> O de qué me reiría <eos> Porque el mundo sin ti no me lo imagino <eos> Si por cosas de la vida <eos> Llega el hombre que por fin te merecías <eos> Y si él es tu alma gemela <eos> Yo me quito aunque me duela <eos> Y hasta dos o tres consejos le daría <eos> No te preocupes por mí <eos> Yo me las arreglaría <eos> Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía <eos> Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti <eos> Y aunque te den el doble de caricias <eos> Y el triple de los besos que te di <eos> Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día <eos> Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti <eos> Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero <eos> Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos> No te preocupes por mí <eos> Yo me las arreglaría <eos> Pa' cambiarme de cabeza pa' otra que no sea la mía <eos> Y no pensar en ti, ya no pensar en ti <eos> Y aunque te den el doble de caricias <eos> Y el triple de los besos que te di <eos> Y aunque te den 21 rosas al día <eos> Y mil veces digan que mueren por ti <eos> Ay, si te dan todo eso me quito el sombrero <eos> Pero nadie va a quererte la mitad <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos> De lo que yo a ti te quiero <eos>

It's a mystery to me <eos> We have a greed, with which we have agreed <eos> You think you have to want more than you need <eos> Until you have it all, you won't be free <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> When you want more than you have, you think you need <eos> And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed <eos> I think I need to find a bigger place <eos> 'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> There's those thinking more or less less is more <eos> But if less is more how you keeping score? <eos> Means for every point you make your level drops <eos> Kinda like you're starting from the top <eos> And you can't do that <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, have mercy on me <eos> I hope you're not angry if I disagree <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely, without me <eos>

Yeah <eos> I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze <eos> I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway <eos> Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase <eos> I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah <eos> I battle with depression, but the question still remains <eos> Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage? <eos> And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase <eos> Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day <eos> And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze <eos> Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace <eos> I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace <eos> How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case? <eos> Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste <eos> Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take <eos> But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage <eos> Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention <eos> I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing <eos> And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine <eos> Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave <eos> I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again <eos> Crashed my car just to feel again <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah <eos> Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh <eos> We're sick and tired of wondering <eos> Praying to a god that you don't believe <eos> You're searching for the truth in the lost and found <eos> So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now? <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos>

It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear <eos> She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair <eos> And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight" <eos> We go to a party and everyone turns to see <eos> This beautiful lady that's walking around with me <eos> And then she asks me "Do you feel all right?" <eos> And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight" <eos> I feel wonderful because I see <eos> The love light in your eyes <eos> And the wonder of it all <eos> Is that you just don't realize how much I love you <eos> It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head <eos> So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed <eos> And then I tell her, as I turn out the light <eos> I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight <eos> Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight" <eos>

Every second counts <eos> I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and <eos> All these little games <eos> You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah <eos> Every minute counts <eos> I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah <eos> Can you figure me out? <eos> Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch <eos> Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time <eos> I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine <eos> Can you see me using everything to hold back? <eos> I guess this could be worse <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Pour your glass of wine <eos> Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah) <eos> Cases under the bed <eos> Spill it open, let it rush to my head <eos> I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners <eos> Savor this with everything I have inside of me <eos> I'm not the type to run <eos> I know that we're having fun <eos> But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed <eos> Tell you how I felt <eos> Sugar coated melting in your mouth <eos> Pardon my emotions <eos> I should probably keep it all to myself <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Can you see me?

I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> Baby I can see you drinking too much <eos> Tipsy 'cause you're sipping on your gold Dutch <eos> Some call it rough <eos> But I just call it low touch <eos> Compliment you as our toes touch <eos> In our Reebok <eos> Heart fermenting as I rolled up <eos> Your knee socks <eos> Your tear drops collect <eos> On the tear of your red top <eos> Love so deep had me hitting bedrock <eos> The lead stops until I get my head on <eos> Liquid love on the rocks <eos> Cuppa tea with some scotch <eos> Describe your day in your socks <eos> I’m addicted to you <eos> A victim of my own plot <eos> Depict a life I forgot <eos> Im sick of writing my wrongs <eos> Illicit love is enough <eos> Drink what is left in my cup <eos> Symbolises when to give up <eos> Somewhere in that is a lesson you can pick up <eos> I’m sick of being such sucker for a kiss of your lips <eos> Tonic and gin <eos> The saga begins <eos> I wanna pretend <eos> Condemned for my sins <eos> Flipping predicaments <eos> Sniffing and cigarettes <eos> Kissing through a silhouette <eos> You’ll soon forget <eos> The moon reflects <eos> The man you used to know <eos> Charmed her by her arm and wit <eos> A rapid growth <eos> A midnight hope <eos> A dip dyed choker <eos> She sips I smoke <eos> Lips I provoke <eos> We risk our moments <eos> Below our noses <eos> Trickle of roses and a pocket full of poems <eos> Baby drinking too much but I guess she knows <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> I've been staring at you for a while <eos> Smoking that smoke over there with a smile <eos> I don't know what it is but you've got me in the zone <eos> I don't really wanna get to know you <eos> But we can still have fun yeah <eos> Just us two <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> Baby I can see you drinking too much <eos> (Lately I can see you acting fooling) <eos> Blatant when you're taking aims at Cupid <eos> (But daisies don’t define your lady's tulips) <eos> 
Eyes like the pools of the Frio River where it ripples over smooth grey stones <eos> Hair that shone like your Palomino silhouetted when the fields turn gold <eos> And you show me shades of beauty I had missed <eos> When I come here I always see you like this <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Well the stars burn bright on a moonless night black watеr goes slippin' past the bridge <eos> Smеll the rain roll in on a cool west wind hear the coyotes yippin' on the ridge <eos> And I think it might be time to sell this place <eos> And go somewhere where I might forget your face <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> If I had the chance to see how much you've changed <eos> Would your hair blow free when you lift your eyes? <eos> Would they be the same? <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos> Frio River blue, Palomino gold <eos> Crossin' my mind like these white rock roads <eos> Mem'ries of a love too I'll behold <eos> Frio River blue <eos> Palomino gold <eos>

Olvídame <eos> Que yo te olvido <eos> Y mírame <eos> Que hoy me despido <eos> Qué piensas hacer <eos> Cuando al amanecer sientas frío <eos> Qué piensas hacer <eos> Cuando con nada llenes el vacío <eos> Y ahora qué piensas hacer <eos> Después de todo el daño <eos> Ardíamos ayer <eos> Hoy somos dos extraños <eos> No te molestes en volver <eos> No es la primera vez que pierdes <eos> Ya no me escribas <eos> Que parece que te muerdes <eos> Amor de viernes <eos> Ya no me culpes <eos> Por cada vez que me veas y lo recuerdes <eos> No me reclames <eos> Si quieres sígueme buscando en ellas <eos> Y no me llames <eos> Se te hizo tarde <eos> Sigue intentando prometerle <eos> Aquello que no puedes darle <eos> Dime qué harás sin mí <eos> Yo sin ti <eos> Qué vas a hacer sin mí <eos> Yo sin ti <eos> X2 <eos> Por todo lo que un día fuimos <eos> Cuando a la cara prometimos <eos> Amor sincero y la verdad <eos> Nunca supimos <eos> Cómo sanar lo destruimos <eos> Nos agotamos de intentarlo <eos> Pero sí que lo jodimos <eos> Contigo no quiero las pases <eos> A tiempo malo buena cara <eos> Fuimos estrellas fugaces <eos> Yo ya no quiero que me abraces <eos> Está canción es pa tu ego y para todos tus disfraces <eos> Qué piensas hacer <eos> Cuando al amanecer sientas frío... <eos> 
This world on fire <eos> Feels like a bad dream <eos> Did the hammer come down? <eos> It feels like a kick in the teeth <eos> All this down on my luck <eos> Has been gettin' me down on my knees <eos> It might have been something I need <eos> 'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin' <eos> Doin' anything to win <eos> Now my grass looks like Augusta <eos> I got around to paintin' that fence <eos> I've been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in <eos> And it seems like where I'm going <eos> Might be better than where I been <eos> 'Cause with all this goin' on <eos> I found the right in all this wrong and I finally see <eos> The good Lord knows better than me <eos> I got a little less in the bank <eos> But I get a little more sleep <eos> I get a little more use <eos> Out of that old porch swing <eos> I got a little more her <eos> Holdin' on to a little more me <eos> I feel a little more free <eos> 'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin' <eos> Doin' anything to win <eos> Now my grass looks like Augusta <eos> I got around to paintin' that fence <eos> I've been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in <eos> And it seems like where I'm going <eos> Might be better than where I been <eos> 'Cause with all this goin' on <eos> I found the right in all this wrong and I finally see <eos> The good Lord knows better than me <eos> Knows better than me <eos> If the world does end <eos> I'll take the last day slow <eos> And if He does come back <eos> I know where I'll go <eos> And if He takes His time <eos> Well, I've learned one thing <eos> The good Lord knows better than me <eos> 'Cause I've been chasin, rat racin' <eos> Doin' anything to win <eos> I've made more time for fishin' <eos> I got my old truck runnin' again <eos> I went home to see my mama, been good hearing from old friends <eos> And it seems like where I'm going <eos> Might be better than where I been <eos> 'Cause with all this goin' on <eos> I found the writin' on the wall and I finally see <eos> The good Lord knows better than me <eos> Better than me <eos> So much better than me <eos> 
Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Feeling Christmas all around <eos> And I'm trying to play it cool <eos> But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room <eos> "Let It Snow" is blasting out <eos> But I won't get in the mood <eos> I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's <eos> True love that he thinks of <eos> So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <eos> Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> I've been down this road before <eos> Fell in love on Christmas night <eos> But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side <eos> Now I need someone to hold <eos> Be my fire in the cold <eos> But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's <eos> True love that he thinks of <eos> So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <eos> Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh <eos> On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh <eos> But I don't want a new broken heart <eos> This year I've got to be smart <eos> Oh, baby <eos> (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <eos> If he will be, if he will be here <eos> (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <eos> Oh, woah <eos> Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care) <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy) <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby) <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here) <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?) <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos>

Intéressé(e) par l'explication des paroles de cette chanson ou d'autres ? Venez faire l'analyse des textes avec nous ! <eos> Y a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans <eos> Y veut t'piquer ta pelle et ton seau <eos> Ta couche-culotte avec les bombecs dedans <eos> Lolita défends-toi, fous-y un coup d'rateau dans l'dos <eos> Attends un peu avant d'te faire emmerder <eos> Par ces p'tits machos qui pensent qu'à une chose <eos> Jouer au docteur non conventionné <eos> J'y ai joué aussi je sais de quoi j'cause <eos> J'les connais bien les play-boys des bacs à sable <eos> J'draguais leur mère avant d'connaître la tienne <eos> Si tu les écoutes y t'f'ront porter leur cartable <eos> Heureusement qu'j'suis là, que j'te r'garde et que j't'aime <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Comme j'en ai marre de m'faire tatouer des machins <eos> Qui m'font comme une bande dessinée sur la peau <eos> J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés <eos> Un par un, plantés dans le cuir de mon blouson dans l'dos <eos> T'es la seule gonzesse que j'peux t'nir dans mes bras <eos> Sans m'démettre une épaule sans plier sous ton poids <eos> Tu pèses moins lourd qu'un moineau qui mange pas <eos> Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas <eos> Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes <eos> Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat <eos> Tu risques d'donner faim à un tas de p'tits mecs <eos> Quand t'iras à l'école si jamais t'y vas <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Qu'est-ce tu m'racontes ? Tu veux un petit frangin ? <eos> Tu veux qu'j't'achète un ami Pierrot ? <eos> Eh ! Les bébés ça s'trouve pas dans les magasins et j'crois pas <eos> Que ta mère voudra qu'j'lui fasse un p'tit dans l'dos <eos> Ben quoi Lola on est pas bien ensemble ? <eos> Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux ? <eos> T'entends pas ce bruit c'est le monde qui tremble <eos> Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux <eos> Allez viens avec moi j't'embarque dans ma galère <eos> Dans mon arche y'a d'la place pour tous les marmots <eos> Avant qu'ce monde devienne un grand cimetière <eos> Faut profiter un peu du vent qu'on a dans l'dos <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> 
Someday at Christmas <eos> Men won't be boys <eos> Playing with balms like kids play with toys <eos> One warm December <eos> Our hearts will see <eos> A world where men are free <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no wars <eos> When we have learned <eos> What Christmas is for <eos> When we have found <eos> What life's really worth <eos> They'll be peace on Earth <eos> Someday all are dreams will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> We'll see a land <eos> With no hungry children <eos> And no empty hands <eos> One happy morning <eos> Where people will share <eos> A world where people care <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no tears <eos> All men are equal <eos> And no men have no fears <eos> One shinning moment <eos> One prayer away from our world today <eos> Well someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Oh someday at Christmas <eos> Men will not fail <eos> Hate will be gone and love will prevail <eos> Someday a new world we can start <eos> With hope in every heart <eos> Someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where all men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time oh <eos> But someday oh at Christmas time woo <eos>

You could open with your failings <eos> Make them understand, show the love notes <eos> Make them picture with their eyes closed <eos> Make them wonder where the time goes <eos> Keep your distance south of river <eos> Draw a line, they are not together <eos> Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red <eos> Make me wonder where the time went <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> Be not a stranger land here <eos> I will leave this empty-handed <eos> Feeling selfish, common as shit <eos> Leave me question where your heart lends <eos> How you open-wounded withstand <eos> Lead me into some false pretence <eos> I will ruin you in a second <eos> Leave it up to interpretation <eos> Open-ended invitation <eos> And your wedding, I could crash it <eos> Whisper in your ear “God, I missed you <eos> It's been too much, I can’t stand it” <eos> Then I cried there in the staff room <eos> Selling my seats to your concert <eos> I won't stomach it if I see you <eos> Walking so tall, I can't reach you <eos> Happier, pretty picture <eos> With some new pretty little blue <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> 
Oh little town of Bethlehem <eos> How still we see thee lie <eos> Above thy deep and dreamless sleep <eos> The silent stars go by <eos> Yet in they dark streets shineth <eos> The everlasting light <eos> The hopes and fears of all the years <eos> Are met in thee tonight <eos> For Christ is born of Mary <eos> And gathered all above <eos> While mortals sleep, the angels keep <eos> Their watch of wondering love <eos> Oh morning stars together <eos> Proclaim the holy birth <eos> And praises sing to God the King <eos> And peace to men on Earth <eos> How silently, how silently <eos> The wondrous gift is given <eos> So God imparts to human hearts <eos> The blessings of His heaven <eos> No ear may hear His coming <eos> But in this world of sin <eos> Where meek souls will receive Him still <eos> The dear Christ enters in <eos> Oh holy child of Bethlehem <eos> Descend to us we pray <eos> Cast out our sin and enter in <eos> Be born in us today <eos> We hear the Christmas angels <eos> The great glad tidings tell <eos> Oh come to us, abide with us <eos> Our Lord Emanuel <eos>

Oh, well, imagine <eos> As I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor <eos> And I can't help but to hear <eos> No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words <eos> "What a beautiful wedding! <eos> What a beautiful wedding!”, says a bridesmaid to a waiter <eos> "And yes, but what a shame, what a shame <eos> The poor groom's bride is a whore" <eos> I chime in with a, "Haven't you people ever heard of <eos> Closing the goddamn door?!" <eos> No, it's much better to face these kinds of things <eos> With a sense of poise and rationality <eos> I chime in, "Haven't you people ever heard of <eos> Closing the goddamn door?!" <eos> No, it's much better to face these kinds of things <eos> With a sense of <eos> Oh, well, in fact <eos> Well, I'll look at it this way <eos> I mean, technically our marriage is saved <eos> Well, this calls for a toast, so pour the champagne <eos> Oh!

There are two of us on the run <eos> Going so fast, every doubt we had is coming undone <eos> And falling behind with everything we left there <eos> We held on for far too long <eos> And now we pass so many people on the road <eos> They could come along, I wish they'd been told <eos> They may call it a shot in the dark <eos> From what we know, it's not unheard of <eos> And we'll one day tell our story <eos> Of how we made something of ourselves now <eos> Our favorite parts are what we'll keep <eos> Ornamental parts of love and parts of memories <eos> So everything else has room to grow <eos> 'Cause in better light, everything changes <eos> So we can one day tell our story <eos> Of how we made something of ourselves now <eos> There's no race, there's only a runner <eos> Just keep one foot in front of the other <eos> There's no race, there's only a runner, oh, oh <eos> 1, 2, 3, even when you get tired <eos> Just keep one foot in front of the other <eos> There's no race, no ending in sight <eos> No second too short, no window too tight <eos> So turn off the lights when you leave <eos> 'Cause we've got everything we're gonna need <eos> We're on the run, we're on the run <eos> We're on the run, child <eos> We gotta run, we gotta run <eos> We gotta run, child <eos> One day, tell our story <eos> Of how we made something of ourselves now <eos> One day, tell our story <eos> Of how we made something <eos> We made something of ourselves <eos>

Une nuit je m'endors avec lui <eos> Mais je sais qu'on nous l'interdit <eos> Et je sens la fièvre qui me mord <eos> Sans que j'aie l'ombre d'un remords <eos> Et l'aurore m'apporte le sommeil <eos> Je ne veux pas qu'arrive le soleil <eos> Quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains <eos> Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin <eos> Et je me demande <eos> Si cet amour aura un lendemain <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête <eos> Et je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Oh ! je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Je ressens la pluie d'une autre planète <eos> Quand il me serre tout contre lui <eos> Quand je sens que j'entre dans sa vie <eos> Je prie pour que le destin m'en sorte <eos> Je prie pour que le diable m'emporte <eos> Et l'angoisse me montre son visage <eos> Elle me force à parler son langage <eos> Mais quand je prends sa tête entre mes mains <eos> Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin <eos> Et je me demande <eos> Si cet amour aura un lendemain <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Quand je suis loin de lui <eos> Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tête <eos> Et je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Non je ne suis plus d'ici <eos> Je ressens la pluie d'une autre planète <eos> 
I feel like a bird with broken wings <eos> I can't fly back up in the trees <eos> Or like a addict fiendin' for crack <eos> Tryin' to break the habit, but it keep on comin' back <eos> Or like a child cryin' all night long <eos> Hungry for some food, but it's all gone <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> I feel like I'm lost and can't be found <eos> A boat with a hole that's slowly sinkin' down <eos> Or like a bully that put me to the test <eos> Got me paranoid and I can't get no rest <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> Please Lord, step in <eos> 
Dennis DJ <eos> MC G15 <eos> Para pra pensar se a gente é acidente <eos> Se foi por acaso que o beijo que rolou <eos> Deve ser coisa de Deus na minha frente <eos> Porque, de tantas bocas, a nossa encaixou <eos> (Ô, Senhor, agora, sim!) <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Você nem precisa preocupar <eos> Amores eu vivi, mas todos me levaram a você <eos> Esse tal amor, que eu nunca vi, enfim chegou <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada (Me dá uma sentada) <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Oi, vem) <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o bumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Vai, mozão <eos> Bumbumbumbumbum no chão <eos> Vai, mozão, batendo o... vai, vai, vai <eos> Dennis DJ, sou teu fã! <eos> Só preciso de você, só você <eos> E dando aquela sentada <eos> Seu bumbum me faz querer <eos> Sem querer querendo, te ver pelada (Vai, vai, vai, vai) <eos>

When night time comes <eos> And I'm ten thousand miles away <eos> Just lose yourself <eos> And watch the band kick back and play <eos> Get up keep in line <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> You say, you're feeling fine <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> Get a load off your mind <eos> This place is right it's hard to find <eos> The mood is set alright <eos> It's going to be a long, long night <eos> You keep spinning around <eos> You find it hard to touch the ground <eos> And time is all it takes <eos> You'll find it easy once you make <eos> Get up, keep in line <eos> It's getting tighter all the time <eos> Getting tighter <eos> 
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind <eos> People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time <eos> All day long, I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy <eos> Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify <eos> Can you help me occupy my brain? <eos> Whoa, yeah <eos> I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find <eos> I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind <eos> Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry <eos> Happiness, I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal <eos> And so, as you hear these words telling you now of my state <eos> I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could, but it's too late <eos> 
Putting up defenses 'cause I'm breaking down inside <eos> So I have learn to build these walls and I have learned to hide <eos> But I can't let what feels so wrong turn into what feels right <eos> I'm walking through the darkness, all I feel for real is life <eos> Gimme something to believe in <eos> I need the truth, I cannot lie <eos> Gimme something to believe in <eos> Please don't ask me why <eos> I need something I can breathe in <eos> To lift me up and keep me high <eos> Just give me something to believe in <eos> I need something to believe in, to believe in <eos> You better learn to live, before you learn to fly <eos> We're born with love to give before we open up our eyes <eos> All we need is love and all we've got is time <eos> Deep down somewhere, still I wonder if I can change your mind <eos> Gimme something to believe in <eos> I need the truth, I cannot lie <eos> Gimme something to believe in <eos> Please don't ask me why <eos> I need something I can breathe in <eos> To lift me up and keep me high <eos> Just give me something to believe in <eos> 'Cause I need something to believe in, believe in <eos> Redirecting footsteps, I can see horizon line <eos> I readjust my scope, I pull the trigger, watch it fly <eos> Knowing where you're going's only knowing where you stand <eos> I got my eyes on the horizon, we are never looking back <eos> Gimme something to believe in <eos> I need the truth, I cannot lie <eos> Gimme something to believe in (C'mon) <eos> Please don't ask me why <eos> I need something I can breathe in <eos> To lift me up and keep me high <eos> Just give me something to believe in <eos> 'Cause I need something to believe in, believe in <eos> 
I've never been one to ask for help <eos> If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself <eos> I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday <eos> Quote you the scripture kind <eos> I'm far from a preacher <eos> But I'm a believer <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> For someone to love me like you do <eos> Graceful eyes to see me through <eos> A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me <eos> A touch that kills me too <eos> And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> Every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain <eos> Girl, even today, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> 
La vida es tan cortita <eos> Por eso la disfruto con amigos verdaderos <eos> Vagando por la vida soy un hombre aventurero <eos> Amores pasajeros, la fama y el dinero <eos> Jamás me cambiaran siempre seré el mismo ranchero <eos> Y la vida se acaba <eos> Por eso en la tomada siempre abrazo a los reales <eos> Así me siento agusto son poquitos pero leales <eos> Uno que otro compadre nos cuidamos el hambre <eos> Y aquel que es batalloso se me va chingar su madre <eos> Mi amistad no está en venta yo la doy si la respentan <eos> No hay tiempo pa' rencores <eos> Pero no quiero flores el día de mi despedida <eos> Se que hay muchos amigos que nomás son de a mentiras <eos> El saco a la medida lo bueno se da en vida <eos> Y aunque ya estuve abajo sigo siendo el mismo arriba <eos> Hoy otra borrachera <eos> Mi mesa ya esta llena de amistades verdaderas <eos> Lo que traigo en el alma no lo compra la cartera <eos> Esta noche me gancho con amigos del francho <eos> Y aunque me lo repitan seguire siendo un borracho <eos> Y sigo siendo el mismo, el mismo borracho <eos> Y puro Dos Carnales <eos> Y no se me enrede mi compa <eos> Cuando me piden paro <eos> Con gusto doy mi mano y les comparto lo que tengo <eos> Brindo por ser borracho y ser humilde de amolengo <eos> Siempre me ven sonriedo la vida es un momento <eos> Y aunque me vaya bien jamas lo andamos presumiendo <eos> No hay tiempo pa' rencores <eos> Pero no quiero flores el día de mi despedida <eos> Se que hay muchos amigos que nomás son de a mentiras <eos> El saco a la medida lo bueno se da en vida <eos> Y aunque ya estuve abajo sigo siendo el mismo arriba <eos> Hoy otra borrachera <eos> Mi mesa ya esta llena de amistades verdadera <eos> Lo que traigo en el alma no lo compra la cartera <eos> Esta noche me gancho con amigos del francho <eos> Y aunque me lo repitan seguire siendo un borracho <eos> 
I'm a-gonna raise a fuss <eos> I'm a-gonna raise a holler <eos> About workin' all summer <eos> Just-a trying to earn a dollar <eos> Every time I call my baby <eos> Try to get a date <eos> My boss says "No dice, son <eos> You gotta work late" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos> Well my mama and papa told me <eos> "Son, you gotta make some money <eos> If you wanna use the car <eos> To go a-ridin' next Sunday" <eos> Well, I didn't go to work <eos> Told the boss I was sick <eos> "You can't use the car <eos> Cause you didn't work a lick" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos> I'm gonna take two weeks <eos> Gonna have a fine vacation <eos> I'm gonna take my problem <eos> To the United Nations <eos> Well, I called my congressman <eos> And he said, quote: <eos> "I'd like to help you, son <eos> But you're too young to vote" <eos> Sometimes I wonder <eos> What I'm a-gonna do <eos> But there ain't no cure <eos> For the summertime blues <eos>

At home drawin' pictures of mountain tops <eos> With him on top, lemon yellow sun <eos> Arms raised in a "V" <eos> And the dead lay in pools of maroon below <eos> Daddy didn't give attention <eos> Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Clearly, I remember picking on the boy <eos> Seemed a harmless little fuck <eos> Ooh, but we unleashed a lion <eos> Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast <eos> How could I forget? And he hit me with a surprise left <eos> My jaw left hurting, ooh, dropped wide open <eos> Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard <eos> Daddy didn't give affection, no <eos> And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear <eos> King Jeremy the wicked <eos> Oh, ruled his world <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Try to forget this (Try to forget this) <eos> Try to erase this (Try to erase this) <eos> From the blackboard <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in, spoke in <eos> Jeremy spoke in class today <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in, spoke in, spoke in...) <eos> (Spoke in, spoke in) <eos> Ooh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh <eos> Ooh oh, oh (Spoke in...) <eos> 
I saw Mommy kissin' Santa Claus <eos> Underneath the mistletoe last night <eos> She didn't see me creep <eos> Down the stairs to have a peep <eos> She thought that I was tucked up <eos> In my bedroom, fast asleep <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus <eos> Underneath his beard so snowy white <eos> Oh, what a laugh it would have been <eos> If Daddy had only seen <eos> Mommy kissin' Santa Claus last night <eos> 
I guess I'm going through a phase <eos> I'm feeling kinda low <eos> I never leave the house but I'm not home <eos> Can't tell if I'm awake, or living in a dream <eos> A caterpillar drifting down a stream <eos> And I just wanna fly away <eos> But I can't seem to get my feet up off the ground <eos> Everything is turning upside down <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Going through a chrysalis (Oh yeah) <eos> Don't you ever wonder why, wonder why <eos> We've been going through all this <eos> Maybe there's a cocoon around the world <eos> And we're all dying just to break through <eos> 'Cause we'll be butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> La la la la <eos> My consciousness is just a state of mind <eos> I meditate to metamorphosize <eos> I needed change, I shifted paradigms <eos> Go to Hawaii, get a whole new life <eos> 'Cause I feel the breeze just like a second wind <eos> Underneath my wings and I'm alive again <eos> Seeing everything through a new lens <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Going through a chrysalis (Oh yeah) <eos> Don't you ever wonder why, wonder why <eos> We've been going through all this <eos> Maybe there's a cocoon around the world <eos> And we're all dying just to break through <eos> 'Cause we'll be butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> La la la la la la la <eos> Going through a chrysalis <eos> La la la la la la la <eos> We won't even remember this (oh yeah) <eos> (Oh yeah) <eos> (Oh yeah) <eos> Maybe we're just butterflies, butterflies <eos> Oh, we'll be butterflies <eos> Butterflies, butterflies <eos> Brand new <eos> 
I really can't stay <eos> But baby it's cold outside <eos> I got to go away <eos> But baby it's cold outside <eos> This evening has been <eos> Been hoping that you'd drop in <eos> So very nice <eos> I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice <eos> My mother will start to worry <eos> Beautiful, what's your hurry? <eos> My father will be pacing the floor <eos> Listen to the fireplace roar <eos> So really, I'd better scurry <eos> Beautiful, please don't hurry <eos> But maybe just a half a drink more <eos> I'll put some records on while I pour <eos> The neighbours might think <eos> Baby, it's bad out there <eos> Say, what's in this drink? <eos> No cabs to be had out there <eos> I wish I knew how <eos> Your eyes are like starlight tonight <eos> To break this spell <eos> I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell <eos> I ought to say, no, no, no sir <eos> Oh, mind if I move in closer? <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried <eos> What's the sense in hurting my pride? <eos> I really can't stay <eos> But baby, don't hold out <eos> But baby it's cold outside! <eos> I simply must go <eos> But baby, it's cold outside <eos> The answer is no, no, no <eos> Aw baby, it's cold outside <eos> Your welcome has been <eos> How lucky that you dropped in <eos> So nice and warm <eos> Look out the window at that storm <eos> My sister will be suspicious <eos> Um gosh, your lips are delicious <eos> And my brother will be there at the door <eos> Waves on a tropical shore <eos> My maiden aunt's mind is vicious <eos> Oh gosh, your lips are so delicious <eos> But maybe just a cigarette more <eos> Oh never such a blizzard before <eos> I've got to get home <eos> But baby, you'll freeze out there <eos> Say lend me your coat <eos> Oh up to your knees out there <eos> You've really been grand <eos> I thrill when you touch my hand <eos> But you don't see, no, no <eos> How can you do this thing to me? <eos> There's bound to be talk tomorrow <eos> Think of my life long sorrow <eos> At least there will be plenty implied <eos> If you cought pneumonia and died <eos> But I really can't stay <eos> Get over that whole doubt <eos> But baby it's cold outside! <eos> 
We've been broken down <eos> To the lowest turn <eos> Bein' on the bottom line <eos> Sure ain't no fun <eos> But if we should be evicted <eos> Huh, from our homes <eos> We'll just move somewhere else <eos> And still carry on <eos> Oh <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> Ooooh, aah, baby <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) ooh oooh aah <eos> (Chorus) <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> Aaaaah... <eos> Now we may not know, huh <eos> Where our next meal is coming from <eos> But with you by my side <eos> I'll face what is to come <eos> Aaah <eos> Boy I want to thank you <eos> Yeah, for loving me this way <eos> Things may be a little hard now <eos> But we'll find a brighter day <eos> Oh yeah <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> Ooooh, oooh ooh <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) won't be long <eos> Oh yeah <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> Oooo ooh ooooooooh.... <eos> (spoken) <eos> Talk about the only way is up, baby <eos> Talk about the only way <eos> Talk about the only way is up, baby <eos> Talk about the only way <eos> Talk about the only way is up, baby <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> Hey <eos> (hold on) hold on <eos> (hold on) won't be long <eos> No no no <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now <eos> The only way is up, baby <eos> For you and me now.... <eos>

Joy has dawned upon the world <eos> Promised from creation— <eos> God’s salvation now unfurled <eos> Hope for ev’ry nation <eos> Not with fanfares from above <eos> Not with scenes of glory <eos> But a humble gift of love— <eos> Jesus born of Mary <eos> Sounds of wonder fill the sky <eos> With the songs of angels <eos> As the mighty Prince of Life <eos> Shelters in a stable <eos> Hands that set each star in place <eos> Shaped the earth in darkness <eos> Cling now to a mother’s breast <eos> Vuln’rable and helpless <eos> Shepherds bow before the Lamb <eos> Gazing at the glory; <eos> Gifts of men from distant lands <eos> Prophesy the story <eos> Gold—a King is born today <eos> Incense—God is with us <eos> Myrrh—His death will make a way <eos> And by His blood He’ll win us <eos> Son of Adam, Son of heaven <eos> Given as a ransom; <eos> Reconciling God and man <eos> Christ, our mighty champion! <eos> What a Savior! What a Friend! <eos> What a glorious myst’ry! <eos> Once a babe in Bethlehem <eos> Now the Lord of hist’ry <eos> 
Yo la vi bailar de lejos y soñé despierto <eos> Parecían de otro mundo sus ojitos negros <eos> Quise cantarle en inglés y me salió enredado <eos> Y en su risa descubrí, se me cumplió el milagro <eos> Me dijo: "Ponme un vallenato" <eos> Se me arregló toda la noche <eos> Se fue quitando los zapato' <eos> Y así empezamo' el desorden <eos> Me dijo: "Ponme un vallenato" <eos> Quiero quitarme este despecho <eos> Se fue quitando los zapato' <eos> Y ahora la tengo aquí entre mi pecho <eos> Ay, la tengo <eos> Bailando vallenato apreta'o <eos> La tengo, ay, la tengo <eos> Hablando mi costeño enredado <eos> La tengo <eos> Por ella bailo lo que sea, aunque suene raro <eos> La sigo por el mundo, voy de arriba a abajo <eos> Si con ella me voy, la saco del estadio <eos> Se va a prender la calle si la llevo al barrio <eos> Y pa' qué lo discuto, como tú ninguna <eos> Viendo ese cuerpito me siento en la luna <eos> Cante lo que cante, llena la tribuna <eos> Revienta la pista porque es la má' dura <eos> Ay, la tengo <eos> Bailando vallenato apreta'o <eos> La tengo, ay, la tengo <eos> Hablando mi costeño enredado <eos> La tengo <eos> Me dijo: "Ponme un vallenato" <eos> Quiero quitarme este despecho <eos> Se fue quitando los zapato' <eos> Y ahora la tengo aquí entre mi pecho <eos> Ay, la tengo <eos> Bailando vallenato apreta'o <eos> La tengo, ay, la tengo <eos> Hablando mi costeño enredado <eos> La tengo <eos> Por ella bailo lo que sea, aunque suene raro <eos> La sigo por el mundo, voy de arriba a abajo <eos> Si con ella me voy, la saco del estadio <eos> Se va a prender la calle si la llevo al barrio <eos>

Rising up, back on the street <eos> Did my time, took my chances <eos> Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet <eos> Just a man and his will to survive <eos> So many times it happens too fast <eos> You trade your passion for glory <eos> Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past <eos> You must fight just to keep them alive <eos> It's the eye of the tiger <eos> It's the thrill of the fight <eos> Rising up to the challenge of our rival <eos> And the last known survivor <eos> Stalks his prey in the night <eos> And he's watching us all <eos> With the eye of the tiger <eos> Face to face, out in the heat <eos> Hanging tough, staying hungry <eos> They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <eos> For the kill with the skill to survive <eos> It's the eye of the tiger <eos> It's the thrill of the fight <eos> Rising up to the challenge of our rival <eos> And the last known survivor <eos> Stalks his prey in the night <eos> And he's watching us all <eos> With the eye of the tiger <eos> Rising up, straight to the top <eos> Had the guts, got the glory <eos> Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop <eos> Just a man and his will to survive <eos> It's the eye of the tiger <eos> It's the thrill of the fight <eos> Rising up to the challenge of our rival <eos> And the last known survivor <eos> Stalks his prey in the night <eos> And he's watching us all <eos> With the eye of the tiger <eos> The eye of the tiger <eos> The eye of the tiger <eos> The eye of the tiger <eos> The eye of the tiger <eos> 
Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Gave thee life & bid thee feed <eos> By the stream & o'er the mead; <eos> Gave thee clothing of delight <eos> Softest clothing wooly bright; <eos> Gave thee such a tender voice <eos> Making all the vales rejoice! <eos> Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee! <eos> He is called by thy name <eos> For he calls himself a Lamb: <eos> He is meek & he is mild <eos> He became a little child: <eos> I a child & thou a lamb <eos> We are called by his name <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> 
He intentado casi todo para convencerte, uh <eos> Mientras el mundo se derrumba todo, aquí a mis pies, yeah <eos> Mientras aprendo de esta soledad que desconozco, woah <eos> Me vuelvo a preguntar quizás si sobreviviré <eos> Porque sin ti me queda la conciencia helada y vacía <eos> Porque sin ti me he dado cuenta amor que no renaceré, yeah <eos> Porque he ido más allá del límite de la desolación <eos> Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Ay, yo te juro que <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida (No) <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Qué no dejaría <eos> Y duelen más la' cosa' buena' cuando estás ausente <eos> Yo sé que e' demasiado tarde para remediar <eos> No me queda bien valerme de diez mil excusas <eos> Cuando definitivamente sé que ahora te vas <eos> Y aunque no lo pueda cambiar, yo seguiré esperándote <eos> Por si algún día tú me quiere' ver bien <eos> Aunque te vuelva a repetir que estoy muriendo día a día <eos> Aunque también estés muriendo, tú no me perdonarás <eos> Aunque sin ti haya llegado al límite de la desolación <eos> Y mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Yo sigo muriéndome <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión (Mi religión) <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos (Yeah) <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe, oh <eos> CNCO <eos>

Always when we fight <eos> I try to make you laugh <eos> Til everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> Always when we fight <eos> I kiss you once or twice <eos> And everything's forgotten <eos> I know you hate that <eos> I love you Sunday song <eos> The weeks not yet begun <eos> And everything is quiet <eos> And it's always you and me <eos> Always and forever <eos> You and me always and forever <eos> And it was always <eos> You and me always <eos> You tell me I'm a real man <eos> And try to look impressed <eos> Not very convincing <eos> But you know I love it <eos> Now we watch TV <eos> Til we fall asleep <eos> Not very exciting <eos> But it's you and me <eos> And we'll always be together <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> You and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> It was always you and me, always and forever <eos> 
Well, someone told me yesterday <eos> That when you throw your love away <eos> You act as if you just don't care <eos> You look as if you’re going somewhere <eos> But I just can't convince myself <eos> I couldn't live with no one else <eos> And I can only play that part <eos> And sit and nurse my broken heart <eos> So lonely, lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> Now no one’s knocked upon my door <eos> For a thousand years or more <eos> All made up and nowhere to go <eos> Welcome to this one man show <eos> Just take a seat, they're always free <eos> No surprise, no mystery <eos> In this theatre that I call my soul <eos> I always play the starring role <eos> So lonely, lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> Lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lo– <eos> I feel so lonely <eos> I feel lo-lo-lo– (Lo-lo-lo–) <eos> I feel lo-lo-lonely (I feel lo-lo-lonely) <eos> I feel lo– <eos> I feel lo– <eos> I feel lo– <eos> You know I feel so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> So lonely, so lonely, so lonely <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lo– (So lonely) <eos> I feel so lonely (So lonely) <eos> 
Sitting in my class <eos> Just drifting away <eos> Staring into the windows of the world <eos> Yeah <eos> I can't hear the teacher <eos> His books don't call me at all <eos> I don't see the bad boys trying to catch some play <eos> 'Cause I love your smile <eos> I love your smile <eos> The clock at work says three <eos> And I wanna be free <eos> Free to scream, free to bathe <eos> Free to paint my toes all day, woo! <eos> My boss is lame you know <eos> And so is the pay <eos> I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway <eos> 'Cause I love your smile <eos> Hey, said I love your smile <eos> Time came and showed me your direction <eos> Now I know I'll never ever go back <eos> Taught me that <eos> I can be a better girl <eos> With the love you give <eos> You rock my world <eos> You dig? <eos> I'm showin' the life that I'm living <eos> This is the life that I have and it's given to you <eos> Yeah and it's true <eos> La-dee-da <eos> Twinkly dee <eos> Do you, believe in a girl like me? <eos> Shanice is the one for you to be with <eos> But when I'm caught all alone <eos> I start fessing <eos> It's from a state of depression <eos> And the thunder clouds of doubt move in <eos> I begin to wonder <eos> "Do you still love me?" <eos> But after that <eos> My whole world is beautiful <eos> Blow, Branford, blow <eos> Time came and showed me your direction <eos> Now I know I'll never ever go back <eos> Taught me that <eos> I can be a better girl <eos> With the love you give <eos> You rock my world <eos> Smile, sike <eos> Ooh, I love your smile (smile for me) <eos> Yes I do boy, hee <eos> I love your smile <eos> I love your smile, baby <eos> Heee, heee, heeee, heeeee <eos> I love your smile <eos> I really do (hahahahahaha) <eos> 
Once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it <eos> I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage <eos> I wanna drive this car right over the edge <eos> Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet <eos> I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic <eos> Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic <eos> I never meant to be hypocritical <eos> This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it <eos> I tell myself every night, I could live without it <eos> I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness <eos> But every time I do, I make another mess <eos> And just like that, I know there's no looking back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad) <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos>

Daddies were Daddies and Mamas were saints <eos> What preachers were preaching You could take to the bank <eos> Kids played outside up until it turned dark <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Trucks took a beatin', the working man too <eos> You could turn on the six o' clock and get the whole truth <eos> A seat belt was a backup for Mama's right arm <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we'vе come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when thе world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> Neighbors came by and talked on the porch <eos> We all said goodnight and never locked the front door <eos> Even downtown you could still see the stars <eos> When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could Smoke in a Bar <eos> A deal was a deal when you shook a man's hand <eos> When we saw the flag flying, We all gave a damn <eos> My, oh my, how times have changed <eos> But man sometimes I miss them old days <eos> They say we've come a long way, but I'd say it's a little bit too far <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos> From when the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar <eos>

Estaba pensando las cosas y por más que quiero <eos> Con la conclusión de que tu adrenalina yo soy <eos> Con esos besos salvajes, tu modo tan interesante <eos> Comprimir la realidad, sí me pones a temblar <eos> Tu amor es un mar de tristezas con mis emociones <eos> Y es que estoy tan acostumbrado a ponerme a llorar <eos> Si digo lo que estoy sintiendo, será el armamento perfecto <eos> Para la posibilidad de arrancarme de la faz <eos> Quiero llorar y no puedo <eos> Y mi orgullo tiene miedo <eos> De que se rompa con el tuyo <eos> Para volvernos a amar y empezar <eos> Quiero llorar de tristeza <eos> Y meterme en la cabeza <eos> Que tú y yo seremos la sombra <eos> De un amor que nunca se hará realidad <eos> Tu amor es un mar de tristezas con mis emociones <eos> Y es que estoy tan acostumbrado a ponerme a llorar <eos> Si digo lo que estoy sintiendo, será el armamento perfecto <eos> Para la posibilidad de arrancarme de la faz <eos> Quiero llorar y no puedo <eos> Y mi orgullo tiene miedo <eos> De que se rompa con el tuyo <eos> Para volvernos a amar y empezar <eos> Quiero llorar de tristeza <eos> Y meterme en la cabeza <eos> Que tú y yo seremos la sombra <eos> De un amor que nunca se hará realidad <eos> 
I survived the wasteland of tasting tongues but can't deny <eos> A beacon shined in blistered light for a while <eos> Burning in an open eye <eos> No room for improvement <eos> You're just some muse I use for joy <eos> The version of you I love is some other <eos> Not this virgin little boy <eos> Little souls, blood in bowls and poured on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Thundering loud, I stand up proud as lightning crashed the waves <eos> I don't want to stay, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I pulled you in my body <eos> The thought is really odd I know <eos> Does it alarm you or disarm you? <eos> I should have warned you, I didn't mean to harm you so <eos> I only said I wanted <eos> To bring you near, you flaunted how <eos> You were a loner and a stone <eos> Who didn't know if you could be my home right now <eos> Little signs are beacons shining out on anyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer storm, bodies worn with shimmering lakes <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing your remains <eos> I'll bet your sadness shimmers <eos> I pressed my tongue against your hair <eos> You invite me, you say “delight me, and come inside me” <eos> But there's no room to hide me there <eos> Am I a tortured glutton? <eos> Am I some portion of a whole? <eos> On your horizon, always shining, the beacon brightest <eos> I take my hands off all controls <eos> Little souls can take no more, I'm torn from everyone <eos> It'll never be the same <eos> Summer haze, all decaying, hand around a blade <eos> I don't want to wait, I'm wearing love's remains <eos> 
Take it easy, I'm pleasing my love <eos> Yeah, it feels like we've really come together <eos> Well she's so fab, I think I'd better lay down <eos> Now please, don't ever let me go <eos> I'm pleading, show me, let me know <eos> Ooh, woo-ooh <eos> She sits back dressed in black <eos> In plain sight as a matter of fact <eos> The same place, same time her love is like a riptide <eos> Well now, please, don't ever let me go <eos> She lives and bleeds Rock 'n' Roll <eos> Well see what she's done to me boys <eos> Well she lays it down for me boys <eos> She says she's got to save the best for me boys <eos> Now see what she's done to me boys <eos> That's right she likes to roll in the limo <eos> When the other girl comes I roll down the window <eos> It's the same place, same time her love is like a riddle <eos> Now please don't ever let me go <eos> Take it easy, it's only Rock 'n' Roll <eos> See what she's got for me boys <eos> How she lays it down for me boys <eos> She says she's got to save the best for me boys <eos> Now see what she's got for me boys <eos> See what she's got for me boys <eos> Well she lays it down for me boys <eos> She says she's got to save the best for me boys <eos> Now see what she's got for me boys <eos> 
You're such an inspiration for the ways <eos> That I will never, ever choose to be <eos> Oh, so many ways for me to show you <eos> How your savior has abandoned you <eos> Fuck your God <eos> Your Lord, your Christ, He did this <eos> Took all you had and left you this way <eos> Still you pray, you never stray, you never <eos> Never taste of the fruit <eos> Never thought to question why <eos> It's not like you killed someone <eos> It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side <eos> Praise the one who left you broken down and paralyzed <eos> He did it all for you <eos> He did it all for you <eos> Oh, so many ways for me to show you <eos> How your dogma has abandoned you <eos> Pray to your Christ, to your God <eos> Never taste of the fruit <eos> Never stray, never break never <eos> Choke on a lie! <eos> Even though He's the one who did this to you <eos> Never thought to question why <eos> Not like you killed someone <eos> It's not like you drove a spiteful spear into his side <eos> Talk to Jesus Christ as if He knows the reasons why <eos> He did it all for you, oh <eos> He did it all for you, woah <eos> He did it all for you <eos> 
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> And I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine <eos> Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all <eos> It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this? <eos> It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss <eos> Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab <eos> While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag <eos> Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick <eos> And it's all in my head, but she's touching his <eos> Chest now, he takes off her <eos> Dress now, let me go <eos> 'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me <eos> They're taking control <eos> Jealousy, turning saints into the sea <eos> Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis <eos> But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me <eos> Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos> I never... <eos>

I wanna tell you all the story 'bout <eos> A Harper Valley widowed  wife <eos> Who had a teenage daughter <eos> Who attended Harper Valley Junior High <eos> Well her daughter came home one afternoon <eos> And didn't even stop to play <eos> And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well the note said Mrs. Johnson <eos> You're wearin' your dresses way too high <eos> It's reported you've been drinking <eos> And a-running round with men and goin' wild <eos> And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up <eos> Your little girl this way <eos> And it was signed by the Secretary <eos> Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet <eos> That very afternoon <eos> And they were sure surprised <eos> When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room <eos> And as she walked up to the blackboard <eos> I can still recall the words she had to say <eos> She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA <eos> Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there <eos> And seven times he asked me for a date <eos> And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice <eos> Whenever he's away <eos> And Mr. Baker can you tell us why <eos> Your secretary had to leave this town? <eos> And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep <eos> Her window shades all pulled completely down <eos> Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here <eos> 'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again <eos> And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath <eos> You'll find she's had a little nip of gin <eos> And then you have the nerve to tell me <eos> You think that as a mother I'm not fit <eos> Well this is just a little Peyton Place <eos> And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites <eos> No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did <eos> It happened just this way <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos> The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA <eos>

As I sit here tonight the jukebox playing <eos> The tune about the wild side of life <eos> As I listen to the words you are saying <eos> It brings memories when I was a trusting wife <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> It's a shame that all the blame is on us women <eos> It's not true that only you men feel the same <eos> From the start most every heart that's ever broken <eos> Was because there always was a man to blame <eos> It wasn't God who made honky tonk angels <eos> As you said in the words of your song <eos> There's many times married men think they're still single <eos> That has caused many a good girl to go wrong <eos> 
Just like that neon sign, I'm buzzing <eos> Just like that full moon, I'm so high <eos> No, it's not what you think, it's not from the drink <eos> It's not from something I'm smoking <eos> Makes me feel like I can fly <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> When I fall and hit rock bottom <eos> When my star comes crashing to the ground <eos> My soft place to land, my steady right hand <eos> You make it all good, you make me feel like a man <eos> You lift me up, you never let me down <eos> Lord knows that you never let me down <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, all my dreams come true <eos> Come morning light waking up next to you, right next to you <eos> Soft candle light, California red <eos> I can't keep my boots on the ground tonight when they're underneath your bed, baby <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, you're looking so fine, you got me up on cloud nine <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Come on kiss me and then, kiss me again and again <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> 
We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> The music played <eos> While our bodies <eos> Displayed through the dance <eos> Then love picked us out for romance <eos> I thought it was clear <eos> The plan was we would share <eos> This feeling just between ourselves <eos> But when the music changed <eos> The plan was rearranged <eos> He went to dance with someone else <eos> We started dancing <eos> And love put us into a groove <eos> But now he's with somebody new <eos> What does love want me to do? <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Guess he's discovered <eos> We are truly lovers <eos> Magic from the very start <eos> 'Cause love just kept me groovin' <eos> And he felt me movin' <eos> Even though we danced apart <eos> So we started dancing <eos> And love put us into the groove <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> As soon as we started to move <eos> Love said <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away <eos> This groove he can't ignore <eos> He won't leave you anymore <eos> (No, no, no) <eos> He tried pretending <eos> A dance is just a dance <eos> But I see <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> He's dancing his way back to me <eos> Love said <eos> (Let the music play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> (He won't get away) <eos> Just keep the groove <eos> And then he'll come back to you again <eos> (Let it play) <eos> Let the music play <eos> He won't get away... <eos>

Yeah <eos> Pack your bags 'cause we got no reason to lay low <eos> What was my line? <eos> Fuck it <eos> Two, three, go <eos> Sing <eos> La-la-la <eos> You always said I'd be a disappointment <eos> That I'd be nothing and I'd probably lose it all <eos> You thought that I would trip and fall <eos> But you'll never see me beg or crawl <eos> Can't take it, won't fake it, punch a hole through the wall, try to break it <eos> Can't change it, rearrange it, so I guess that I'll just have to face it <eos> This is bloody knuckles and I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain, yeah <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> Another day, another disappointment <eos> My head is tripping, might as well just slip away <eos> You all think I'm crazy anyway <eos> You all think I'm crazy <eos> Won't give in, never fit in, it's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> You dig in, don't pretend, I'm already down, but you keep on pushing <eos> Life is a fight, but you don't ever fight fair <eos> Beat us to the ground, but we will never stay there <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> I won't give in, never fit in <eos> It's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> This is bloody knuckles, I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain <eos> Away from all this pain <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> 
So I heard you found somebody else <eos> And at first, I thought it was a lie <eos> I took all my things that make sounds <eos> The rest I can do without <eos> I don't want your body <eos> But I hate to think about you with somebody else <eos> Our love has gone cold <eos> You're intertwining your soul with somebody else <eos> I'm looking through you <eos> While you're looking through your phone <eos> And then leaving with somebody else <eos> No, I don't want your body <eos> But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...) <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> And c'mon baby (I know) <eos> This ain't the last time that I'll see your face <eos> And c'mon baby (I know) <eos> You said you'd find someone to take my place (Place, place) <eos> I just don't believe that you have got it in you <eos> 'Cause we are just gonna keep “Doin' it” and every time <eos> I start to believe in anything you're saying <eos> I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it <eos> I don't want your body <eos> But I hate to think about you with somebody else <eos> Our love has gone cold <eos> You're intertwining your soul with somebody else <eos> I'm looking through you <eos> While you're looking through your phone <eos> And then leaving with somebody else <eos> No, I don't want your body <eos> But I'm picturing your body with somebody else (Else, else...) <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> I don't want your body, I don't want your body <eos> Get someone you love? <eos> Get someone you need? <eos> Fuck that, get money <eos> I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone <eos> Get someone you love? <eos> Get someone you need? <eos> Fuck that, get money <eos> I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone <eos> Get someone you love? <eos> Get someone you need? <eos> Fuck that, get money <eos> I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone <eos> Get someone you love? <eos> Get someone you need? <eos> Fuck that, get money <eos> I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone <eos> I don't want your body (I don't want your body) <eos> But I hate to think about you with somebody else <eos> (I don't want your body) <eos> Our love has gone cold <eos> You're intertwining your soul with somebody else <eos> (I don't want your body) <eos> I'm looking through you <eos> While you're looking through your phone <eos> And then leaving with somebody else <eos> (I don't want your body) <eos> No, I don't want your body (I don't want your body) <eos> But I'm picturing your body with somebody else <eos> (I don't want your body) <eos> 
Born today <eos> Under a raped morning sun <eos> Burned to death <eos> Like a witch in a fire stake <eos> Holy flames <eos> My demons bring it all <eos> With promises you gave <eos> A life so bright <eos> Like summer sun <eos> Doomed forever by things undone <eos> Holy mother <eos> You loved me, don't you? <eos> Holy mother <eos> You loved me, don't you? <eos> Why let me suffer <eos> From love with ghosts <eos> Holy mother <eos> You loved me not <eos> I asked for water <eos> You offered blood <eos> I ached like human <eos> You said I'm god <eos> You washed my soul <eos> In blood of prophets <eos> My skin turned black <eos> I lost my senses <eos> Love eternal in grave with worms and mud <eos> Failed to save her, she is buried in the past <eos> Faith grabbed hope and tore her soul apart <eos> I am a human, I am not your fucking god <eos> Love eternal in grave with worms and mud <eos> Failed to save her, she is buried in the past <eos> Faith grabbed hope and tore her soul apart <eos> I am a human, I am not your fucking god <eos> I asked for water <eos> You offered blood <eos> I ached like human <eos> You said I'm god <eos> Drink my tears, do you feel the wrath? <eos> I never meant to harm you <eos> Drink my tears, do you feel the wrath? <eos> I never meant to harm you <eos> I fall like hammer <eos> Like a curse upon you <eos> Screaming thunder <eos> The ghosts of horror hunt you <eos> I fall with menace <eos> With anger great <eos> This fake heaven <eos> In flames will end <eos>

For all those times you stood by me <eos> For all the truth that you made me see <eos> For all the joy you brought to my life <eos> For all the wrong that you made right <eos> For every dream you made come true <eos> For all the love I found in you <eos> I would be forever thankful, baby <eos> You're the one who held me up <eos> Never let me fall <eos> You're the one who saw me through, through it all <eos> You were my strength when I was weak <eos> You were my voice when I couldn't speak <eos> You were my eyes when I couldn't see <eos> You saw the best there was in me <eos> Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <eos> You gave me faith 'cause you believed <eos> I'm everything I am <eos> Because you loved me <eos> You gave me wings and made me fly <eos> You touched my hand, I could touch the sky <eos> I lost my faith, you gave it back to me <eos> You said no star was out of reach <eos> You stood by me and I stood tall <eos> I had your love, I had it all <eos> I'm grateful for each day you gave me <eos> Maybe I don't know that much <eos> But I know this much is true <eos> I was blessed because I was loved by you <eos> You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength) <eos> You were my voice when I couldn't speak <eos> You were my eyes when I couldn't see <eos> You saw the best there was in me <eos> Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <eos> You gave me faith 'cause you believed <eos> I'm everything I am <eos> Because you loved me <eos> You were always there for me <eos> The tender wind that carried me <eos> A light in the dark, shining your love into my life <eos> You've been my inspiration <eos> Through the lies, you were the truth <eos> My world is a better place because of you <eos> You were my strength when I was weak (You were my strength) <eos> You were my voice when I couldn't speak (When I couldn't speak) <eos> You were my eyes when I couldn't see <eos> You saw the best there was in me <eos> Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <eos> You gave me faith 'cause you believed <eos> I'm everything I am <eos> Because you loved me <eos> You were my strength when I was weak <eos> You were my voice when I couldn't speak (My voice) <eos> You were my eyes when I couldn't see <eos> You saw the best there was in me <eos> Lifted me up when I couldn't reach <eos> You gave me faith 'cause you believed <eos> I'm everything I am <eos> Because you loved me <eos> Oh <eos> I'm everything I am <eos> Because you loved me <eos> 
Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Mi querida <eos> Madre mía, yo recuerdo <eos> Madre mía, tu cabello como cataratas <eos> Madre mía, tus labios colorados de un rojo sangriento <eos> Madre mía, tus tacones se anunciaban <eos> Madre mía, martillazos se escuchaban por los pasillos <eos> Madre mía, enfrentemos a los hechos <eos> Madre mía, el cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Yo recuerdo amenazas a cuchillo, riñas animales <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Yo no supe qué hacer <eos> Ante tus poderes descomunales <eos> Madre mía, yo he heredado tu abismo <eos> Madre mía, te perdono <eos> Fuiste más que suficiente <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, mi querida <eos> Madre mía, no quedan palabras por decir <eos> Yo aprendí tu idioma <eos> Pero aún me rehuso a hablarlo <eos> Me duele en el alma <eos> Me duele todo de mí <eos> La distancia no fue sino mi única opción, mi única opción <eos> Yo me siento convertir en ti <eos> Madre mía, qué ironía <eos> Madre mía, qué alegría <eos> Yo he heredado tus abismos descomunales <eos> El cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Hasta que lo hice yo <eos> Madre mía, celestial <eos> Eres para siempre, para siempre <eos> Madre mía <eos> Mi origen y mi fin <eos> 
I stopped looking for your truck <eos> Every time I go somewhere <eos> I don't scroll through the past anymore 'cause I don't care <eos> I'm finally putting on the shirt I like <eos> Tight jeans, big hoops with my hair up high <eos> The least you could've done was give me the bar tonight <eos> Why'd you have to come back in right then <eos> Right when I was just getting good and gone? <eos> 'Cause I was in the wrong place at the wrong time <eos> You must've heard I was moving on <eos> Then right out of the blue <eos> A quarter past two, I'm all about you <eos> When I was just about, just about over you <eos> I was just about, just about over you <eos> You could've stayed with the guys, acting like you didn't see me <eos> I would've hurt a little less if you bought some girl a drink <eos> But you had to walk up, messing me up <eos> I'm drunk wondering why it's gotta be like this <eos> I thought that I was moving on, but now I'm starting back over again <eos> Why'd you have to come back in right then <eos> Right when I was just getting good and gone <eos> 'Cause I was in the wrong place at the wrong time <eos> You must've heard I was moving on <eos> Then right out of the blue <eos> A quarter past two, I'm all about you <eos> When I was just about, just about over you <eos> I was just about, just about over you <eos> Maybe you caught me on a bad night <eos> Maybe tomorrow I'll be just fine <eos> Maybe it's the red wine <eos> That put you back in my mind <eos> Why'd you have to come back in right then <eos> Right when I was just getting good and gone? <eos> 'Cause I was in the wrong place at the wrong time <eos> You must've heard I was moving on <eos> Then right out of the blue <eos> A quarter past two, I'm all about you <eos> When I was just about, just about over you, oh-oh <eos> I was just about over you <eos> 
How can someone stand so damn close <eos> And feel like they're worlds away? <eos> I can see your sad story eyes <eos> So how do you have no words to say? <eos> All I want is to fall in deeper <eos> Than I've ever been <eos> Why won't you let me? <eos> I can handle your heart, so help me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright <eos> Through the dark for the both of us <eos> And "I've done it outta love" is not enough <eos> But God, how I wish it was <eos> And I don't wanna find out <eos> How much lonely I can take before you lose me <eos> Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> I can't let it go <eos> From moments in your arms <eos> But they come back again <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> 
A complicated sunset <eos> Sets the mood within the room <eos> All bets are up and <eos> We keep looking down <eos> To try and find <eos> The will to turn this around <eos> I spent the last three months <eos> In mental traction <eos> Woeing all I could forsee <eos> I slept myself free and <eos> Cursed at all awake <eos> The medicine I'd take <eos> I broke down <eos> On the train to southtown <eos> Midway inbound <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> I held out <eos> Carrying this crutch around <eos> Angry words came rushing out <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> Now I could pound on the keys so hard and <eos> Make the mallets slap the strings and <eos> Pump the pedals till I'm breathless and <eos> Sing off key and <eos> Wouldn't that be just like me? <eos> Now people in the back yell hey <eos> When they see me today <eos> I got a smile so wide it stems offstage <eos> They say go go you gone soul and <eos> For all I know <eos> They now know <eos> Oh no <eos> You broke down <eos> As I tore the pages out <eos> During all the painful parts <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> You held out <eos> Carrying your diary around <eos> Angry ink came rushing out <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> So we finished the night and <eos> We laud the long ride <eos> Because it leads to my own bed <eos> So at least tonight <eos> My head will be alright <eos> We broke down <eos> Miles out of Morgantown <eos> A midnight rainstorm crashing down <eos> Not one breathing soul around <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos>

De tanto correr por la vida sin freno <eos> Me olvidé que la vida se vive un momento <eos> De tanto querer ser en todo el primero <eos> Me olvidé de vivir los detalles pequeños <eos> De tanto jugar con los sentimientos <eos> Viviendo de aplausos envueltos en sueños <eos> De tanto gritar mis canciones al viento <eos> Ya no soy como ayer, ya no se lo que siento <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> De tanto cantarle al amor y la vida <eos> Me quede sin amor una noche de un día <eos> De tanto jugar con quien más yo quería <eos> Perdí sin querer lo mejor que tenía <eos> De tanto ocultar la verdad con mentiras <eos> Me engañé sin saber que era yo quien perdía <eos> De tanto esperar, yo que nunca ofrecía <eos> Hoy me toca llorar, yo que siempre reía <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> De tanto correr por ganar tiempo al tiempo <eos> Queriendo robarle a mis noches el sueño <eos> De tanto fracasos, de tantos intentos <eos> Por querer descubrir cada día algo nuevo <eos> De tanto jugar con los sentimientos <eos> Viviendo de aplausos envueltos en sueños <eos> De tanto gritar mis canciones al viento <eos> Ya no soy como ayer, ya no se lo que siento <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> Me olvidé de vivir, Me olvidé de vivir <eos> 
I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye <eos> I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time <eos> Everything is 3D blasphemy <eos> My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up <eos> This is not the way I pictured me <eos> I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? <eos> Something about this, so very wrong <eos> I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this <eos> Is it a dream or a memory? <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this? <eos> But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate <eos> I have sinned by just <eos> Making my mind up and taking your breath away <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye! <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> And it waits for you <eos> 
Ocean tides keep turning baby <eos> Pull me under, think they heard me <eos> If only I told you another shot is all I'm getting right now <eos> Falling to something only gets too much <eos> Falling to something only gets too much <eos> Feels like I'm burning bridges <eos> Feels like I'm burning <eos> I feel like burning bridges now <eos> Don't forget I heard you loud <eos> If your love can feel like that <eos> Feel like that <eos> Ocean tides keep turning baby <eos> Pull me under, think they heard me <eos> If only I told you another shot is all I'm getting right now <eos> Falling to something only gets too much <eos> Falling to something only gets too much <eos> Feels like I'm burning bridges <eos> Feels like I'm burning <eos> I feel like burning bridges now <eos> Don't forget I hеard you loud <eos> If your love can feel like that <eos> Feel like that <eos> 
My friends are so depressed <eos> I feel the question of your loneliness <eos> Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side <eos> You know I will, you know I will <eos> Ex-girlfriend called me up <eos> Alone and desperate on a prison phone <eos> They want to give her seven years <eos> For being sad <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> My friends are so distressed <eos> And standing on the brink of emptiness <eos> No words I know of to express <eos> This emptiness <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> Imagine me <eos> Taught by tragedy <eos> Release is peace <eos> I heard a little girl <eos> And what she said was something beautiful <eos> To give your love no matter what <eos> Was what she said <eos> I love all of you <eos> Hurt by the cold <eos> So hard and lonely too <eos> When you don't know yourself <eos> 
Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> It's like no other pain I've ever known <eos> To love someone so much, to have no control <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos> But I think I'm lost without you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> 'Cause I've been strong for so long <eos> I never thought how much I needed you <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> Strangers rushing past, just tryna get home <eos> You were the only safe haven that I've known <eos> Hits me at full speed, feel like I can't breathe <eos> And nobody knows this pain inside me <eos> My world is crumbling, I should never have let you go <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> I think I'm lost, lost, lost <eos> Ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh, ooh <eos> I think I'm lost without you, you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> And I've been strong for so long <eos> But I never thought how much I love you <eos> Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos> 
Well I never felt more like singing the blues <eos> 'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose <eos> Your love dear why'd you do me this way <eos> Well I never felt more like crying all night <eos> 'Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right <eos> Without you you got me singing the blues <eos> The moon and stars no longer shine <eos> The dream is gone I thought was mine <eos> There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you <eos> Well I never felt more like running away <eos> But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay <eos> Without you you got me singing the blues <eos> Well I never felt more like singing the blues <eos> 'Cause I never thought that I'd ever lose <eos> Your love dear why'd you do me this way <eos> Well I never felt more like crying all night <eos> 'Cause everything's wrong and nothing ain't right <eos> Without you you got me singing the blues <eos> The moon and stars no longer shine <eos> The dream is gone I thought was mine <eos> There's nothing left for me to do but cry over you <eos> Well I never felt more like running away <eos> But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay <eos> Without you you got me singing the blues <eos> 
Uh, uh, uh <eos> No sé como empezó todo, mas hoy te amo <eos> Después de un gran sufrimiento vino mi amor <eos> Yo sé lo que es el tormento venido del sentimiento <eos> Y ahora se regocija mi corazón <eos> Todo esto se fue escribiendo día con día <eos> Tal vez en la hipocresía de un gran amor <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Uh, uh, uh <eos> No sé como empezó todo, más hoy te amo <eos> Después de un gran sufrimiento vino mi amor <eos> Yo sé lo que es el tormento venido del sentimiento <eos> Y ahora se regocija mi corazón <eos> Todo esto se fue escribiendo día con día <eos> Tal vez en la hipocresía de un gran amor <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> Tu vida cambió mi vida, muchachita consentida <eos> Y ahora te doy las gracias con mi canción <eos> 
They say "Love is more precious than gold" <eos> Can't be bought and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> I got a woman with eyes that shine <eos> Down deep, as a diamond mine <eos> She's my treasure, so very rare <eos> She made me a millionaire <eos> When we ride around, ride around this old town <eos> In my beat-up car, with the windows down <eos> People look at her and they look at me <eos> And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury" <eos> Sweet luxury <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought no, never could be sold <eos> I got love, enough to share <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> When the kisses fall from everywhere <eos> Like riches on a millionaire <eos> When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare <eos> I still feel like a millionaire <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> 
Summer through the window <eos> But I can't seem to let go <eos> And I know that I should feel a little better 'bout it but I don't <eos> Water running off my skin <eos> Trying to find a way to let you in <eos> And I know the puzzle pieces wanna fit together but they won't <eos> And I'd be the first to <eos> Be there for you <eos> If you needed me to <eos> But can't turn the tide <eos> I'm paralyzed <eos> What do I do <eos> Show me what I can't see <eos> 'Cause I don't recognise me <eos> Wide awake in my sleep <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos> I'm tripping over my feet <eos> With promises I can't keep <eos> I don't recognise me <eos> And it scares mе, oh it scares me <eos> Everybody's happy <eos> Evеrybody but me <eos> And I know it's just the voices in my head getting the best of me <eos> Yeah I thought that I would be alright <eos> Thought I'd put up a better fight <eos> Maybe now I need your help to get it back to where it's supposed to be <eos> And I'd be the first to <eos> Be there for you <eos> If you needed me to <eos> But can't turn the tide <eos> I'm paralyzed <eos> What do I do <eos> Show me what I can't see <eos> 'Cause I don't recognise me <eos> Wide awake in my sleep <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos> I'm tripping over my feet <eos> With promises I can't keep <eos> I don't recognise me <eos> And it scares me, oh it scares me <eos>

Tranquilito, despacito <eos> Voy subiendo a mi ritmo <eos> No llevamos prisa, el que visualiza lo materializa <eos> Le estoy dando de qué hablar a <eos> Los pericos, siguen viendo <eos> Cómo voy creciendo <eos> Y es solo el comienzo <eos> Si tuve tropiezos, no fue suficiente y ​para detenerme, no <eos> No les daré el gusto de verme mal <eos> Aquí hay con queso pa' las enchiladas pa' poderme levantar si no <eos> El que no me crea, le puede calar <eos> El quе busca, encuentra y se van a topar <eos> Y poco a poco, sе anda lejos <eos> En las buenas, todos andan <eos> En las malas, se acobardan <eos> Subes y te llaman; bajas, nadie te habla <eos> Así está la tranza <eos> Tengo gente de confianza <eos> Que me protege la espalda <eos> Sonrisa en mi cara, no hay noticias malas <eos> Los verdes no faltan <eos> Regresé más fuerte, claro que se puede <eos> Yo estoy firme con la gente, sí <eos> Que conmigo siempre se portó leal <eos> El negocio avanza, esto es una balanza <eos> Cuídate del agua mansa, sí <eos> Merecido me tengo este lugar <eos> Hagan lo que hagan, no voy a parar <eos> Estoy listo pa' jala <eos>

Do you feel sorry for yourself? when you make the same mistakes, tracing your boy's hands. yeah, we all have regrets, and we all can make mistakes. tracing these old plans is code red. have you ever felt so bad? when you're hiding in your room, and you can hardly get out of your bed. you've got your hands behind your back. you've given up. yeah, we've all been there. we know how it goes. when you'd rather disappear, then you might as well be dead. even I'll be holding on when the days get too long, its hard not to just hold on. you hope that its the end, tomorrow it starts again, and its impossible to be strong. even I'll be holding on to the times it all seemed gone. when all the problems seemed solved. days your back breaks, and only black is in your heart, even I'll be holding on <eos> 
Era uma vez <eos> Um rasgo de magia <eos> Dança de sombra e de luz <eos> De sonho e fantasia <eos> Num ritual que me seduz <eos> Cinema que me dás tanta alegria <eos> Deixa a música <eos> Crescer nesta cadência <eos> Na tela do meu caração <eos> Voltar a ser criança <eos> E assim esquecer a solidão <eos> Os alhos a brilhar <eos> Numa sala escura <eos> Voa a 24 imagens por segundo <eos> Meu comovida caração <eos> Aprendeu a voar <eos> Neste Cinema Paraíso <eos> Que eu trago no olhar <eos> E também no sorriso <eos> 
When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When you're close to me, I can feel your heartbeat <eos> I can hear you breathing near my ear <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> Anytime you want to you can turn me onto <eos> Anything you want to, anytime at all <eos> When I kiss your lips, ooh, I start to shiver <eos> Can't control the quivering inside <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> When I'm feelin' blue, all I have to do <eos> Is take a look at you, then I'm not so blue <eos> When I'm in your arms, nothing seems to matter <eos> My whole world could shatter, I don't care <eos> Wouldn't you agree <eos> Baby, you and me <eos> Got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos> Oh, oh-oh-oh <eos> We got a groovy kind of love <eos>

I've been dreaming, friendly faces <eos> I've got so much time to kill <eos> Just imagine people laughing <eos> I know some day we will <eos> And even if it's far away <eos> Get me through another day <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> Shower me with good times <eos> Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning <eos> And everything'll be alright <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> From a distance all these mountains <eos> Are just some tiny hills <eos> Wildflowers, they keep living <eos> While they're just standing still <eos> I've been missing yesterday <eos> But what if there's a better place? <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> Shower me with good times <eos> Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning <eos> And everything'll be alright <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> Shower me with good times <eos> Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning <eos> And everything'll be alright <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> La la la la <eos> La la la la <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos> Shower me with good times <eos> Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning <eos> And everything'll be alright <eos> Cover me in sunshine <eos>

(Last night, all I think about is you <eos> Don't stop, baby, you can walk through <eos> Don't want, baby, think about you <eos> You know that I'm never gonna lose) <eos> Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <eos> Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror <eos> Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <eos> Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a— <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> Usually I put somethin' on TV <eos> So we never think about you and me <eos> But today I see our reflections clearly <eos> In Hollywood, layin' on the screen <eos> You just need a better life than this <eos> You need somethin' I can never give <eos> Fake water all across the road <eos> It's gone now, the night has come, but <eos> Sometimes all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> You can't fight it, you can't breathe <eos> You say somethin' so lovin', but <eos> Now I gotta let you go <eos> You'll be better off in someone new <eos> I don't wanna be alone <eos> You know it hurts me too <eos> You look so broken when you cry <eos> One more and then I'll say goodbye <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> I just wonder what you're dreamin' of <eos> When you sleep and smile so comfortable <eos> I just wish that I could give you that <eos> That look that's perfectly un-sad <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> Sometimes, all I think about is you <eos> Late nights in the middle of June <eos> Heat waves been fakin' me out <eos> Can't make you happier now <eos> Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <eos> Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror <eos> Road shimmer wigglin' the vision <eos> Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror <eos> 
Loving you isn't the right thing to do <eos> How can I ever change things that I feel? <eos> If I could, maybe I'd give you my world <eos> How can I when you won't take it from me? <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> Tell me why everything turned around <eos> Packing up, shacking up's all you wanna do <eos> If I could, baby, I'd give you my world <eos> Open up, everything's waiting for you <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day, another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way, go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way <eos> You can call it another lonely day <eos> You can go your own way <eos> 
Knew the signs, wasn't right <eos> I was stupid for a while <eos> Swept away by you <eos> And now I feel like a fool <eos> So confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> Catch myself from despair <eos> I could drown if I stay here <eos> Keeping busy every day <eos> I know I will be okay <eos> But I was so confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> So much hurt, so much pain <eos> Takes a while to regain <eos> What is lost inside <eos> And I hope that, in time <eos> You'll be out of my mind <eos> And I'll be over you <eos> But now I'm so confused <eos> My heart's bruised <eos> Was I ever loved by you? <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> I never had your heart <eos> Out of reach, couldn't see <eos> We were never meant to be <eos> Out of reach, so far <eos> You never gave your heart <eos> In my reach, I can see <eos> There's a life out there for me <eos>

Quand'è che spento il cuore? <eos> Che ho smesso di sognare <eos> Un nuovo amore? <eos> Il dubbio dentro me <eos> E ho smesso di sperare <eos> Ma a un tratto, tu <eos> Risvegli nel profondo <eos> Un fuoco che mi accende <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and resterò <eos> Per costruire un sogno <eos> One more time <eos> Who cares about the past? <eos> Who knows about tomorrow? <eos> L'amore è adesso <eos> And maybe this won't last <eos> Maybe this moment's all we have <eos> Let's find out <eos> And though I'm still afraid <eos> You're worth a leap of faith <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> To see the world that we make <eos> I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> As if my heart cannot break <eos> One more time <eos> Here and now, up against the edge <eos> Promise me you won't look down <eos> Won't fall off the ledge <eos> Take my hand and show me how to love again <eos> And I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> Per costruire ancora <eos> One more time <eos>

I'm leaving this town tomorrow <eos> I got many places to see <eos> And many places to go <eos> I'm so tired of doing the same old thing <eos> Shooting for the highest star <eos> Want people to remember my name <eos> If you don't understand <eos> Let me break it down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> I have friends and family that I see everyday <eos> Don't plan on moving forward <eos> Stuck in the same old place <eos> But that's not the road that I wanna go down <eos> I gotta do what's best for me <eos> Ain't no hanging around <eos> I could stay here forever <eos> But I just can't stick around <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> When the rooster crows I'm leaving <eos> And I ain't looking back <eos> All you gonna see is taillights <eos> Crossing those railroad tracks <eos> If I don't leave I'll die here <eos> And end up six feet down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> 
Well, I was nineteen, you were twenty-one <eos> The year we got engaged <eos> And everyone said we were much too young <eos> But we did it anyway <eos> We got the rings for forty each <eos> From a pawn shop down the road <eos> We said our vows and took the leap <eos> Now fifteen years ago <eos> And we went dancing in the minefields <eos> We went sailing in the storms <eos> And it was harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> "I do" are the two most famous last words <eos> The beginning of the end <eos> But to lose your life for another, I've heard <eos> Is a good place to begin <eos> 'Cause the only way to find your life <eos> Is to lay your own life down <eos> And I believe it's an easy price <eos> For the life that we have found <eos> And we're dancing in the minefields <eos> We're sailing in the storms <eos> This is harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> That's what the promise is for <eos> So when I loose my way, find me <eos> When I loose love's chains, bind me <eos> At the end of all my faith, till the end of all my days <eos> When I forget my name, remind me <eos> 'Cause we bear the light of the Son of Man <eos> So there's nothing left to fear <eos> So I'll walk with you in the shadowlands <eos> Till the shadows disappear <eos> 'Cause he promised not to leave us <eos> And his promises are true <eos> So in the face of all this chaos <eos> Baby, I can dance with you <eos> So let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> Let's go sailing in the storms <eos> Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> And kicking down the doors <eos> Oh, let's go dancing in the minefields <eos> And sailing in the storms <eos> Oh, this is harder than we dreamed <eos> But I believe that's what the promise is for <eos> That's what the promise is for <eos> 
I move your picture from my wall <eos> I replace them both large and small <eos> And each new day finds me so blue <eos> But nothing takes the place of you <eos> I read your letters one by one <eos> I still love you when it's all said and done <eos> And oh, my darling, I'm so blue <eos> Because nothing, oh, nothing, takes the place of you <eos> And I write this letter <eos> It's raining on my windowpane <eos> Oh, I feel the need of you <eos> Because without you nothing seems the same <eos> And I write this letter <eos> It's raining on my windowpane <eos> Oh, I feel the need of you <eos> Becausе without you nothing seems the same <eos> So I'll wait until you're homе <eos> Again I'll love you but I am all alone <eos> Oh my darling, I'm so blue <eos> Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you <eos> 
I don't tell 'em all the things you said <eos> I don't tell 'em 'bout the nights you left <eos> I don't show 'em these texts I saved <eos> All the games you played <eos> They don't know nothing 'bout it <eos> Whenever somebody says your name <eos> I don't break, I just say <eos> It's for the best, it's over now <eos> Wasn't anyone's fault it didn't work out <eos> She's a good girl, just wasn't the one <eos> We wanted different things, we had a good run <eos> She's better off and so am I <eos> It is what it is, yeah, it's alright <eos> I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart <eos> I just tell 'em that we grew apart <eos> I could tell 'em how you came in late, ooh-ooh <eos> I could tell 'em how you looked me in the eye <eos> And told that lie with a straight face <eos> I don't know why I don't <eos> Maybe I hope it ain't really over <eos> But what's that say about me? <eos> Am I that weak? <eos> 'Cause I just keep saying <eos> It's for the best, it's over now <eos> Wasn't anyone's fault it didn't work out <eos> She's a good girl, just wasn't the one <eos> We wanted different things, we had a good run <eos> I'm better off, and so am I <eos> It is what it is, yeah it's alright <eos> I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart <eos> I just tell 'em that we grew apart <eos> I don't drag your name through the mud <eos> But, baby, we both know I could, maybe I should, yeah <eos> It's for the best, it's over now <eos> Wasn't anyone's fault it didn't work out <eos> She's a good girl, I just wasn't the one <eos> We wanted different things, we had a good run <eos> She's better off, so am I <eos> It is what it is, but it's all a lie <eos> I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart <eos> I just tell 'em that we grew apart <eos> Ooh, you broke my heart <eos> Yeah, we grew apart <eos> 
Dear Haley <eos> Can you save me from the borrowed cloud I'm on <eos> All you gotta do is try <eos> Pray you're just getting by <eos> Hey wait I thought you'd made it <eos> How'd your bottled crown fall off <eos> Tell me how'd you get so tired <eos> Faded down to the wire <eos> Try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise <eos> Wasting time, so very ordinary <eos> Wait until my bomb goes off <eos> See the actors run and hide <eos> Fake it all in stride <eos> One day we all can say we're gone <eos> And haunt the ground we're from <eos> Everything's so open wide <eos> Here within the divide <eos> Try living a lie and kicking out the same old guise <eos> Wasting time <eos> Ain't it the life, got no crime, just sail on by <eos> 
We're sittin' 'round on the couch <eos> We were makin' words with our mouths <eos> We had a pile of junk <eos> That's already runnin' out <eos> You think we're out of stuff <eos> But, hey, I'll tell you what <eos> Look, there's a little left there in the corner <eos> And I ain't had enough <eos> There's some more fun to be had <eos> If you lick the bag <eos> Well, turn the bag inside out <eos> And rub it in your mouth <eos> Suck on it for a while <eos> To get the rest of it out <eos> And if you're feelin' down <eos> You can lick the bag <eos> There ain't enough of it left <eos> To make a little line <eos> No need to get upset <eos> Yeah, you don't need to cry <eos> 'Cause there's some more fun to be had <eos> Lyin' in the corners of the bag <eos> So shove it in your mouth <eos> Yeah, you can lick the bag <eos> There's some more fun to be had <eos> If you lick the bag <eos> Bag <eos> Gather 'round, gather 'round <eos> Hey, kids, I wanna know something <eos> Are we all out of that good stuff? (No) <eos> And have we had enough? (No) <eos> Tell me what we're gonna do with that bag <eos> (We're gonna lick it) <eos> What did you say, kids? <eos> (Lick the bag) <eos> I said what did you say, kids? <eos> (Lick the bag) <eos> 
Last week my life had meaning <eos> It was beautiful and so sweet <eos> But now it's nothing <eos> Nothing without you, baby <eos> My whole world is incomplete <eos> 'Cause honey I can't see you no more <eos> That was all that you said, baby <eos> But you just might as well have <eos> Placed a gun to my head <eos> Baby, baby, oh, why did you do it <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Yeah, yes it did, honey <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground, baby <eos> Did you ever mean those sweet things <eos> Ah, that you use to say <eos> Did you mean 'em baby <eos> Of a house with a lovely, lovely garden <eos> And a little baby someday <eos> Oh, tell me, baby <eos> Where did I go wrong, honey <eos> Whatever changed your mind, baby <eos> I've asked myself these questions over a million times <eos> Baby, baby, oh, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Oh, yes it did, baby, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground, baby, baby, baby <eos> Oh baby, now my body is numb <eos> I feel, feel so senseless to the touch <eos> My life is so wasted <eos> So wasted without you <eos> I guess I love too much, too much <eos> Oh, baby, how can I face tomorrow <eos> When yesterday is all I see <eos> I just don't want to face tomorrow <eos> If you're not sharing it with me <eos> Baby, baby, oh, tell me why <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> Oh, yes it did, baby, baby <eos> My whole world ended <eos> The moment you left me <eos> It tumbled down to the ground <eos> Baby, I keep holding on, holding on <eos> Although your love is gone, baby <eos>

Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos>

We've been to both Carolinas <eos> Seen a big Montana sky <eos> Driven up and down a coast a few times <eos> London, Paris, paradise <eos> But ain't got much memory of the scenes <eos> Come to think, I miss them all <eos> And damn, babe, it's all your fault <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach? <eos> You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea <eos> And the night rolled in <eos> And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall <eos> But God, I saw all I needed to <eos> Might as well have stayed in the room <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Don't you remember Times Square? <eos> And people counting down everywhere <eos> 2000-whatever, no, I didn't care <eos> 'Cause baby you were there <eos> And once again, couldn't help but stare <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> Halfway around the world <eos> Or the local corner booth <eos> Yeah, you guessed it, girl <eos> You know I got my eyes on you <eos> We could be on any street <eos> Any party, any room <eos> I'll be there all night with my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> 
Got a piece of my mind, to tell you who's mine <eos> Nobody hurts like me for you. <eos> Soft slacks at night, I'm wearing 'em tight <eos> Nobody hurts like I do. <eos> Your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine <eos> So stop feeding me, 'a little more time' <eos> Your shit's a mess, I'm not yours to undress <eos> I'm leaving this love for the last time. <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine. <eos> You've got the means to caress, but weak you leave me a mess <eos> One touch is enough, your hands, a little too rough <eos> Will I ever be enough? <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> We fall the fader to black, release the ropes and feel the slack <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I tell you every time, you're walking a fine, fine line <eos> I'm not yours, I'm mine <eos> I'm not yours <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> Heard it all before <eos> 
If I had a gun <eos> I'd shoot a hole into the sun <eos> And love would burn this city down for you <eos> If I had the time <eos> I'd stop the world and make you mine <eos> And every day would stay the same with you <eos> I'll give you back a dream <eos> Show you now what might have been <eos> If all the tears you cry would fade away (away, away, away...) <eos> I'll be by your side <eos> When they come to say goodbye <eos> We will live to fight another day <eos> Excuse me if I spoke too soon <eos> My eyes have always followed you around the room <eos> 'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need <eos> I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me <eos> Hope I didn't speak too soon <eos> My eyes have always followed you around the room <eos> 'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need <eos> I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment <eos> For my heart to be unbroken by the seams <eos> Let me fly you to the moon <eos> My eyes have always followed you around the room <eos> 'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need <eos> I'm holding on, I'm waiting for the moment to find me <eos> If I had a gun <eos> I'd shoot a hole into the sun <eos> And love would burn this city down for you <eos> 
Mamo, nie płacz, nie <eos> Niebios Przeczysta Królowo <eos> Ty zawsze wspieraj mnie <eos> Zdrowaś Mario <eos> 
With no makeup on and your eyelash hanging <eos> I would still love you <eos> If you came home late and you kept me waiting <eos> I would still trust you <eos> If the richer man was looking at you <eos> Would you stay cold as a statue? <eos> Would my love still be good for you? <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'? <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' mornin'? <eos> Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise? <eos> When I open up both eyes <eos> Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' <eos> If I pass out drunk and you check my message <eos> And see my exes <eos> Would you still believe that it's only just us <eos> And I'm not reckless? <eos> Would you know if I ever laid with another lover? <eos> We was on a break, babe and I wore a rubber <eos> Would you forgive me? <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'? <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'? <eos> Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise? <eos> When I open up both eyes <eos> Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' <eos> And last night, last night <eos> I dreamed of a woman <eos> Dark brown eyes <eos> Daddy told her all she knows <eos> She brought me to life <eos> She set my soul in motion <eos> And there's only one thing that I gotta know <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'? <eos> Would you be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' , mornin'? <eos> Would you stay here from the sunset to the sunrise? <eos> When I open up both eyes <eos> Be there in the mornin', mornin', mornin' <eos> 
Tapping time with one good finger <eos> I got this girlfriend and she's a swinger <eos> We make plans and then we head out to <eos> San Bernardino <eos> We get gas at the local P & M <eos> Buy a coke in a can made of tin <eos> We drink fast because <eos> We're headed out west to San Bernardino <eos> And we shall miss Carolina <eos> And the east coast as opposed to the west <eos> We won't shed any tears though <eos> Nor even be sad because we know <eos> The western desert is the best! <eos> I filled a bag with cigarettes and apple wine <eos> We'll hit the road again at 10 minutes to 9 <eos> Me and this girl I think she's pregnant <eos> And we're headed to San Bernardino <eos> And then when we hit Texas <eos> We'll stop in Amarillo for a bite to eat <eos> We'll stop on over in Dallas <eos> And visit my friend but we can't stay <eos> For more than a week <eos> I've got the south in my veins <eos> But California in my mouth <eos> And that's the simple reason <eos> Why i'm leaving the south <eos> Me and this girl and she's so foxy <eos> And we're heading to San Bernardino <eos> Whoo <eos> That was close we crossed the Tennessee state border <eos> They would've locked us up by the sheriff's order <eos> Yes we're freaks <eos> But they can't touch us out west <eos> In San Bernardino <eos> 
And with the early dawn moving right along <eos> I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep <eos> And in the aching night under satellites <eos> I was not received <eos> Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart <eos> Someone get me a priest <eos> To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head <eos> Is this a cure or is this a disease? <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in the after birth on the quiet earth <eos> Let the stains remind you <eos> You thought you made a man, you better think again <eos> Before my role defines you <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in your waiting hands, I will land <eos> And roll out of my skin <eos> And in your final hours, I will stand <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos>

One, two <eos> When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school <eos> His mind would turn unto the waters <eos> Always the focus of adolescent ridicule <eos> He has no time for farmer’s daughters <eos> Alienated from the clique society <eos> A lonely boy finds peace in fishing <eos> His mother says, "John this is not the way life's supposed to be <eos> Don't you see the life that you are missing?" <eos> And he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> Now years gone by, we find a man that rules the sea <eos> He sets out on a dark May morning <eos> To bring his catch back to this small community <eos> He doesn’t see the danger dawning <eos> Four hours up, oh, the ocean swelled and swelled <eos> The fog rolled in, it started raining <eos> The starboard bow, oh my god, we're going down <eos> They do not hear his frantic mayday <eos> As he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> I'll live and die a fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> We call him John the fisherman <eos> 
Miren como nos hablan de libertad <eos> Cuando de ella nos privan en realidad <eos> Miren como pregonan tranquilidad <eos> Cuando nos atormenta la autoridad <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Miren como nos hablan del paraíso <eos> Cuando nos llueven penas como granizo <eos> Miren el entusiasmo con la sentencia <eos> Sabiendo que mataban a la inocencia <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> El que oficia la muerte como un verdugo <eos> Tranquilo esta tomando su desayuno <eos> Con esto se pusieron la soga al cuello <eos> El quinto mandamiento no tiene sello <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Mientras más injusticias, señor Fiscal <eos> Más fuerza tiene mi alma para cantar <eos> Lindo segar el trigo en el sembrao <eos> Regado con tu sangre Julián Grimau <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> 
And you can bring me to my knees again <eos> All the times that I could beg you please in vain <eos> All the times that I felt insecure for you <eos> And I leave my burdens at the door <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos> All the times that I felt like this won't end, it's for you <eos> And I taste what I could never have, it was from you <eos> All the times that I've cried <eos> My intentions, full of pride <eos> But I waste more time than anyone <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos> All the times that I've cried <eos> All this wasted, it's all inside <eos> And I feel all this pain <eos> Stuffed it down, it's back again <eos> And I lie here in bed <eos> All alone, I can't mend <eos> But I feel tomorrow will be okay <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos>

Dos gardenias para ti <eos> Con ellas quiero decir <eos> Te quiero, te adoro mi vida <eos> Ponles todas tu atención <eos> Que serán tu corazón y el mío <eos> Dos gardenias para ti <eos> Que tendrán todo el calor de un beso <eos> De esos besos que te di y que jamás encontrarás <eos> En el calor del otro querer <eos> A tu lado vivirán y se hablarán <eos> Como cuando estás conmigo <eos> Y hasta creerás <eos> Que te dirán "Te quiero" <eos> Pero si un atardecer <eos> Las gardenias de mi amor se mueren <eos> Es porque han adivinado <eos> Que tu amor me ha traicionado <eos> Porque existe otro querer <eos> A tu lado vivirán y se hablarán <eos> Como cuando estás conmigo <eos> Y hasta creerás <eos> Que te dirán, "Te quiero" <eos> Pero si un atardecer <eos> Las gardenias de mi amor se mueren <eos> Es porque han adivinado <eos> Que tu amor me ha traicionado <eos> Porque existe otro querer <eos> Es porque han adivinado <eos> Que tu amor me ha traicionado <eos> Porque existe otro querer <eos> 
Blood starved machine in a feeding frenzy <eos> Don't look now, but the floor is collapsing <eos> No escape, the plummet is everlasting <eos> Sound awake in the bed I've made <eos> Pull out the pin, sanity is a grenade <eos> Dead and sound awake <eos> You could lose yourself in the absence of loss <eos> Reset and wander far away <eos> Dead and sound awake, ambitions thrown away <eos> Spirits washed away, you should know <eos> Nothing lasts forever <eos> Following footprints in circles, going snowblind <eos> Exits overgrown inside the maze of my mind <eos> Crawling out of the crypt to bleed the living dry <eos> In this fantasy, the villains win, the heroes die <eos> Slow diving to despair <eos> Fuck it, I'm done, this is a waking nightmare <eos> Blood starved machine in a feeding frenzy <eos> Dead and sound awake <eos> You could lose yourself in the absence of loss <eos> Reset and wander far away <eos> Dead and sound awake, ambitions thrown away <eos> Spirits washed away, you should know <eos> Nothing lasts forever <eos> Black moon rising <eos> Glimpse of madness <eos> Blossom black rose <eos> Withered, abandoned <eos> Sorrowed, sleepless, alone <eos> Sleepless nights, hearing voices <eos> Faint whispers expand like disease <eos> The dead are not dreaming <eos> Can't you hear them screaming? <eos> Oh <eos> This is a waking nightmare <eos> Crawling out of the crypt to bleed the living dry <eos> In this fantasy, the villains win, the heroes die <eos> Slow diving to despair <eos> Fuck it, I'm done, this is a waking nightmare <eos>

Love is a battle, at least they told me so <eos> How to surrender, sometimes I never know <eos> The walls up around me, they seem to never fall <eos> Lend me some fire so I can burn 'em all <eos> I know we've been struggling but hey, we've gotta move <eos> I can still see you now, can you see me too? <eos> Remember the rivers and how they merged our hearts <eos> Never apart <eos> 'Cause we came for morе than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for morе than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> I can feel the fear on every single breath <eos> Sometimes I feel like I can't take another step <eos> But darling, I'm a soldier <eos> I know that you're a soldier <eos> So let's climb up this mountain and get over <eos> All the things that keep us in the shadows, girl <eos> I intend to cut 'em out of both our worlds <eos> The mirror of the heart, it never lies <eos> Gotta purify our eyes and shine <eos> 'Cause we came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love (More than love, more than love) <eos> (More than love) <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love <eos> More than love <eos> We came for more than love <eos> So baby girl, don't you run <eos> We came for more than love <eos> More than love <eos>

Saw things that the rat saw <eos> And my eyes couldn't take them in <eos> Just want to fall here silently <eos> Into the arms of people I love <eos> Under waiting stars as the ships come rolling in <eos> But look at the way the faces turn <eos> Eyes burn why (eyes burn why) <eos> If you be the sky then I'll be the bird <eos> But look at the way the faces turn <eos> Eyes burn why (eyes burn why) <eos> If you be the sky then I'll be the bird <eos> So the power lines were leaning <eos> And all was lost <eos> Make a vow with the city lights <eos> With your fingers crossed <eos> You said I'd be a place and time <eos> Said I'd be a man <eos> Making eyes with a sea of lies <eos> So you understand <eos> That you're raping on my dreaming <eos> And you're ruining my best made plans <eos> The rat he turned and bared his teeth at you <eos> The wake is calling, what you gonna do? <eos> But your head's gone <eos> And it won't be long <eos> The rat he turned and bared his teeth at you <eos> The wake is calling, what you gonna do? <eos> But your head's gone <eos> And it won't be long <eos> So the sinners stopped and the villains turned <eos> And I'll be the sky and you be the bird <eos> Let's meet the mountains and see what they heard <eos> And I'll be the sky and you be the bird <eos> And I'll be the sky and you be the bird <eos>

I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> I wish you could have seen us <eos> Begging for change to get home <eos> Or at least San Francisco <eos> Let's put a ten on the high card <eos> And spend a summer on the West Coast <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos> Here's a map and a pen, the place you pointed at <eos> Be California's best <eos> All I ask, all I ask <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> I had a dream last night <eos> We drove out to see Las Vegas <eos> We lost ourselves in the bright lights <eos> Hey, please don't tell me that I'm dreaming <eos> When all I ever wanted was to <eos> Dream another sunset with you <eos> If I roll over when it's over <eos> I'll take this Cali sunrise with me <eos> And wake up with the fondest memories <eos> We made love by the ocean <eos> As the waves crashed around you (memories) <eos> Sunsets never were so bright <eos> And the skies, never so blue (memories) <eos> You opened up into my arms <eos> And we laughed as I held you (memories) <eos> I'll never go back to Georgia <eos> Not at least 'til I have to <eos> Down and to the left <eos> 
Where has it gone, that fire <eos> That from the darkn ess kept us <eos> Where all the righteous souls <eos> With flames in their eyes <eos> Yet in the end <eos> The gilded tongues <eos> Yes, in the end <eos> They burrowed in spines <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Step forward, lost seeker <eos> Read the signs of silence <eos> Come close, turn the last stone <eos> Truth lies in violence <eos> See the limbs of chilling mist <eos> Creeping these desolate halls <eos> Searching, it seems for solace <eos> For some haven <eos> From this terrible cold <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Yes, in the end, the gilded ones <eos> They were serpentine <eos> 
Warriors have gathered <eos> Our ships are sailing west <eos> Heading into war <eos> On our final quest <eos> For weeks we will travel <eos> Through the wind and rain <eos> Guided by the stars <eos> As we drink away our pain <eos> Leaving all behind <eos> Nothing left to lose <eos> Where our long boats meet the shores <eos> We're nothing but bad news <eos> Gales of mighty fury <eos> For fortune and for glory <eos> Through the water and waves <eos> Born out of night and nails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Mighty with mythical powers <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> He is the wind in our sails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Now your riches are ours <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Mothered by the night <eos> His senses sharp and keen <eos> Shaper of the greatest winds <eos> A Viking's ever seen <eos> The moonlit sea, the raging storm <eos> His will and his domain <eos> Bend the sea, oh God of waves <eos> And guide us through the wind and rain <eos> Gales of mighty fury <eos> For fortune and for glory <eos> Through the wind and rain <eos> Born out of night and nails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Mighty with mythical powers <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> He is the wind in our sails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Now your riches are ours <eos> He is the crushing force of the waves <eos> The awesome power of winds <eos> Guides us to wealth of coin <eos> And brings death upon those untrue <eos> Born out of night and nails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Mighty with mythical powers <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> He is the wind in our sails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Now your riches are ours <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Born out of night and nails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Mighty with mythical powers <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> He is the wind in our sails <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> Now your riches are ours <eos> (Hail Njord) <eos> 
Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> I find myself growing in an environment <eos> Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent <eos> In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations <eos> I've seen where some have died in desperation <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto) <eos> Hustling is the only education I know <eos> Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle <eos> A situation like this is getting too hard to handle <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> With a pregnant woman, yes <eos> And five kids to care for <eos> Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town <eos> As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me <eos> I pray the day will come when I shall be free from <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh, live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury <eos> Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy <eos> Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon <eos> I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Now a fugitive at large <eos> Could this be my destiny? <eos> With no one to care for the wellfare of my family <eos> In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure <eos> For mind and soul would soon be weary <eos> Just couldn't take no more <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song <eos> 
Been there, done that, messed around <eos> I’m having fun, don’t put me down <eos> I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet <eos> I won’t let you in again <eos> The messages I’ve tried to send <eos> My information’s just not going in <eos> Burning bridges shore to shore <eos> I break away from something more <eos> I’m not turned on to love until it’s cheap <eos> Been there, done that, messed around <eos> I’m having fun, don’t put me down <eos> I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> I won’t let you turn around <eos> And tell me now I’m much too proud <eos> To walk away from something when it’s dead <eos> Do-do-do your dirty words <eos> Come out to play when you are hurt? <eos> There’s certain things that should be left unsaid <eos> Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch <eos> And life’s too short for me to stop <eos> Oh, baby, your time is running out <eos> I won’t let you turn around <eos> And tell me now I’m much too proud <eos> All you do is fill me up with doubt <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> (This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time) <eos> This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof <eos> (This time, baby, this time, baby, this time, baby, this time) <eos>

Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> It's not love I'm running from <eos> It's the heartbreak I know will come <eos> 'Cause I know you're no good for me <eos> But you've become a part of me <eos> Everywhere I go, your face I see <eos> Every step I take you take with me <eos> Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> I know you're no good for me but free of you I'll never be, no <eos> Each night as I sleep into my heart you creep <eos> I wake up feeling sorry I met you hoping soon that I'll forget you <eos> When I look in the mirror to comb my hair <eos> I see your face just a smilin' there <eos> Nowhere to run, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> I know you're no good for me but you've become a part of me <eos> How can I fight a love that shouldn't be? <eos> When it's so deep, so deep, deep inside of me <eos> My love reaches so high I can't get over it <eos> It's so wide I can't get around it, no <eos> Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide from you baby <eos> Just can't get away from you baby, no matter how I try <eos> I know you're no good for me but free of you I'll never be <eos> Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> Got nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide <eos> 
I move along <eos> Something's wrong <eos> I guess a part of me is gone <eos> Skies are gray <eos> Start to fade <eos> I guess I threw it all away <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Tired soul <eos> Dying hope <eos> I guess I'm running out of road <eos> I guess I've got nowhere <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> Feels like I'm dying <eos> Feels like I'm lying to myself <eos> I know that I'm trying <eos> But it feels like I'm in Hell <eos> I'm in Hell <eos> Sometimes I just want to quit <eos> Tell my life I'm done with it <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> Sometimes I just want to say <eos> I love myself but not today <eos> When it feels too painful <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> I smash my broken heart of gold <eos> 
Down around the corner <eos> Half a mile from here <eos> You see them long trains runnin' <eos> And you watch 'em disappear <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> You know I saw Miss Lucy <eos> Down along the tracks <eos> She lost her home and her family <eos> And she won't be coming back <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now-na-na-now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, the Illinois Central <eos> And the Southern Central Freight <eos> Got to keep on pushin', mama <eos> 'Cause you know they're runnin' late <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be now? <eos> Without love <eos> Well, pistons keep on churnin' <eos> And the wheels go 'round and 'round <eos> And the steel rails lie cold and hard <eos> On the mountains they go down <eos> Without love <eos> Where would you be right now? <eos> Without love <eos> Ooh, where would you be now? <eos> Mmm, got to get you, baby baby, won't you move it down? <eos> Won't you move it down? <eos> Baby, baby, baby, baby, won't you move it down? <eos> When the big train run <eos> When the train is movin' on <eos> I got to keep on movin' <eos> Keep on movin' <eos> Won't you keep on movin'? <eos> Gonna keep on movin' <eos> 
Why should I have to beg for what is rightfully mine? <eos> While you sit back and wait for a comet to pass you by <eos> And you hold out your hands, in hopes that a future will fall right out of the sky <eos> But you will only find dread, as months turn to years fading out into hindsight <eos> Now I watch as the world unwinds <eos> And I bathe in the moonlight <eos> Where do I go from here? <eos> A roadmap of my passing prime <eos> Full of holes, it erodes, with my soul, and I’m bleeding <eos> I’ve been told that it’s all just prologue <eos> The afterlife is waiting for me <eos> But how do you know? <eos> When my fate has been on hold for so long <eos> I grow old, the window starts to close, and I can’t… <eos> Breathe, breathe in and fulfill your purpose <eos> Reduce the trees to a pile of leaves <eos> Burn them all to ash ’til you’re choking on the answer <eos> Though you may never be… <eos> Free, free from the disease that ails us <eos> Beyond the plague of uncertainty, waits the essence of my new reality <eos> With each and every trial, I learned how to be strong <eos> Endow my spirit with the strength to carry on <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> Knowledge of death brings us life <eos> Aging like a fine wine <eos> Until the well has run dry <eos> Marking the passage of time <eos> Need for expression comes in succession <eos> I’m here to take what is mine <eos> Nothing to hold me back if I don’t feel alive <eos> And now the planets align <eos> Drive all my focus into this moment <eos> Something’s in the water <eos> Just like any monster, it grows, and it grows tenfold <eos> The frozen ocean is brought to a boil <eos> Praying at the altar <eos> Just doesn’t compare to getting your own hands dirty <eos> Reality is a tangible thing <eos> I retrace all my footprints back to when I was young <eos> Until I find the message I’ve kept buried for so long <eos> I want it all at once or, I want it not at all <eos> A truth that leads me to the place where I belong <eos> This is where I belong <eos> And in my fever dream <eos> Nothing is as it seems <eos> So ever-carefully I will roam <eos> Choices I never made <eos> Outcomes that I can’t change <eos> Let go of shame, and carry on <eos> I still carry the spark <eos> It guides me through the dark <eos> So in the frigid pain, I will roam <eos> With burdens in my arms <eos> I’m dreaming of a star <eos> Feels like a fantasy <eos> I’m not asleep <eos> 
Sister cries out, from her baby bed <eos> Brother runs in, feathers on his head <eos> Mama's in her room learnin' how to sew <eos> Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio <eos> Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap <eos> Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope <eos> Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound <eos> Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town <eos> Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone" <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> The South moves north, North moves south <eos> A star is born, a star burns out <eos> The only thing that stays the same is <eos> Everything changes, everything changes <eos> Sister calls herself a sexy grandma <eos> Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol <eos> Mama's out of touch with reality <eos> Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree <eos> As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> 
I've been taking my time for a long time <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> Speaking English as a foreign language <eos> Any words that I haven't forgot <eos> I've been thinking how I can't be bothered <eos> To wash the dishes or remake the bed <eos> What's the point when I could doss instead? <eos> I've been hanging out with various riff-raff <eos> Somewhere on the Goldhawk road <eos> I don't think it's gonna be much longer <eos> 'Til I'm mugging up on the penal code <eos> Love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> Like all their aspirations, it's a fantasy <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> You made me see reality <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> It's a blatant fallacy <eos> You won't see me with a bunch of roses <eos> Promising fidelity <eos> Love doesn't mean a thing to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> While the bankers all get their bonuses <eos> I'll just get along with what I've got <eos> Watching the weeds in the garden <eos> Putting my feet up a lot <eos> I'll explore the outer limits of boredom <eos> Moaning periodically <eos> Just a full-time lonely layabout, that's me <eos> When you walked out you did me a favour <eos> It's absolutely clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> Just like they said at university <eos> I'll be taking my time for a long time <eos> With all the schadenfreude it's cost <eos> Calculating what you've lost <eos> Now I'm digging through my student paperbacks <eos> Flicking through Karl Marx again <eos> Searching for the soul of England <eos> Drinking tea like Tony Benn <eos> Love is just a bourgeois construct <eos> So I'm giving up the bourgeoisie <eos> Until you come back to me <eos> Talking tough and feeling bitter <eos> But better now it's clear to me <eos> That love is a bourgeois construct <eos> So I've given up the bourgeoisie <eos> 
Christmas night, another fight <eos> Tears, we cried a flood <eos> Got all kinds of poison in <eos> Of poison in my blood <eos> I took my feet <eos> To Oxford Street <eos> Trying to right a wrong <eos> Just walk away <eos> Those windows say <eos> But I can't believe she's gone <eos> When you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Up above candles on air flicker <eos> Oh, they flicker and they float <eos> But I'm up here holding on <eos> To all those chandeliers of hope <eos> Like some drunken Elvis singing <eos> I go singing out of tune <eos> Saying how I always loved you darling <eos> And I always will <eos> Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Still waiting for the snow to fall <eos> It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Down where the sea and city meet <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Those Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Maybe they'll bring her back to me <eos> Then all my troubles will be gone <eos> Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos> Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> Oh, Christmas lights <eos> Light up the street <eos> Light up the fireworks in me <eos> May all your troubles soon be gone <eos> Those Christmas lights, keep shining on <eos>

I don't need you to love me, I can't be broken twice <eos> Just tell me I'm beautiful as we lie down, that will suffice <eos> Don't look so guilty as though you've done me wrong <eos> I'm not your victim to be pitied <eos> I'm not yours at all for long <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Ahh Ahhh <eos> But you kissed me too softly and then I felt used <eos> You told me I was there, your call to arms your muse <eos> Don't act so bewitched as though you tried to stay true <eos> Did I enchant you with my voice, was it my hair that maddened you? <eos> Such excuses are heard only in songs <eos> From a time before you and I <eos> There is no great romance here, no <eos> Just a lust you tried to glorify <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> Oooh ooh ooh <eos> I'll never let you hurt me, I'll never let you in <eos> A fool was I to indulge in such sordid dealings <eos> I won't let this bruise me, the choice is my own <eos> Not to let another use me and learn to be alone <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> 
Yelling at the sky <eos> Screaming at the world <eos> Baby, why'd you go away? <eos> I’m still your girl <eos> Holding on too tight <eos> Head up in the clouds <eos> Heaven only knows where you are now <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Never got the chance <eos> To say your last goodbye <eos> I gotta move on <eos> But it hurts to try <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I’m alright <eos> Baby, you’re just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I’m dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> 
Oh! <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> Way too many heads, need a steady view <eos> Smokin' cigarettes at the rendezvous <eos> Never meant to cross you <eos> But my jaw hit the floor with the one, two <eos> Think I want you <eos> You say this ain't love, but it's still the same love <eos> Make love, anything to sate ya <eos> Don't be shy, you decide <eos> Say, can I make you mine? <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (If you say it's alright) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie <eos> His love never felt right <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Don't lie, baby don't lie) <eos> (Ah) Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine (Ah) <eos> Your skin, so fine (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> Come close, baby, put it on mine <eos> It's just you and I, and no other guys <eos> We got no interruptions and we both feelin' the vibe <eos> Say I'm not your type, but I know what's on your mind <eos> We can talk about nothin' or we can see what it's like <eos> No, oh, oh <eos> Don't lie, baby, don't lie (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> His love never felt right (Ah) <eos> Switch sides and I'm beside you <eos> If you say it's alright (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> (Let me show you how it feel like) <eos> (Don't lie, baby, don't lie) <eos> 
Lying in my bed <eos> I hear the clock tick, and think of you <eos> Caught up in circles <eos> Confusion is nothing new <eos> Flashback, warm nights <eos> Almost left behind <eos> Suitcase of memories <eos> Time after— <eos> Sometimes, you picture me <eos> I'm walking too far ahead <eos> You're calling to me <eos> I can't hear what you've said <eos> Then you say, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> After my picture fades <eos> And darkness has turned to gray <eos> Watching through windows <eos> You're wondering if I'm okay <eos> Secrets stolen from deep inside <eos> The drum beats out of time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> You said, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> 
Oh, to see without my eyes <eos> The first time that you kissed me <eos> Boundless by the time I cried <eos> I built your walls around me <eos> White noise, what an awful sound <eos> Fumbling by Rogue River <eos> Feel my feet above the ground <eos> Hand of God, deliver me <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The first time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> Lord, I no longer believe <eos> Drowned in living waters <eos> Cursed by the love that I received <eos> From my brother's daughter <eos> Like Hephaestion, who died <eos> Alexander's lover <eos> Now my riverbed has dried <eos> Shall I find no other? <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> I'm running like a plover <eos> Now I'm prone to misery <eos> The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me <eos> How much sorrow can I take? <eos> Blackbird on my shoulder <eos> And what difference does it make <eos> When this love is over? <eos> Shall I sleep within your bed? <eos> River of unhappiness <eos> Hold your hands upon my head <eos> Till I breathe my last breath <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The last time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> 
Some kids have and some don't <eos> And some of us are wondering why <eos> Mom won't watch the news at night <eos> There's too much stuff that's making her cry <eos> We need some help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> A house, a yard <eos> A neighbourhood <eos> Where you can ride your new bike to school <eos> A kind of world where Mom and Dad <eos> Still believe in the golden rule <eos> Life's not that simple <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice, one simple word <eos> Hearts know what to say <eos> One dream can change the world <eos> Keep believing <eos> Till you find a way <eos> Yesterday, while walking home <eos> I saw a kid on Newberry Road <eos> He pulled a pistol from his bag <eos> And tossed it in the river below <eos> Thanks for the help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> 
Por las noches la miro <eos> En un negro vestido <eos> Con tacones tan altos, que hacen que camine tan lindo <eos> Su sonrisa tan tierna <eos> Sus ojitos de perlas <eos> Y la luz de la luna, se refleja en su piel de seda <eos> En su piel de seda <eos> Y al tomarle la mano <eos> Beso sus dulces labios <eos> Me pierdo en su mirada, no hay palabras que puedan explicarlo <eos> Su sonrisa tan tierna <eos> Sus ojitos de perlas <eos> Y la luz de la luna, se refleja en su piel de seda <eos> En su piel de seda <eos> Alguna vez has visto <eos> Al sol cobijarse con las olas del mar <eos> La noche vino <eos> Comienzo este sueño y no pienso despertar <eos> Oh no, oh no no <eos> No oh no <eos> 
I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> 
They read you Cinderella <eos> You hoped it would come true <eos> And one day your Prince Charming <eos> Would come rescue you <eos> You like romantic movies <eos> And you never will forget <eos> The way you felt when Romeo <eos> Kissed Juliet <eos> And all this time that you've been waiting <eos> You don't have to wait no more <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I never make a promise <eos> I don't intend to keep <eos> So when I say forever <eos> Forever's what I mean <eos> Well I'm no Cassanova <eos> But I swear this much is true <eos> I'll be holding nothing back <eos> When it comes to you <eos> You dream of love that's everlasting <eos> Well baby open up your eyes <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> If you want tenderness <eos> I got tenderness <eos> And I see through <eos> To the heart of you <eos> If you want a man <eos> Who will understand <eos> You don't have to look very far <eos> I can love you <eos> Girl, I can love you <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can, I can love you <eos> Always kiss and hug you <eos> Baby be mine <eos> My one and only girl <eos> My heart <eos> My world <eos> You're everything to me <eos> I can, I can love you <eos> If you let me love you <eos> My one girl <eos> 
All the time I’ve had to grow <eos> From the valleys, left alone <eos> Said I had to let you go <eos> To read the writing on the wall <eos> Born and raised in <eos> California <eos> Skies were blue <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> Lost in every place I go <eos> But leaving footprints on the road <eos> Won’t be long before you know <eos> Nothing matters anymore <eos> Born and raisеd in <eos> California <eos> Skies were bluе <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> 
When dreaming I'm guided to another world <eos> Time and time again <eos> At sunrise I fight to stay asleep <eos> Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place <eos> Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape <eos> From the life I live when I'm awake <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Although I would like our world to change <eos> It helps me to appreciate <eos> Those nights and those dreams <eos> But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights <eos> If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same <eos> The only difference is <eos> To let love replace all our hate <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> So let's go there <eos> Let's make our escape <eos> Come on, let's go there <eos> Let's ask, "Can we stay?" <eos> Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place where blind men see <eos> Can you take me higher? <eos> To a place with golden streets <eos> 
I heard the bells on Christmas day <eos> Their old familiar carols play <eos> And wild and sweet the words repeat <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> I thought how, as the day had come <eos> The belfries of all Christendom <eos> Had rolled along the unbroken song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men <eos> And in despair I bowed my head: <eos> “There is no peace on earth, ” I said <eos> “For hate is strong and mocks the song <eos> Of peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos> Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: <eos> “God is not dead, nor does he sleep; <eos> The wrong shall fail, the right prevail <eos> With peace on earth, good will to men.” <eos> 
I bet you thought your life would change <eos> But you're sat on a train again <eos> Your memories are sceneries for things you said <eos> But never really meant <eos> You build it to a high to say goodbye <eos> Because you're not the same as them <eos> But your death it won't happen to you <eos> It happens to your family and your friends <eos> I pretend <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> You win, you lose, you sing the blues <eos> There's no point in buying concrete shoes <eos> I'll refuse <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die <eos> Am I me through geography? <eos> A face collapsed through entropy <eos> I can hardly speak <eos> And when I try it's nothing but a squeak <eos> On the video <eos> Living room for small <eos> If you can't survive, just try <eos> And I always wanna die, sometimes <eos> I always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> And I always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die, sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> I, sometimes, always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die <eos> Always wanna die, sometimes <eos> 
Uno nace mientras el planeta gira <eos> Los pulmones abren, la nariz respira <eos> Escuchamos al mundo con todo su alboroto <eos> Los párpados suben y los ojos tiran fotos <eos> Si salimos de la cuna para dormir en la cama <eos> Nos crecen los brazos como crecen las ramas <eos> Como crecen las hojas nos crecen las manos <eos> Como crecen los días cuando madruga temprano <eos> Los segundos, los minutos y las horas germinan <eos> Así como los días empiezan y terminan <eos> Los meses se disfrazan según el meridiano <eos> Otoño, invierno, primavera, verano <eos> Y se ajusta el camino a nuestros pasos <eos> Así como el agua se adapta a su vaso <eos> Nuestro corazón se aclimata a la altura <eos> Y nos adaptamos a cualquier aventura <eos> Pueden sumar con prisa, pueden restar con calma <eos> Da igual porque las matemáticas no tienen alma <eos> Aunque calculemos todo y le pongamos nombre propio <eos> Nuestro espíritu no lo pueden ver los microscopios <eos> Nadie se puede acobardar <eos> Nacimos siendo valientes porque respirar es arriesgar <eos> Este es el momento de agarrar el impulso <eos> Las emociones las narra nuestro pulso <eos> Respira el momento <eos> Respira el momento <eos> En nuestra galaxia la historia se expande <eos> Desde lo más simple hasta lo más grande <eos> Crecimos junto a los cuerpos celestes <eos> Somos el norte, sur, este y oeste <eos> Somos la tierra con todas sus huellas <eos> Una supernova entre todas las estrellas <eos> Absorbemos la luz de los rayos <eos> Mientras la clorofila navega por los tallos <eos> Los grados y centígrados calientan los termómetros <eos> A 150 millones de kilómetros <eos> Hay una vía láctea repleta de neuronas <eos> Porque reproducimos más ideas que personas <eos> No somos pequeños, ni muy grandes tampoco <eos> Somos muchos y también somos pocos <eos> Somos el golpe cuando aterriza <eos> Y también somos la piel cuando cicatriza <eos> La muerte nunca nos venció <eos> Porque todo lo que muere es por que alguna vez nació <eos> Respira el momento <eos> Respira el momento <eos> En nuestra galaxia la historia se expande <eos> Desde lo más simple hasta lo más grande <eos> Lengua, beso, boca, labio <eos> Niño, joven, viejo, sabio <eos> Calvo, rizo, pelo lacio <eos> Techo, casa, cielo, espacio <eos> Sexo, orgasmo se humedece <eos> Quizás, nunca, siempre, a veces <eos> Libro, letra, cuento, narra <eos> Ron con hielo, trago, barra <eos> Tres millones de latidos en un periodo mensual <eos> Caminamos dando 10 mil pasos en un día normal <eos> Crudo, hervido, asado, frito <eos> Guerra, iglesia, rezo, grito <eos> Muy poquito, demasiado <eos> Corro, vuelo, salto, nado <eos> Puede llegar algún día el colmo de la biología <eos> Vivir con sangre caliente pa' morir a sangre fría <eos> Respira el momento <eos> Respira el momento <eos> En nuestra galaxia la historia se expande <eos> Desde lo más simple hasta lo más grande <eos> Respira el momento <eos> Respira el momento <eos> En nuestra galaxia la historia se expande <eos> Desde lo más simple hasta lo más grande <eos>

It's Christmas time <eos> There's no need to be afraid <eos> At Christmas time <eos> We let in light and we banish shade <eos> And in our world of plenty <eos> We can spread a smile of joy <eos> Throw your arms around the world <eos> At Christmas time <eos> But say a prayer <eos> Pray for the other ones <eos> At Christmas time it's hard <eos> But when you're having fun <eos> n <eos> There's a world outside your window <eos> And it's a world of dread and fear <eos> Where the only water flowing <eos> Is the bitter sting of tears <eos> And the Christmas bells that ring there <eos> Are the clanging chimes of doom <eos> Well tonight thank God it's them <eos> Instead of you <eos> And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time <eos> The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh) <eos> Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow <eos> Do they know it's Christmas time at all? <eos> Here's to you <eos> Raise a glass for everyone <eos> Here's to them <eos> Underneath that burning sun <eos> Do they know it's Christmas time at all? <eos> Feed the world <eos> Feed the world <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> 
Ya van a empezar las fiestas <eos> Las fiestas de navidad <eos> Y el jíbarito cantando <eos> A todos nos va alegrar <eos> Vamos a que no recuerdan <eos> El más remoto rincón <eos> Se escucha al jibarito <eos> Cantando su inspiración <eos> Felicitarles ahora queremos <eos> Con tono de devoción <eos> Le deseamos feliz año <eos> La orquesta de Willie Colón <eos> Se acerca la navidad, y a todos nos va a alegrar <eos> El jibarito cantando aires de felicidad <eos> Lo lai le lo lé, lo lai le lo lá <eos> Aunque usted no quiera le vengo a cantar <eos> Y a felicitar con voz de alegría <eos> Yo traigo armonía a su santo hogar <eos> Que yo traigo armonía a su santo hogar <eos> Se acerca la navidad, y a todos nos va a alegrar <eos> El jibarito cantando aires de felicidad <eos> Un veinticinco nació... <eos> Y fue en el mes de diciembre <eos> Que en un humilde pesebre <eos> La luz del mundo llegó <eos> Y con esta me despido <eos> Como esto es devoción <eos> Que pasen un feliz año <eos> Les deseo de corazón <eos> Asalto de navidad... <eos> 
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love <eos> Even more than I usually do <eos> And although I know it's a long road back <eos> I promise you <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please have snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents by the tree <eos> Christmas eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in my dreams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please have some snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents by the tree <eos> 
I used to think that I deserved this <eos> Tried my best but never perfect <eos> I was helpless, and you know it <eos> You like to think you're a martyr, but you're just abusive, so now <eos> I'm not afraid to admit that there's nothing left <eos> I know you try to manipulate me again <eos> But I've come to grips with the fact that what's dead is dead <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would'vе never let you in <eos> Yеah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> All the years spent with a vermin <eos> Left me soul-sick, always searching <eos> I learned that trust is really worth it <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> This is cut ties, no goodbye, nail in the coffin <eos> This is the nail in the coffin <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> You were never being honest <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> Blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me <eos> I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream) <eos> Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why <eos> Without you, it's hard to survive <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky <eos> They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry) <eos> The good and the bad times, we've been through them all <eos> You make me rise when I fall <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 
I'll have a blue Christmas without you <eos> I'll be so blue just thinking about you <eos> You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white <eos> But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas <eos> Come on <eos> I'll have a blue Christmas without you <eos> I'll be so blue thinking about you <eos> Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree <eos> Won't be the same, my dear, if you're not here with me <eos> And when those blue snowflakes start falling <eos> That's when those blue memories start calling <eos> You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white <eos> But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Ooh, let me hear ya! <eos> Ha ha ha! <eos> Hey <eos> When those blue snowflakes start falling <eos> That's when those blue memories start calling <eos> Oh, you'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white <eos> But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas <eos> Oh, yes I will <eos> I'll have a blue, blue Christmas <eos> Hey, hey yeah <eos> Oh, let me hear you sing it with me <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> I'll have a blue, blue Christmas <eos> Hey, oh yeah <eos> Yes I will <eos> Look what you do to me, baby <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> Do do do, mmm, mmm, mmm <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> I'll have a blue, blue Christmas <eos> 
Peace is not a silent state <eos> That comes upon us from within— <eos> Serene, detached, oblivious <eos> Peace is not a force like rain <eos> That comes, unbidden, from above— <eos> Gentle, enfolding, natural <eos> Peace is fire! Yes, peace is fire! <eos> And peace is passion! <eos> Peace requires a strength of will <eos> A certain courage, a heart of iron <eos> A force abiding to fulfill <eos> Peace is not a foregone fate; <eos> For peace, like war, must be waged— <eos> Mindfully, deliberately <eos> With arms ever ready <eos> And eyes wide open <eos> 
Tengo ganas de tenerte siempre <eos> De conocerte una y mil veces <eos> Tengo ganas que todos se enteren <eos> Si existe la suerte, la mía es quererte <eos> Si te falta vida yo te la daría <eos> Si un día tú me faltas, yo no sé qué haría <eos> Porque eres el principio y el final <eos> Eres tú, sólo tú <eos> Que importa el mundo entero <eos> Si lo único que quiero <eos> Eres tú <eos> Tengo ganas de que no me sueltes <eos> Que lentamente el tiempo vuele <eos> Yo me muero por amanecerte <eos> Que un beso llegue como el Sol y te despierte <eos> Si te falta vida yo te la daría <eos> Si un día tú me faltas, yo no sé qué haría <eos> Porque eres el principio y el final <eos> Eres tú, sólo tú <eos> Que importa el mundo entero <eos> Si lo único que quiero <eos> Eres tú <eos> No, no <eos> Sólo tú <eos> Eres tú, sólo tú <eos> Lo que quiero eres sólo tú <eos> No me importa nada el mundo entero <eos> Eres tú <eos> Eres tú <eos> Eres tú <eos> Sólo tú <eos> No me importa nada el mundo entero <eos> Eres tú <eos> Eres tú <eos> Eres tú <eos> No, no <eos> 
Maybe it's nice to be alone in the end <eos> You know I'm fine living so close to the edge <eos> Who needs a house when I've got all these friends? <eos> They say: "Are you gonna give up some day?" <eos> "Are you gonna grow up some day?" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Don't need a license when you've got no drive <eos> It feels so right taking the wrong advice <eos> They tell me one day that I'll pay the price <eos> They saying: "Maybe I'll go up in flames" <eos> "Maybe it'll blow up one day" <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> I know we're getting older but that don't mean it's over <eos> Ooh <eos> I know we're getting sober but that's not on my mind <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live this way every day <eos> We can do this every night <eos> You can be my ride or die <eos> And we can live this way every day <eos> Go out like dynamite, I'm living life, ride or die <eos> Gonna live my life, live my life <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos> Live, life, live, ride or die <eos>

If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> Now we could talk all night <eos> About the weather <eos> Could tell you about my friends <eos> Out on the coast <eos> I could ask a lot of crazy questions <eos> Or ask you what I really wanna know <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> Now rain can fall so soft <eos> Against the window <eos> Sun can shine so bright <eos> Up in the sky <eos> But Daddy always told me <eos> "Don't make small talk" <eos> He said, "Come on out and say <eos> What's on your mind" <eos> So if I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> If I was dying of thirst <eos> Would your flowing love come quench me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I said you have a beautiful body <eos> Would you hold it against me? <eos> If I swore you were an angel <eos> Would you treat me like the devil tonight? <eos> 
Psychotic lover, what's left of us <eos> No one denied this, such foolish costs <eos> Self pity's always sad <eos> This city's fully flattened <eos> Red city might exist <eos> Just getting sick <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> Now and 'til the end <eos> Hypnotic travelers, drift until lost <eos> No sign of Earth now, just endless stars <eos> So set the night new <eos> What silly house is this? <eos> Not sad I left you <eos> Just getting sick <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> Step in, stupid, nothing, I can't <eos> Get in, get in, let go, let go <eos> Step in <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> I'm on my way to Mars <eos> Mars, Mars <eos> Mars, Mars <eos> Mars, get going <eos>

Hey <eos> This is a story I hate <eos> And tellin' it might make me break <eos> But I'll tell it anyway <eos> This chapter's about <eos> How you said there was nobody else <eos> Then you got up and went to her house <eos> You guys always left me out <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart? <eos> You check in and out <eos> Of my heart like a hotel <eos> And she must be perfect, oh well <eos> I hope you both go to hell <eos> I still have the letter you wrote when you told me <eos> That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life <eos> I guess my friends were right <eos> Each day goes by and each night, I cry <eos> Somebody saw you with her last night <eos> You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her" <eos> You might love her now, but you loved me first <eos> Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are <eos> Oh, you swore on every star <eos> How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart) <eos> How could you be so reckless? <eos> How could you be so reckless? <eos> How could you be so reckless with someone's heart? <eos> Hey <eos> This is a story I hate <eos> But I told it to cope with the pain <eos> I'm so sorry if you can relate <eos>

Life's like a road that you travel on <eos> When there's one day here and the next day gone <eos> Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand <eos> Sometimes you turn your back to the wind <eos> There's a world outside every darkened door <eos> Where blues won't haunt you anymore <eos> Where the brave are free and lovers soar <eos> Come ride with me to the distant shore <eos> We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate <eos> There's not much time left today <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> Through all the cities and all these towns <eos> It's in my blood and it's all around <eos> I love you now like I loved you then <eos> This is the road and these are the hills <eos> From Mozambique to those Memphis nights <eos> The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights <eos> Knock me down, get back up again <eos> You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man <eos> There's no load I can't hold <eos> The roads are rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, hmm <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> There was a distance between you and I <eos> A misunderstanding once <eos> But now we look it in the eye <eos> Oh <eos> There ain't no load that I can't hold <eos> Road so rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell 'em we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah yeah yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long, ooh <eos> (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme yeah) <eos>

See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own <eos> Business as I kick up the treble tone <eos> On my radio tape player box, right <eos> Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? <eos> Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin' <eos> Investigation maybe she was demonstratin' <eos> But nevertheless I was pleased <eos> My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease <eos> Until a group of brothers started buggin' out <eos> Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route <eos> Disrespectin' my black queen <eos> Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene <eos> At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type <eos> They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight <eos> And they see a young couple having a time that's good <eos> And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood <eos> So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do <eos> And the loud bright colors that I wear (boom!) <eos> I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit <eos> And the outfit that I'm wearin' brothers dissin' it <eos> Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be <eos> But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy <eos> Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me? <eos> 'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me, see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> I told the niggas please let us pass, friend <eos> I said please 'cause I don't like killin' Africans <eos> But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube <eos> But I had to take the brother out for being rude <eos> And like I said before I was mad by then <eos> It took three or four cops to pull me off of him <eos> But that's the story y'all of a black man <eos> Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African <eos> You see <eos> I am everyday people <eos> You see, I am everyday people <eos> The moral of the story is <eos> You better look very hard at who you're steppin' to <eos> 'Cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it <eos> Africans need to be lovin' each other and unite <eos>

Mente positiva y ay, qué cosas de la vida <eos> Si hablo de animales me gusta más gorilita <eos> Tengo quien me cuide, también quien quiere matarme <eos> Pero no me escondo, ya saben dónde encontrarme <eos> Las morras me gustan, son lo mejor de la vida <eos> Me gustan las güeritas, también las morenitas <eos> Pero que estén locas pa' tirar bien el desmadre <eos> Que si saco un cuerno ellas también quieran jalarle <eos> Que si la muerte <eos> Que si el dinero que hay corretiar billete <eos> Ya no hay pendiente <eos> Que buenas noches <eos> Unas botellas y que tiren buena trampa <eos> Se me destrampa <eos> Aquí andamos bien a gusto, no voy a parar <eos> Polvo, mujeres y amigos, me gusta rolar <eos> Y ahí le va, compa, socito <eos> Hasta Tijuana viejo, puro Junior H <eos> Quemando llantita, que bien quema la sierrita <eos> Ya prendió las luces, atrás viene un policia <eos> No soy hocicón ni me gusta tirar charola <eos> Mejor no me paro y si me alcanza pago cuota <eos> El que es aventado y tiene huevos en la vida <eos> Siempre trae dinero y pide ayudar su familia <eos> Siempre trae buen carro pa' levantar buenas morras <eos> Y al que se atraviesa le hacemos volar la gorra <eos> Que si la muerte <eos> Que si el dinero que hay corretiar billete <eos> Ya no hay pendiente <eos> Que buenas noches <eos> Unas botellas y que tiren buena trampa <eos> Se me destrampa <eos> Aquí andamos bien a gusto, no voy a parar <eos> Polvo, mujeres y amigos, me gusta rolar <eos>

You had me asking myself <eos> What if it never ended? <eos> Don't mean to get ahead of myself <eos> But what if we just pretended? <eos> We could stay right here <eos> Freeze frame 'til next year <eos> I can just picture it now <eos> Still riding around <eos> Ragtop Jeep with the windows down <eos> Cranking pop songs while we roll through town <eos> Sun kissing us, we were kissing each other <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Bright blue sky shining just for us <eos> Might've just been July, but it felt like love <eos> End of each night praying for another <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Stuck in eighteen <eos> Yelling "Young forever" <eos> Just a teenage dream <eos> Running from September <eos> Got a good thing here <eos> Please don't disappear <eos> I can just picture it now <eos> Still riding around <eos> Ragtop Jeep with the windows down <eos> Cranking pop songs while we roll through town <eos> Sun kissing us, we were kissing each other <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Bright blue sky shining just for us <eos> Might've just been July, but it felt like love <eos> End of each night praying for another <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> We could stay right here <eos> Freeze frame 'til next year <eos> Ragtop Jeep with the windows down <eos> Cranking pop songs while we roll through town <eos> Sun kissing us, we were kissing each other <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Bright blue sky shining just for us <eos> Might've just been July, but it felt like love <eos> End of each night praying for another <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Ragtop Jeep with the windows down <eos> Cranking pop songs while we roll through town <eos> Sun kissing us, we were kissing each other <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> Bright blue sky shining just for us <eos> Might've just been July, but it felt like love <eos> End of each night praying for another <eos> Yeah, love for the summer <eos> 
Have you ever felt like you just couldn't be yourself <eos> Like it'd be easier if you were someone else <eos> Is there a voice inside your mind <eos> That reminds you all the time <eos> The ways you're broken <eos> Has it left you hopeless? <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never be enough <eos> Has anybody told you that you'd never measure up <eos> Are you just trying to escape? <eos> Trying to run from all the pain <eos> Of being human <eos> Can you make it through it? <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> It can be a hard, hard thing just being alive <eos> It can be a dark, dark thing when you're trying to hide <eos> Every story, every scar <eos> You are loved the way you are <eos> There's nothing you need to prove <eos> 'Cause heaven knows your name <eos> There's a reason you were made <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> You, you, you <eos> Fearfully and wonderfully you <eos> Don't give up <eos> Don't give up <eos> He's not giving up on you <eos> Not giving up on you <eos> 
You've got me stressed out <eos> I lied to my friends <eos> Yeah, when we hung out <eos> I broke promises <eos> Because I told them <eos> That I would never see you again, but then I saw you again <eos> Backwards and forwards and forwards and backwards <eos> I can't keep on falling back into your patterns <eos> You got me in your web, black widow in the bed <eos> Up and then down and side to side <eos> You cut me like you cut your lights <eos> I barely survived last time <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> Might overdose if <eos> We do this again <eos> Should be precocious <eos> But damn it I'm in deeper than I can <eos> Swim but here I am again, drowning in sin <eos> Backwards and forwards and forwards and backwards <eos> I can't keep on falling back into your patterns <eos> You got me in your web, black widow in the bed <eos> Up and then down and side to side <eos> You cut me like you cut your lights <eos> I barely survived last time <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> My friends say, they think you're so dangerous <eos> Devil in a dress, my god, you're so shameless <eos> My friends say, they think you're so dangerous <eos> Devil in a dress, my god, you're so shameless <eos> Almost died that night in the back of the tub <eos> You're my best drug and I'm addicted <eos> Death's kiss, red lips <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> Losing my head <eos> This is the end <eos> God, am I dead? <eos> You make my life flash right before my eyes <eos> So good to me, so bad every time <eos> Death's kiss, red lips push me over the edge <eos> I'm losing my head <eos> I think I need rehab, rehab <eos> And it's bad <eos> I'm relapsing, she's back <eos> I need rehab <eos> 
Pasa y siéntate, tranquilízate <eos> Al fin ya estás aquí, ¿qué más te da? <eos> Imagínate que yo no soy yo <eos> Que soy el otro hombre que esperabas ver <eos> Un desconocido que te ha escrito un verso <eos> Y te dibujó la Luna en un trozo de papel <eos> Un amante improvisado, misterioso, apasionado <eos> Que te dio una cita en este hotel <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Y es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero te dejo y me marcho, para siempre <eos> Imagínate, que yo no soy yo <eos> Que soy el otro hombre que esperabas ver <eos> Un desconocido que te ha escrito un verso <eos> Y te dibujó la Luna en un trozo de papel <eos> Un amante improvisado, misterioso, apasionado <eos> Que te dio una cita en este hotel <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Y es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero te dejo y me marcho, para siempre <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Te juro que hoy es la última vez que te burlas de mí <eos> Que me engañas y me hieres <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Fue sorpresa para ti hallarme en el cuarto en lugar de tu amante <eos> Palideciste y te pusiste muy nerviosa <eos> Desnúdate ahora y apaga la luz un instante <eos> Y hazme el amor como lo haces con esos amantes <eos> Es mi corazón el que llora de pena por dentro <eos> Pero me marcho para siempre (Para siempre) <eos> Y fueron mis manos las que te escribieron la carta <eos> Han sido mis celos los que te pusieron la trampa <eos> Imagina que soy tu mejor amante <eos> Hazme el amor y luego adiós <eos> 
She said go to hell, those words just linger in the air <eos> Like that cold blank stare at my world up in flames <eos> Ash and dust, it’s just the memory of <eos> What I had and what I love is all that’s left of this place <eos> Preacher always said it’s fire and brimstone <eos> He ain’t never been so how the hell does he know? <eos> Hell is that summertime late night long way alone drive home <eos> Hell is that empty house not a sound screaming in my head you’re gone <eos> Yeah, I’ve seen the worst, felt thе burn, met the devil whеn you said goodbye <eos> I see him in the mirror, everywhere, now I’m just a man on fire <eos> Cause hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> Hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> I’ve seen the other side, she was my guiding light <eos> She was heaven and I’m the one that fell from grace <eos> Hell is that front seat, used to be you and me but now I’m solo <eos> Hell is that morning kiss that I miss don’t know how I’m gon’ move on <eos> Yeah, I’ve seen the worst, felt the burn, met the devil when you said goodbye <eos> I see him in the mirror, everywhere, now I’m just a man on fire <eos> Cause hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> Hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> Hell is that summertime late night long way alone drive home <eos> Hell is that empty house not a sound screaming in my head you’re gone <eos> Yeah, I’ve seen the worst, felt the burn, met the devil when you said goodbye <eos> I see him in the mirror, everywhere, now I’m just a man on fire <eos> Cause hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> Hell is anywhere without, anywhere without you <eos> 
I know the pieces fit <eos> 'Cause I watched them fall away <eos> Mildewed and smoldering <eos> Fundamental differing <eos> Pure intention juxtaposed <eos> Will set two lovers' souls in motion <eos> Disintegrating as it goes <eos> Testing our communication <eos> The light that fueled our fire then <eos> Has burned a hole between us so <eos> We cannot seem to reach an end <eos> Crippling our communication <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> 'Cause I watched them tumble down <eos> No fault, none to blame <eos> It doesn't mean I don't desire <eos> To point the finger, blame the other <eos> Watch the temple topple over <eos> To bring the pieces back together <eos> Rediscover communication <eos> The poetry that comes from the squaring off between <eos> And the circling is worth it <eos> Finding beauty in the dissonance <eos> There was a time that the pieces fit <eos> But I watched them fall away <eos> Mildewed and smoldering <eos> Strangled by our coveting <eos> I've done the math enough to know <eos> The dangers of our second guessing <eos> Doomed to crumble unless we grow <eos> And strengthen our communication <eos> Cold silence has a tendency to <eos> Atrophy any sense of compassion <eos> Between supposed lovers <eos> Between supposed lovers <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos> I know the pieces fit <eos>

Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She always has trouble <eos> Falling asleep <eos> And she likes to cuddle <eos> While under the sheets <eos> She loves pop songs <eos> And dancing, and bad trash TV <eos> There’s still a few other things <eos> She loves love notes and babies <eos> And likes giving gifts <eos> Has a hard time accepting <eos> A good compliment <eos> She loves hеr whole family <eos> And all of her friends <eos> So if you'rе the one she lets in <eos> Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart, don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> Kiss her with passion <eos> As much as you can <eos> Run your hands through her hair <eos> Whenever she’s sad <eos> And when she doesn’t notice <eos> How pretty she is <eos> Tell her over and over <eos> So she never forgets <eos> Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart, don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> She’ll love you <eos> If you love her like that <eos> She’ll love you <eos> If you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> 
I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house <eos> That don’t bother me <eos> I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out <eos> I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while <eos> Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me <eos> There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay <eos> But that’s not what gets me <eos> What hurts the most <eos> Was being so close <eos> And havin' so much to say <eos> And watchin' you walk away <eos> And never knowing <eos> What could've been <eos> And not seein' that love in you <eos> Is what I was tryin’ to do <eos> It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go <eos> But I’m doin’ It <eos> It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone <eos> Still harder <eos> Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret <eos> But I know if I could do it over <eos> I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart <eos> That I left unspoken <eos> What hurts the most <eos> Is being so close <eos> And havin' so much to say much to say <eos> And watchin' you walk away <eos> And never knowing <eos> What could've been <eos> And not seeing that love in you <eos> Is what I was trying to do, oh <eos> What hurts the most <eos> Was being so close <eos> And havin' so much to say (much to say) <eos> And watchin' you walk away <eos> And never knowing <eos> What could have been <eos> And not seeing that love in you <eos> Is what I was trying to do, oh <eos> Not seeing that love in you <eos> That’s what I was trying to do <eos>

ياعم يابتاع الحشيش، انا عايز حشيشة طرية <eos> أستنى يا بي ريل، دا الواجب دا عليا <eos> الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا <eos> الحشيشة اللي في جيبه غير الحشيشة اللي في ايديا <eos> ونصطبح أنا وأنت ونولع الدنيا <eos> ونشرب سطفا حلوة ونسميها: كايروفورنيا <eos> You're lookin' at the last of a dyin' breed <eos> Weeded up, please, speed it up <eos> Sittin' in the Cali sun heated up <eos> Inked arm needled up <eos> Rocket style, Don Cheadle'd up <eos> I put the fear of God in people, what <eos> People lookin' at me sideways like I'm on the verge <eos> Like them on the purp that's blazed, I don't say a word <eos> You don't wanna follow me, son <eos> You ain't got the nerve <eos> You just wanna swerve with a little herb, absurd <eos> Got you paranoid in the paragraph when I paraphrase <eos> Got a pair of Jordan's dancin' on your fuckin' face <eos> Paralyzed, see the paranormal paratroops <eos> Summoned by the Grandmaster as he prepares to loose <eos> Temple doors open up, smoke billows out <eos> Now you hoping, what, for mercy? Get your soul brilloed out <eos> From another hood, you ain't really fuckin' with our brotherhood <eos> Even if another could, I wish a motherfucker would <eos> Clip it up or sip it up <eos> Listen, I prefer to trip it up <eos> Chem skippy ya'll bitter fucks <eos> I can take a bigger chunk <eos> And if I'm callin' dark figures up <eos> Don't make a move, they light triggers up <eos> Muggs, cut 'em up, chka-chka, what, huh <eos> (This is for the-) <eos> وعنينا قفلت ودماغنا سافرت، سافرت في حتة تانية <eos> وسجارة ولعت وسجارة لفت، ولع سوجارة تانية <eos> عصابات السموكات، يلا نرول الجوبات <eos> عصابات السموكات، يلا نرول الجوبات <eos> يا رايق <eos> خليك سايق <eos> خليك رايق <eos> قولوا قولوا <eos> بتقولوا ايه <eos> قولوا قولوا <eos> بتقولوا ايه <eos> Ever heard of me? <eos> Wicked as you ever seen <eos> Heavy on the throttle <eos> Smoke when we hit the scene, rollin' unseen <eos> Under the cover of night <eos> Spirit flying free, niggas higher than a kite <eos> You got nothing on me, we some nomads <eos> And my clan goes way back to the Cro-Mags <eos> Run together, unbreakable bloodline <eos> Too much to fuck with when all the brothers combine <eos> Everything you ever heard of is not a myth <eos> Crazy dogs you don't ever wanna deal with <eos> Which smell? It's the hash that we left around <eos> Smoke a whole pound when I feel myself comin' down <eos> Live how I wanna live and answer to no one <eos> Similar to the ways of the shogun <eos> Think again before you try and come and get me <eos> Or you'll be shot up by a gang of gypsies (shot) <eos> وعنينا قفلت ودماغنا سافرت، سافرت في حتة تانية <eos> وسجارة ولعت وسجارة لفت، ولع سوجارة تانية <eos> عصابات السموكات <eos> عصابات السموكات، يلا نرول الجوبات <eos> عصابات السموكات، يلا نرول الجوبات <eos> 
La escuela nunca me gustó <eos> Aún recuerdo aquellos tiempos de la prepa <eos> Ya traía un billetón <eos> Desmadroso desde morro <eos> Ya ni modo, esta vida me tocó <eos> Y aquí andamos al millón <eos> Bien placoso y malandrón <eos> Tengo rayas en el cuerpo <eos> Que resaltan a dondequiera que voy <eos> El Sur Centro de Los Ángeles es mi casa <eos> Es de donde vengo yo <eos> Un saludo a mis homeboys <eos> Historias tengo de a montón <eos> Para no hacer largo el cuento <eos> Hoy ya no salgo sin la súper y el cuernón <eos> De atentados la he librado, dos tres veces <eos> Pero Dios no me dejó <eos> Y de frente la traición <eos> ¡Ea! <eos> Mi niño es mi bendición <eos> La razón por la cual no tiro la toalla <eos> No importa la situación <eos> Mi amuleto de la suerte es la familia <eos> Siempre han sido mi motor <eos> Los primos brincan en calor <eos> Noches de fiesta en Hollywood <eos> Cuando hay tiempo, nos perdemos con modelos <eos> Por allá en el W <eos> Hay billetes, no escatimo el presupuesto <eos> Puro Benjamín Azul <eos> Bien positivo es la actitud <eos> Para la chamba soy de acción <eos> Bien pendiente de todas las oficinas <eos> Todo está bajo control <eos> Quién diría que algún día <eos> El compa Jessie les iba a salir cabrón <eos> Aquí seguimos, no me voy <eos> 
Recuerdo que al llegar ni me miraste <eos> Fui solo una más de cientos <eos> Y, sin embargo, fueron tuyos <eos> Los primeros voleteos <eos> Cómo no pude darme cuenta <eos> Que hay ascensores prohibidos <eos> Que hay pecados compartidos <eos> Y que tú estabas tan cerca <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Mis anclajes no pararon tus instintos <eos> Ni los tuyos, mis quejidos <eos> Y dejo correr mis tuercas <eos> Y que hormigas me retuerzan <eos> Quiero que no dejes de estrujarme <eos> Sin que yo te diga nada <eos> Que tus yemas sean lagañas <eos> Enganchadas a mis vértices <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> No sé que acabó sucediendo <eos> Sólo sentí dentro dardos <eos> Nuestra incómoda postura <eos> Se dilató en el espacio <eos> Se me hunde el dolor en el costado <eos> Se me nublan los recodos <eos> Tengo sed y estoy tragando <eos> No quiero no estar a tu lado <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> Y las palabras se me apartan <eos> Me vacían las entrañas <eos> Finjo que no sé, y que no has sabido <eos> Finjo que no me gusta estar contigo <eos> Y al perderme entre mis dedos <eos> Te recuerdo sin esfuerzo <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> 
I don't commit, I just collide <eos> I won't submit, I'll just decide <eos> On where to run or where to hide <eos> Their eyes are everywhere <eos> I see them spying there <eos> At my face, at my hair <eos> I won't plug in, to their machine <eos> I hate the sound, I hate that scene <eos> I sure ain't hip, I sure can't hop <eos> I lost the script, I lost the plot <eos> Their spies are everywhere <eos> I feel them hiding there <eos> On my face, in my hair <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> It's pushing down, down, down <eos> Down on me <eos> Look at me, what you see <eos> Is social debris <eos> You said you'd treat me, but tried to delete me <eos> You think I'm tragic, but I know I'm magic <eos> Your eyes are everywhere <eos> I see you spying there <eos> At my face, at my hair <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> Pushing down, down, down <eos> Down on me <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> I'm social debris <eos> I just can't cope with all this disease <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> Social debris <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> Social debris <eos> Look at me, look at me <eos> I'm social debris <eos> 
You know <eos> The fire is running low <eos> Can you feel the flame her fading glow <eos> You know <eos> We are slowing down <eos> I can hear your footsteps drowning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> You are <eos> You singing now a song <eos> But you heard it somewhere else I know <eos> We are <eos> We're trying to belong <eos> Pick up the pieces left of us <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> If you can see me running up to you <eos> You know <eos> I've been running in circles around you <eos> If you could tell me I was back in time <eos> You know <eos> I've been running in circles for you <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> The lie has fallen from the stars <eos> Now your sinking through the night <eos> Out of sight we're falling underground <eos> Pick up the pieces left of us <eos> If you can see me running up to you <eos> We know ... <eos> I've been running in circles around you <eos> If you could tell me I was back in time <eos> You know ... <eos> I've been running in circles for you <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're the ashes on the ground <eos> We're burning up <eos> We're burning down <eos> We're falling underground <eos> You know ... <eos> The fire is running low  <eos> 
The town lights beneath the mountain side seem so dim <eos> As you lay there with your pensive mind in search for a hymn <eos> Then you realize that all thats left is your sad song <eos> That you sing to yourself, cuz no ones gonna come along <eos> You’ve lost your head you have lost your mind <eos> You really lost everything for me this time <eos> You’re broken now, you were broken then <eos> You’ve broken everything you meant to mend <eos> And now you’re spent <eos> But I know what you meant <eos> By what you say <eos> As the town lights fade <eos> From the mountaintop you can see the world through my eyes <eos> I begin to find that you're fed up with all the villagers’ lies <eos> The inspiration you had had  made the journey long <eos> So you sang a song, so you sang a song <eos> 
Suban el telón, abran las cortinas <eos> Enciendan las turbinas con nitroglicerina <eos> El desorden es tu penicilina <eos> Brincando curas los dolores sin aspirina <eos> Vamos a provocar un cortocircuito <eos> Antes de que en el 2012 caiga un meteorito <eos> A portarnos mal, a cometer delitos <eos> A comernos a Caperucita con los tres cerditos <eos> Esto no se trata de rebeldía <eos> Esto se trata de ser indisciplinado por un día <eos> Los incomprendidos del nuevo testamento <eos> Tenemos nuestras reglas, nuestro propio mandamientos <eos> Como no comprenden nuestro comportamiento <eos> A todos los psicólogos les damos tratamiento <eos> Pa' romper con la rutina repetitiva <eos> Que el sol salga de noche y que llueva para arriba <eos> Nos quieren controlar, como a control remoto <eos> Pero la autoridad, no puede con nosotros <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Oye, hoy vinimos a portarnos mal (mal) <eos> Como un niño con su resortera (mal) <eos> Como novia en despedida de soltera <eos> Vamo' a portarnos (mal), pero con dignidad <eos> Vamo' a hacer que Susan Boyle pierda su virginidad <eos> Somos diferentes, nada de lo que se espera <eos> Como una naranja con sabor a pera <eos> No somos clones, no somos imitaciones <eos> Hoy vinimos a hacer lo que no se supone <eos> Contar un cuento sin narrativa <eos> Tirar el cielo patas pa' arriba <eos> Como los árabes que escriben al revés <eos> (caminan con las manos, saludan con los pies) <eos> Con el pie izquierdo empieza el día <eos> Levanta tu cerveza, a brindar por la anarquía <eos> Mama huevaso, vuela sin techo <eos> Defiende tu derecho de hacer lo que no haz hecho <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Nos gusta el desorden (uo uo uooo) <eos> Rompemos con las reglas (uo uo uooo) <eos> Somos indisciplinados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Todos los malcriados (uo uo uooo) <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Vamo' a portarnos mal <eos> Como cuando te apuntan con una pistola <eos> La gente con las manos arriba que suban solas <eos> (Como si te apuntaran con una pistola) <eos> (¡Sube la mano!) <eos> (Como si te apuntaran con una pistola) <eos> (¡Sube la mano!) <eos> 
Come as you are, as you were <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a friend, as a friend <eos> As an old enemy <eos> Take your time, hurry up <eos> Choice is yours, don't be late <eos> Take a rest as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a trend, as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria (No, I don't have a gun) <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> 
It's not true <eos> Tell me I’ve been lied to <eos> Crying isn't like you, ooh <eos> What the hell did I do? <eos> Never been the type to <eos> Let someone see right through, ooh <eos> Maybe won't you take it back? <eos> Say you were tryna make me laugh <eos> And nothing has to change today <eos> You didn’t mean to say "I love you" <eos> I love you and I don't want to, ooh <eos> Up all night on another red-eye <eos> I wish we never learned to fly <eos> Maybe we should just try <eos> To tell ourselves a good lie <eos> Didn't mean to make you cry <eos> Maybe won't you take it back? <eos> Say you were tryna make me laugh <eos> And nothing has to change today <eos> You didn't mean to say "I love you" <eos> I love you and I don't want to, ooh <eos> The smile that you gave me <eos> Even when you felt like dying <eos> We fall apart as it gets dark <eos> I'm in your arms in Central Park <eos> There's nothing you could do or say <eos> I can’t escape the way I love you <eos> I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> 
If you told me all about your sorrows <eos> I'd tell you about a cure <eos> If you told me you can't fight the battle <eos> There's a Baby Boy who won the war <eos> The war was won by a Baby Boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> Oh, before that silent night <eos> No Savior and no Jesus Christ <eos> The world cried out so desperately <eos> And the Baby Boy was the reply <eos> Yes, Heaven's reply was a baby boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> See, the King is coming down <eos> And He's here without a crown <eos> The Baby Boy without a bed <eos> Giving life back to the dead <eos> And hear the angels shout it out <eos> As the people come and bow <eos> Unexpected majesty <eos> Alleluia, what a King <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it <eos> Alleluia, Heaven's ringing <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> Alleluia, we can sing it! <eos> Alleluia, yeah, Heaven's ringing! <eos> Alleluia! <eos> Endless hope and relentless joy started with a Baby Boy <eos> 
Letra de "Ayúdame Inspiración" ft. Vicente García <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> Yo quiero hacerle una canción a esta mujer <eos> No puede ser que me abandones otra vez <eos> Y me traiciones otra vez, inspiración <eos> Negándote <eos> Ya lo intenté con un poema y fracasé <eos> Fuimos al cine, al teatro y al ballet <eos> Ninguna de esas estrategias funcionó <eos> Ayúdame <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Una letra que le pueda enamorar <eos> Y le daré la más bella canción con mi guitarra <eos> Solo falta que me quieras ayudar, no me vuelvas a fallar <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> La, la, la <eos> Y decidí volver a la composición <eos> Y recurrir a mi experiencia musical <eos> Estoy seguro que la puede conquistar <eos> Cantándole <eos> No es tan difícil componer una canción <eos> Cuando se tiene voluntad y vocación <eos> Pero es más fácil con tu colaboración <eos> Ayúdame <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Una letra que le pueda enamorar <eos> Y le daré la más bella canción con mi guitarra <eos> Solo falta que me quieras ayudar, no me vuelvas a fallar <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Y trataré de hallar la melodía que le agrada <eos> Cuando escucha mi guitarra enamorada <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Hoy, como ayer, yo te sigo queriendo, mujer <eos> Inspiración ayúdame para cantarle a esa mujer <eos> Ya no me queda tiempo para cantarte de nuevo, mi cielo <eos> Woah, woah, woah, woah <eos> Woah, woah, woah, woah <eos> Woah, woah (¡Ayúdame!), woah, woah(¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Woah, woah (¡Ayúdame!), woah, woah(¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Baile (¡Ayúdame!) <eos> Pero póngase sabrosura (¡Ayúdame!) <eos> ¡Ayúdame, ayúdame! <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> Ay, esa cosa que me hiciste me gustó (¡Ayúdame, ayúdame!) <eos> ¡Ayúdame, ayúdame! <eos> ¡Ayúdame!

Many rivers to cross <eos> But I can't seem to find my way over <eos> Wandering I am lost as I travel along <eos> The white cliffs of Dover <eos> Many rivers to cross and it's only my will <eos> That keeps me alive <eos> I've been licked, washed up for years and <eos> I merely survive because of my pride <eos> And this loneliness won't leave me alone <eos> It's such a drag to be on your own <eos> My woman left and she didn't say why <eos> Well I guess I have to try <eos> Many rivers to cross but just where to begin <eos> I'm playing for time <eos> There'll be times I find myself thinking <eos> Of committing some dreadful crime <eos> I've got many rivers to cross <eos> But I can't seem to find my way over <eos> Wandering I am lost as I travel along <eos> The white cliffs of Dover <eos> Many rivers to cross and it's only my will <eos> That keeps me alive <eos> I've been licked, washed up for years and <eos> I merely survive because of my pride <eos>

Don't hold yourself like that <eos> You'll hurt your knees <eos> Well I kissed your mouth and back <eos> But that's all I need <eos> Don't build your world around <eos> Volcanoes melt you down <eos> What I am to you is not real <eos> What I am to you, you do not need <eos> What I am to you is not what you mean to me <eos> You give me miles and miles of mountains <eos> And I'll ask for the sea <eos> Don't throw yourself like that <eos> In front of me <eos> I kissed your mouth, your back <eos> Is that all you need? <eos> Don't drag my love around <eos> Volcanoes melt me down <eos> What I am to you is not real <eos> What I am to you, you do not need <eos> What I am to you is not what you mean to me <eos> You give me miles and miles of mountains <eos> And I'll ask . .  <eos> What I give to you <eos> Is just what I'm going through <eos> This is nothing new, no no <eos> Just another phase of finding <eos> What I really need <eos> Is what makes me bleed <eos> But like a new disease <eos> Lord, she's still too young to treat <eos> What I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (I kissed your mouth) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (I kissed your mouth) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> And what I am to you (oh she's still too young) <eos> (I kissed your mouth) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> Is not real, (she's still too young) <eos> What I am to you, (oh she's still too young) <eos> (I kissed your mouth) <eos> (Volcanoes melt you down) <eos> You do not need (she's still too young) <eos> You do not need me <eos>

Traffic from the East side got me aggravated <eos> Hotter than the day my brother graduated <eos> Wait for hours in the sun in line at Dodger Stadium <eos> I'm not scared of dogs or getting vaccinated <eos> Lay the seat back, turn this place into a bed <eos> Someone's smoking in the Camry just ahead <eos> Yeah, I know the irony would never be lost on me <eos> You don't have to point it out again <eos> What will we say to each other <eos> When the needle goes in? <eos> What will we be to each other <eos> If the world doesn't еnd? <eos> Radio is static through the Taylor song <eos> Think a college football gamе is comin' on <eos> God you hate Top 40 shit, but as the sports preempted it <eos> Your mouth in my ear, you hummed along <eos> What will we say to each other <eos> When the needle goes in? <eos> What will we be to each other <eos> If the world doesn't end? <eos> I think the nurse that gave our shots is judging us <eos> Can she tell that we just fucked the friendship up? <eos> As we leave, I turn to you, ask how it feels to be immune <eos> And you know what I mean a bit too much <eos> What will we say to each other <eos> When the needle goes in? <eos> What will we be to each other <eos> If the world doesn't end? <eos> What will we say to each other? <eos> What will we be to each other? <eos>

The sun is shining <eos> There's plenty of light <eos> A new day is dawning <eos> Sunny and bright <eos> But after I've been crying all night <eos> The sun is cold <eos> And the new day seems old <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> The birds are singing <eos> And the children are playing <eos> There's plenty of work <eos> And the bosses are paying <eos> Not a sad word should <eos> A young heart be saying <eos> But fun is a bore <eos> And with money I'm poor <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Next time I'll be kinder <eos> (Next time I'll be kinder) <eos> Won't you please help me find her <eos> (Won't you please help me find her) <eos> Someone just remind her <eos> (Someone just remind her) <eos> Of this love she left behind her <eos> (Of this love she left behind her) <eos> 'Til I find her I'll be trying <eos> ('Til I find her I'll be trying) <eos> Every day I'm more inclined to find her <eos> Inclined to find her <eos> (Inclined to find my baby) <eos> Been looking everywhere (Baby) <eos> Baby, I really, really care <eos> Oh, determination is fading fast (Oh yeah) <eos> Inspiration is a thing of the past (Oh yeah) <eos> Can't see how my hope's gonna last <eos> Good things are bad <eos> And what's happy is sad <eos> Since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Oh, since I lost my baby <eos> (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I feel so bad (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I feel so sad (Since I lost my baby) <eos> Everything is wrong (Since I lost my baby) <eos> This heart is hard to carry on (Since I lost my baby) <eos> I'm lost as can be (Since I lost my baby) <eos> What's gonna happen to me? <eos>

We're in the homestretch of the hard times <eos> We took a hard left, but we're alright <eos> Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but <eos> We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I <eos> Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried <eos> No, it don't always go the way we planned it <eos> But the wolves came and went and we're still standing <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> When the bones are good <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter) <eos> Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh) <eos> Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah) <eos> When the bones are good, the rest don't matter <eos> Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter <eos> Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain) <eos> 'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo) <eos> When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo) <eos> Baby, I know any storm we're facing <eos> Will blow right over while we stay put <eos> The house don't fall when the bones are good <eos> Yeah, ooh <eos> 

Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I'll never kill myself to save my soul) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> (I didn't come this far to sink so low) <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> I'm just weathering a rough patch <eos> Another villain with an itch to scratch <eos> Denial is the darkest when you live in a hole <eos> Why does the hell make you feel so cold? <eos> Make a move and you pay for it <eos> Pick a lord and you pray to it <eos> You're so demanding when you want the truth <eos> But your stories don't read for me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> Indecision overload <eos> Keep a buckle on the devil and your eyes on the road <eos> Reaching out for the hand of God <eos> But did you think you'd shake your own? <eos> This killing field is all grown over <eos> The motherfucker wants it wild <eos> Go sow your oats in alphabetical order <eos> The anti-antagonist is back in style <eos> Myopic, cannot see straight <eos> Dystopic, one sin too late <eos> You gotta lie if you wanna believe <eos> But your bibles don't work on me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting <eos> Go <eos> Did you think you could win? And fill me in? <eos> Did you think you could do it again? I'm not your sin <eos> I was all that you wanted and more, but you didn't want me <eos> I was more than you thought I could be <eos> So I'm setting you free, I'm setting you free <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> Oh, I'll never kill myself to save my soul <eos> I was gone, but how was I to know? <eos> I didn't come this far to sink so low <eos> I'm finally holding on to letting go <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos> You've killed the saint in me <eos> How dare you martyr me? <eos> 
You don't hear me <eos> You don’t see me <eos> You don't know I'm ever around <eos> I’m walking horizons wearing the starlight for disguise <eos> You don't hear me <eos> You don't trust me <eos> You don't know I'm ever around <eos> I travel horizons shining the moonlight in your eyes (Yeah) <eos> Mm (Yeah) <eos> You don't hear me <eos> You don't see me <eos> You don't know I’m ever around <eos> I travel horizons wearing the starlight for disguise <eos> You don’t know me <eos> You don't trust me <eos> You don’t know, know, know, know I'm ever around <eos> I travel horizons shining the moonlight in your eyes (Yeah) <eos> Mm (Yeah) <eos> When I'm gone, I'm gone to stay <eos> ’Cause living hеre just ain't my way <eos> And I'll be lonely, lonеly, lonely, lonely, long, long gone <eos> By the break of day <eos> By the break of day <eos> You don't hear me <eos> You don't see me <eos> You don't know I'm ever around <eos> I travel horizons wearing the starlight for disguise (Yeah) <eos> You don't know me <eos> You don't trust me <eos> You don't know, know, know, know I'm ever around <eos> I travel horizons shining the moonlight in your eyes (Yeah) <eos> Ooh (Yeah) <eos>

Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair <eos> I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear <eos> She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear <eos> I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year <eos> I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep <eos> My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep <eos> But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> I try so hard, I can't rise above it <eos> Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin' <eos> But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy <eos> But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me <eos> Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors <eos> I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors <eos> I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss <eos> Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this <eos> 'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> I try so hard, I can't rise above it <eos> Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin' <eos> But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> Gotta wash my truck and dress up <eos> To pick her up to watch TV <eos> And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer <eos> She can't get enough of me <eos> Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> I try so hard, I can't rise above it <eos> Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin' <eos> But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it <eos> Come on, baby <eos> You know what I like <eos> Yeah, I like that <eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm <eos> Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights <eos>

Brother I am air.space <eos> I use the internet every night to escape <eos> Escapades <eos> Oh my days those essays <eos> Chop up the venison steaks <eos> Get laced with these lewd tunes <eos> Introduce you to the most scrutinized Genre of Music <eos> Most of you just abuse it <eos> I tell the truth and pursue it <eos> Others refuting the movement <eos> I’m used to it now, I’m winning every time that I lose it <eos> So I give a fuck what you do <eos> Cause ain’t nothing new <eos> Shit imma do what I want to <eos> Hit em w. a 21|12 <eos> With enough insight to ignite this hellhole <eos> So it’s time to let the whole fuckin world know <eos> My new state of mind bro <eos> Might go, J. Cole <eos> That means kill the game and invite witnesses <eos> Society the drivers seat the first one to get killed? <eos> Well they better pull us over for driving under the influence <eos> Says the joker to the thief <eos> I’m poking holes in your hoody <eos> This emptiness that you seek <eos> Fake rapper tweets <eos> I’m meddling with their stories <eos> And you would have got away with it too if it wasn’t for me <eos> Balling on thin ice skating on my blades of glory <eos> You fuckers have the gall to say “have you got something for me” <eos> Ignoring all the hating, debating, anticipating <eos> You brothers should look me up like celestial navigation <eos> Why the fuck you think I spent months cultivating? <eos> Tryna shift the culture? <eos> Need to motivate a cruel summer <eos> Followed by a late registration <eos> Post graduation, mine for the taking <eos> AK-47’s at the gates of heaven <eos> Shooting down any demons even stepping to this reverence <eos> This testament, my evidence <eos> What it takes to stay true and stay relevant <eos>

(Tenement slum <eos> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah) <eos> You think that I don't feel love <eos> But what I feel for you is real love <eos> In those eyes, I see reflected <eos> A hurt, scorned, rejected <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, born in poverty <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, take a look at me <eos> Started my life in an old, cold, rundown <eos> Tenement slum (Tenement slum) <eos> My father left, he never even married Mom <eos> I shared the guilt my mama knew <eos> So afraid that others knew I had no name <eos> Ah, this love we're contemplating <eos> Is worth the pain of waiting <eos> We'll only end up hating <eos> The child we may be creating <eos> Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child (Scorned by) society <eos> Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, different from the rest <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out) <eos> I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt <eos> To be without the simple things <eos> So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me <eos> Ah, don't think that I don't need you <eos> Don't think I don't wanna please you <eos> But no child of mine will be bearing <eos> The name of shame I've been wearing <eos> Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> You (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos>

All the way from Waco to WeHo with a rabbit on her chain <eos> Drove a little slick car to tend bar with the static on her brain <eos> She's a little burner, burner, gonna throw you to the flame <eos> Little ticking time bomb, time bomb, gonna blow us all away <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos> Tex, he was her boyfriend with no kin always running from the law <eos> Every other weekend, the week ends with his back in her claw <eos> He's a livewire, wired, shooting sparks in the night <eos> He’s a gun for a hire, hired with a bead in his sights <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, facing where the lines are broken <eos> Oh, name your price to all this living <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos> Oh, take the time to waste a moment <eos> Oh, face it where the lines are broken <eos> Oh, name a price to all that's living <eos> Oh, never ask to be forgiven <eos>

Caught in my mind, I'm just a misfit <eos> Leave me to die, the world can't fix it <eos> Thought I was fine, but I'm sick <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one will help you now <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now, safe now <eos> Caught in a brilliant state of mind, I <eos> Thought I was sick, but I am fine, I lied <eos> Thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos> We'll torch every street and watch the whole Earth fry <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Fear not, my dear, liberate the Earth <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> I thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos>

Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Enfrentarlo y no puedo, no puedo <eos> En el viaje perdí mi verdad <eos> Siendo una estrella dejé de brillar <eos> Mil voces comenzaron hablar (Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla) <eos> Mi subconsciente comenzó atacar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Cada noche el silencio es un mar (Un mar) <eos> En él me ahoga una tempestad <eos> Camino y corro para borrar (Para borrar, para borrar) <eos> Y en mi locura todo cuestionar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> En la tormenta que habita en mí <eos> El sol brilla fuerte y lo puedo sentir <eos> Puede envolverme alma y mente <eos> Sentir que puedo seguir <eos> Quiero hablar y yo puedo <eos> Respirar y yo puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y yo puedo <eos> Quiero estar, y yo puedo <eos> Escuchar y yo puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme, yo puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad <eos> 
What child is this who laid to rest <eos> On Mary's lap is sleeping <eos> Whom Angels greet <eos> With anthems sweet <eos> While shepherds watch are keeping <eos> Why lies He in such mean estate <eos> Where ox and ass are feeding <eos> Good Christians fear <eos> For sinners here <eos> The silent Word is pleading <eos> This, this is Christ the King <eos> Whom shepherds guard and angels sing <eos> Haste, haste to bring Him laud <eos> The babe, the Son of Mary <eos> So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh <eos> Come peasant, king to own Him <eos> The King of Kings salvation brings <eos> Let loving hearts enthrone Him <eos> Nails, spears shall pierce Him through <eos> The cross He bore for me, for you <eos> Hail, hail the word made flesh <eos> The babe, the Son of Mary <eos> 
Tear the feeling from the fool's heart <eos> It seems the meaning just escapes you <eos> And you're nowhere near the worst part <eos> His arrows struck him in this heart he'd never use <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Broken banister will fix him <eos> The flight of stairs has let him through <eos> Bent-over, brought to his addiction <eos> He surfaced once, but his courage was confused <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos> Sounds good, he sounds alright <eos> (On the first day, he swears) <eos> The secret's in the sacrifice <eos>

I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on <eos> I have screamed until my veins collapsed <eos> I've waited as my time's elapsed <eos> Now all I do is live with so much fate <eos> I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <eos> I've left behind this little fact <eos> You cannot kill what you did not create <eos> I've gotta say what I've gotta say <eos> And then I swear I'll go away <eos> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <eos> I guess I'll save the best for last <eos> My future seems like one big past <eos> You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <eos> Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone <eos> Tell me the reality is better than the dream <eos> But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> 
You could open with your failings <eos> Make them understand, show the love notes <eos> Make them picture with their eyes closed <eos> Make them wonder where the time goes <eos> Keep your distance south of river <eos> Draw a line, they are not together <eos> Make it screech, stop, wait, turn red <eos> Make me wonder where the time went <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> Be not a stranger land here <eos> I will leave this empty-handed <eos> Feeling selfish, common as shit <eos> Leave me question where your heart lends <eos> How you open-wounded withstand <eos> Lead me into some false pretence <eos> I will ruin you in a second <eos> Leave it up to interpretation <eos> Open-ended invitation <eos> And your wedding, I could crash it <eos> Whisper in your ear “God, I missed you <eos> It's been too much, I can’t stand it” <eos> Then I cried there in the staff room <eos> Selling my seats to your concert <eos> I won't stomach it if I see you <eos> Walking so tall, I can't reach you <eos> Happier, pretty picture <eos> With some new pretty little blue <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos> You will not save me a stand-off <eos>

(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To explain in due time all I know <eos> Time is a valuable thing <eos> Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings <eos> Watch it count down to the end of the day <eos> The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal) <eos> Didn't look out below <eos> Watch the time go right out the window <eos> Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know <eos> I wasted it all just to watch you go <eos> I kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> One thing, I don't know why <eos> It doesn't even matter how hard you try <eos> Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme <eos> To remind myself how I tried so hard <eos> In spite of the way you were mockin' me <eos> Actin' like I was part of your property <eos> Rememberin' all the times you fought with me <eos> I'm surprised it got so far <eos> Things aren't the way they were before <eos> You wouldn't even recognize me anymore <eos> Not that you knew me back then <eos> But it all comes back to me in the end <eos> You kept everything inside <eos> And even though I tried, it all fell apart <eos> What it meant to me will eventually be <eos> A memory of a time when I tried so hard <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I've put my trust in you <eos> Pushed as far as I can go <eos> For all this <eos> There's only one thing you should know <eos> I tried so hard and got so far <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> I had to fall to lose it all <eos> But in the end it doesn't even matter <eos> 
(Ah) <eos> Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily <eos> You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks <eos> Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? <eos> (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself <eos> I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped <eos> Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl <eos> Well, good for you <eos> You look happy and healthy, not me <eos> If you ever cared to ask <eos> Good for you <eos> You're doin' great out there without me, baby <eos> God, I wish that I could do that <eos> I've lost my mind, I've spent the night <eos> Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom <eos> But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it <eos> But I guess good for you <eos> Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah) <eos> You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah) <eos> It's like we never even happened <eos> Baby, what the fuck is up with that?

In a few weeks, I will get time <eos> To realise it's right before my eyes <eos> And I can take it if it's what I want to do <eos> I am leaving and this is starting <eos> To feel like it's right before my eyes <eos> And I can taste it, it's my sweet beginning <eos> And I can tell just what you want <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> And I can't say it's what you know <eos> But you've known it the whole time <eos> Yeah, you've known it the whole time <eos> Maybe next year, I'll have no time <eos> To think about the questions to address <eos> Am I the one to try to stop the fire? <eos> I wouldn't test you, I'm not the best you <eos> Could have obtained, why try anything? <eos> I will get there; just remember, I know <eos> And I can tell just what you want <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> And I can't say it's what you know <eos> But you've known it the whole time <eos> Yeah, you've known it the whole time <eos> And I can tell just what you want <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> You don't want to be alone <eos> And I can't say it's what you know <eos> But you've known it the whole time <eos> Yeah, you've known it the whole time <eos> 
No existe amor perfecto <eos> Y empiezo a pensar que esto del amor es una fantasía <eos> Y no me la creo, que tú ya no te acuerdes <eos> De todas las veces que te hice mía <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Tе hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchastе cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de rogarte <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchaste cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de <eos> De rogarte <eos> 
Tengo tantas ganas <eos> Ay, de besarte en las mañanas, justo cuando te levantas (Te amo) <eos> Pero tengo miedo (Tengo miedo) <eos> Que busques a alguien perfecto y yo tan de carne y hueso (Te amo) <eos> Si pudiera controlar el tiempo <eos> Yo volvería a esperar de nuevo <eos> Una y mil veces <eos> Pa' ver cómo amaneces <eos> Por primera vez, un amanecer bonito <eos> Por primera vez, lo que quiero y necesito <eos> Por primera vez, hoy duerme el cielo conmigo <eos> Por primera vez, yo volví a nacer contigo <eos> Yeah, yeah, contigo <eos> Si yo te tengo no me falta nada (No) <eos> Tan largo que fue ayer y ya casi es mañana <eos> Pa' darte los beso' que nunca nos dimo', mmm (Mm, mmm) <eos> Para decirte cosa' bonita' siempre yo aquí estaré <eos> Porque yo me siento bien cuando tú te sientes bien <eos> Mi vida es vida solo contigo <eos> Si tú no estás, no tiene sentido, amor <eos> Lo que quiero y necesito (Tú y yo) <eos> Por primera vez, un amanecer bonito (Un amanecer bonito) <eos> Por primera vez, lo que quiero y necesito (Tú eres lo que yo necesito) <eos> Por primera vez, hoy duerme el cielo conmigo (Yeah, yeah; te amo) <eos> Por primera vez, yo volví a nacer contigo (Yeah, yeah, contigo) <eos> Mi vida es vida solo contigo (Solo contigo) <eos> Si tú no estás, no tiene sentido, amor (Que no tiene sentido) <eos> Lo que quiero y necesito <eos> Mi vida es vida solo contigo <eos> Si tú no estás, no tiene sentido, amor <eos> Lo que quiero y necesito (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> Por primera vez, un amanecer bonito (Un amanecer bonito) <eos> Por primera vez, lo que quiero y necesito (Que te quiero, ven) <eos> Por primera vez, hoy duerme el cielo conmigo <eos> Por primera vez, yo volví a nacer contigo (Yeah, yeah, contigo) <eos> Si pudiera controlar el tiempo <eos> Yo volvería a esperar de nuevo <eos> Una y mil veces <eos> Pa' ver cómo amaneces <eos>

Welcome to the rest of our lives <eos> We've been sleeping awake with our eyes closed tight <eos> Drifting through time, like we're ghosts <eos> And searching for what's left, is what cost us the most <eos> This is the part where I should tell you <eos> How good I'm doing, how everything's okay <eos> But the truth is I can't remember the times <eos> When I felt anything, other than hatred and pain <eos> Are you one of the broken ones? <eos> Well join to the fucking club <eos> We're one in a billion souls <eos> Shunned by the ones they loved <eos> All the hope I feel it fading away <eos> Takes every part of me, not to be afraid <eos> Don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep <eos> 'Cause through your nightmares the demons will creep <eos> Along the way, I lost myself <eos> Life fucked me over, like it does everyone else <eos> Don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep <eos> 'Cause through your nightmares the demons will creep <eos> Come find me <eos> I'm hidden somewhere deep in the dark <eos> Walking aimlessly without my heart <eos> And only you can show me the way out of this nightmare <eos> Where I'm forced to remain in! <eos> Please help me find my way out! <eos> My fucking lungs are caving in <eos> And I'm suffocating <eos> As I claw my out of this darkness I've become <eos> I come from nothing <eos> A place I can hear all my demons scream <eos> There's no use in saving me! <eos> (Don't fall asleep!) <eos> All the hope I feel it fading away <eos> Takes every part of me, not to be afraid <eos> Don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep <eos> 'Cause through your nightmares the demons will creep <eos> Along the way, I lost myself <eos> Life fucked me over, like it does everyone else <eos> Don't fall asleep, don't fall asleep <eos> 'Cause through your nightmares the demons will creep <eos>

Girl, I’ve always loved you, oh, but something’s changed <eos> Blame it on time, the road or the ride, but it ain't the same <eos> It’s a different kind of feeling, not the one I knew <eos> From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits <eos> Girl, I've always loved you, but <eos> I don’t love you like I used to <eos> This gets better every time you kiss me like this <eos> It’s stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah <eos> More than every single day before <eos> Didn’t know I could ever love you more than I did <eos> But baby, I do, I don't love you like I used to, no <eos> What we got ain't got no ending, like a band of solid gold <eos> It’s sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old <eos> And oh, we thought we knew what it meant way back then <eos> Oh, but I keep fallin' all in higher than I've ever been, oh no, oh <eos> I don't love you like I used to <eos> This gets better every time you kiss me like this <eos> It’s stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah <eos> More than every single day before <eos> Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did <eos> But baby, I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no <eos> Oh no <eos> Oh no, no-no <eos> I don't love you like I used to <eos> This gets better every time you kiss me like this <eos> It's stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah <eos> More than every single day before <eos> Didn't know I could ever love you more than I did <eos> But baby, I do, I don’t love you like I used to, no <eos> Oh, oh <eos> I don't love you like I used to <eos> Oh, oh, no <eos> (Love you like I used to) <eos> Love you like I used to, yeah <eos> Oh, I don’t love you like I used to <eos> 
If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man <eos> You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me <eos> The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say <eos> I don't share your greed, the only card I need is <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> Playing for the high one, dancing with the devil <eos> Going with the flow, it's all a game to me <eos> Seven or Eleven, snake eyes watching you <eos> Double up or quit, double stake or split <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> You know I'm born to lose, and gambling's for fools <eos> But that's the way I like it baby, I don't wanna live forever <eos> And don't forget the joker! <eos> Pushing up the ante, I know you got to see me <eos> Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again <eos> I see it in your eyes, take one look and die <eos> The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> The Ace of Spades <eos> 
No air left in this metal box <eos> Those eyes will make me miss my stop <eos> Are they lookin' at me? <eos> Or just my direction? <eos> Block out the world that's buzzin' on <eos> I'm askin' "Where do you get off?" <eos> Is that the way to start this conversation? <eos> And now my mouth is dry and my words are <eos> Slow <eos> I can't stop crackin' under pressure <eos> I'm hopin' this day gets better <eos> I can't stop crackin' under pressure <eos> Please help me get better <eos> Two down and only one alone <eos> Speak now and nothin' will go wrong <eos> I'm not a psycho <eos> That's just my reflection <eos> I know we'll never meet again <eos> Why can't I say what's in my head <eos> My mind is stuck <eos> Is there a loose connection? <eos> And now my tongue is tied and my words are <eos> Slow <eos> I can't stop crackin' under pressure <eos> I'm hopin' this day gets better <eos> I can't stop crackin' under pressure <eos> Please help me get better <eos> Now my mouth is dry and my words are <eos> Slow <eos> I can't stop crackin' under pressure <eos> Fuck knows it doesn't give me any pleasure <eos> I can't keep crackin' under pressure <eos> Help me <eos> I need to get better <eos>

Él siempre me recogía <eos> Con su mirada de amante <eos> Y me llevaba a lugares que yo no conocía <eos> Cuando me recogía <eos> Hablábamos de la vida <eos> Y de sus planes cambiantes <eos> Hablábamos del presente, de ayudar a la gente <eos> De los tiempos de antes <eos> Pero no lo vol-, no lo, lo volví a ver <eos> Luego no lo vol-, no lo, lo volví a ver <eos> Si yo decía la verdad, entonces <eos> Sería obvio que él también lo hacía <eos> Él me miraba con sus ojos noche <eos> Y yo le creía lo que me decía <eos> Él siempre me recogía <eos> En su carroza flotante <eos> Y me mostraba la luna <eos> Me leía mi fortuna, me sentía importante <eos> Andábamos por la noche <eos> Buscando algún escondite <eos> Para decirnos las cosas que solo con palabras <eos> Imposible decirse <eos> Pero no lo vol-, no lo, lo volví a ver <eos> Luego no lo vol-, no yo lo busqué <eos> Si yo decía la verdad, entonces <eos> Sería obvio que él también lo hacía <eos> Él me miraba con sus ojos noche <eos> Y yo le creía lo que decía <eos> Si yo decía la verdad, entonces <eos> Él me miraba con sus ojos de noche <eos> (De noche, de noche, de noche) <eos> Ven y me muestras todo lo que escondes <eos> Para curarnos todas las heridas <eos> Ven y me miras con tus ojos de noche <eos> Ven y me muestras todo lo que escondes <eos> Para curarnos todas las heridas <eos> Ven y me miras con tus ojos de noche <eos> Si yo decía la verdad, entonces <eos> Sería obvio que él también lo hacía <eos> Él me miraba con sus ojos noche <eos> Y yo le creía lo que decía <eos>

Tell me, can this be real <eos> How can I put into words what I feel? <eos> My life was complete, I thought I was whole <eos> Why do I feel like I'm losing control? <eos> I never thought that love could feel like this <eos> And then you changed my world with just one kiss <eos> How can it be that right here with me <eos> There's an angel? It's a miracle <eos> Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep <eos> Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep <eos> When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true <eos> God must have spent a little more time on you, oh <eos> A little more time, yes he did, babe <eos> In all of creation, all things great and small <eos> You are the one that surpasses them all <eos> More precious than any diamond or pearl <eos> They broke the mold when you came in this world <eos> And then I'm trying hard to figure out <eos> Just how I ever did without <eos> The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child <eos> That's deep inside, it leaves me purified <eos> Your love is like a river, peaceful and deep <eos> Your soul is like a secret that I never could keep <eos> When I look into your eyes, I know that it's true <eos> God must have spent a little more time on you <eos> On you on you on you, you, on you on you, on you, you <eos> I never thought that love could feel like this <eos> And then you changed my world with just one kiss <eos> And how can it be that right here with me <eos> There's an angel?

I wish I would've met you <eos> Now it's a little late <eos> What you could've taught me <eos> I could've saved some face <eos> They think that your early ending was all wrong <eos> For the most part, they're right <eos> But look how they all got strong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> Now that the smoke's gone <eos> And the air is all clear <eos> Those who were right there <eos> Got a new kind of fear <eos> You'd fight and you were right <eos> But they were just too strong <eos> They'd stick it in your face <eos> And let you smell what they consider wrong <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> Good shot, man." <eos> That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot <eos> What a good shot, man." <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot <eos> A man has gun <eos> Hey, man, have fun <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> Nice shot, man <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I wish I would have met you <eos> I'd say, "Nice shot." <eos> 
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean <eos> She was the best damn woman that I ever seen <eos> She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies <eos> Knocking me out with those American thighs <eos> Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air <eos> She told me to come, but I was already there <eos> 'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking <eos> My mind was aching, and we were making it <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> Working double-time on the seduction line <eos> She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine <eos> Wanted no applause, just another course <eos> Made a meal outta me, and come back for more <eos> Had to cool me down to take another round <eos> Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing <eos> That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking <eos> My mind was aching, and we were making it <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> It knocked me out that <eos> You shook me all night long <eos> It had me shaking <eos> And you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> Well, you took me <eos> You really took me and <eos> You shook me all night long <eos> Ah, you shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long <eos> You really got me and you, shook me all night long <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> Yeah, you shook me <eos> All night long <eos> 
Fuck... <eos> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road <eos> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go <eos> So make the best of this test, and don't ask why <eos> It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> So take the photographs and still frames in your mind <eos> Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time <eos> Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial <eos> For what it's worth, it was worth all the while <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life... <eos> 
I don't ever look back <eos> No you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> So don't think twice because <eos> I ain't afraid of the slow burn <eos> And one thing's for sure <eos> It's good to make a good thing last <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Take ahold of my hand <eos> I'm gonna love you <eos> Slow like the hourglass sand <eos> God knows, I've spent a lifetime of lonely wanderin' <eos> But I'm all in for good <eos> I wanna be your man <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Girl, I'm in it till the end <eos> Forever and again <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I don't ever look back <eos> No, you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> 
The first star I see may not be a star <eos> We can't do a thing but wait <eos> So let's wait for one more <eos> And the time, such clumsy time <eos> In deciding if it's time <eos> I'm careful but not sure how it goes <eos> You can lose yourself in your courage <eos> When the time we have now ends <eos> When the big hand goes round again <eos> Can you still feel the butterflies? <eos> Can you still hear the last goodnight? <eos> And the mindless comfort grows <eos> When I'm alone with my great plans <eos> And this is what she said gets her through it <eos> "If I don't let myself be happy now, then when? <eos> If not now, when?" <eos> When the time we have now ends <eos> When the big hand goes round again <eos> Can you still feel the butterflies? <eos> Can you still hear the last goodnight? <eos> I close my eyes and believe <eos> Wherever you are, an angel for me <eos> When the time we have now ends <eos> When the big hand goes round again <eos> Can you still feel the butterflies? <eos> Can you still hear the last goodnight? <eos> 
Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by <eos> I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy <eos> To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true <eos> Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you" <eos> But it was just my imagination, runnin' away with me <eos> It was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah) <eos> A cozy little home out in the country <eos> With two children, maybe three <eos> I tell you I can visualize it all <eos> This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems <eos> But it was just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> Ev'ry night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, hear my plea <eos> Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die <eos> Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me <eos> I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me <eos> Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> I’ve never met her but I can't forget her <eos> Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos>

Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit <eos> Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it <eos> But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life <eos> Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Oh, no, no, no <eos> All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound <eos> One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you <eos> And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain <eos> And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no <eos> Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no <eos> Can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me <eos> Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over <eos> (There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no <eos> 
Wish I were with you <eos> But I couldn't stay <eos> Every direction <eos> Leads me away <eos> Pray for tomorrow <eos> But for today <eos> All I want is to be home <eos> Stand in the mirror <eos> You look the same <eos> Just lookin' for shelter <eos> From cold and the pain <eos> Someone to cover <eos> Safe from the rain <eos> Echoes and silence <eos> Patience and grace <eos> All of these moments <eos> I'll never replace <eos> No fear of my heart <eos> Absence of faith <eos> People I've loved <eos> I have no regrets <eos> Some I remember <eos> Some I forget <eos> Some of them living <eos> Some of them dead <eos> 
The cattle are prowlin' <eos> The coyotes are howlin' <eos> Way out where the doggies roam <eos> Where spurs are a jinglin' <eos> And the cowboy is singing <eos> His lonesome cattle call <eos> He rides in the sun <eos> 'Til his days work is done <eos> And he rounds up the cattle each fall <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> For hours he would ride <eos> On the range far and wide <eos> When the night wind blows up and slow <eos> His heart is a feather <eos> In all kinds of weather <eos> He sings his cattle call <eos> He's browned as a fairy <eos> From ridin' the prairie <eos> And he sings with an western drawl <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> 
Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cruzaste la frontera de otro cuerpo <eos> Por qué saltaste hacia el abismo de otros besos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Cada mañana en el reflejo de mis sueños <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué cambiaste nuestro amor por un antojo <eos> Y desnudaste tu pudor ante otros ojos <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Por qué perdiste el equilibrio y te alejaste de mi vida... <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo en aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos> Muy buena suerte <eos> Yo te deseo un paraíso de mentiras <eos> Un universo con estrellas que no brillan <eos> Yo te quería <eos> Y me obligaste renunciar a la mitad de mi alegría <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías... <eos> Un día entenderás que fue un error <eos> Cambiar la realidad por fantasía <eos> Ya no te extraño cuando canto tu canción <eos> No me hace falta tu deseo aquí en mi cama <eos> Quisiera verte una vez más <eos> Para decirte, que un "todavía", no tiene caso <eos> Si me tenías <eos>

Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> X2 <eos> We thought about love and that's sweet to me <eos> You say we got time and that speaks to me <eos> Now I'm all caught up <eos> 21 done and that's all my love <eos> Spent time wise, didn't waste too much <eos> Chasing the clouds <eos> Tryin' to rangle 'em down <eos> Now I'm all messed up <eos> You don't come 'round and that's just my luck <eos> I gave you all my love <eos> I thought you were the one <eos> I thought you were the one <eos> Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> Now I'm all washed up <eos> If we gon' drown then that's all my love <eos> Leaking out <eos> But my head's in the clouds <eos> Try to anchor me down <eos> Now I'm all messed up <eos> You don't come round and that's just my luck (luck) <eos> I gave you all my love <eos> Maybe we're just wired this way <eos> We just need to ride this wave <eos> I looked up one day <eos> And the sky was on fire <eos> Now something's running through my mind <eos> Baby, can we ride this wave <eos> Until we capsize? <eos> (Baby, till we capsize) <eos> Baby, would you run away <eos> If it ain't always alright? <eos> X2 <eos> 
Ain’t no doubt Jesus sees us <eos> Acting foolishly on American Band Stand <eos> Agog with spastic baskets, the latest fashions <eos> Here I am Here I am Here I am <eos> But that chin music sound, oh how it drown <eos> Gotta shake ‘em on down <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> Kill the lights and bring the music down. Everybody be quiet <eos> Sudden movement on the Serengeti, get ready Freddy <eos> Opportunity only knocks once <eos> Never mind the fat ones, just go for the slow ones <eos> See how they run see how they run see how they run <eos> While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake <eos> They shook you on down <eos> When the rain start falling, boatman calling <eos> Shake ‘em on down <eos> The flood receding, the mountain appears <eos> Send out the black bird, send out the dove. <eos> You Babel rabble-rousers <eos> In polyester trousers <eos> Big bright cities <eos> Ain’t no doubt Vishnu missed you, then Kali kissed you <eos> Better get busy. Better get busy. Better get busy <eos> Days get shorter, air gets colder <eos> Tune on in to the N.O.A.A. radio <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> Scaling up the heights of folly <eos> While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake <eos> They shook you on down <eos> When the rain start falling, boatman calling <eos> Shake ‘em on down <eos> While you busy lighting roman candles on the yellowcake <eos> They shook you on down <eos> When the rain start falling, boatman calling <eos> Shake ‘em on down <eos> The flood receding, the mountain appears <eos> Send out the black bird, send out the dove <eos> 
This year's love had better last <eos> Heaven knows it's high time <eos> I've been waiting on my own <eos> Too long <eos> And when you hold me like you do <eos> It feels so right, oh now <eos> I start to forget how my heart gets torn <eos> When that hurt gets thrown <eos> Feeling like you can't go on <eos> Turning circles and time again <eos> Cut like a knife, oh now <eos> If ya love me got to know <eos> For sure <eos> 'Cause it takes something more this time <eos> Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now <eos> Before I open up my arms and fall <eos> Losing all control <eos> Every dream inside my soul <eos> When ya kiss me on that midnight street <eos> Sweep me off my feet <eos> Singing ain't this life so sweet <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> 'Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn <eos> When that hurt gets thrown <eos> Don't ya know this life goes on <eos> Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street <eos> Sweep me off my feet <eos> Singing ain't this life so sweet <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> This year's love it better last ooh, ah yeah <eos> This year's love it better last <eos> 
Transport, motorways and tram lines <eos> Starting and then stopping, taking off and landing <eos> The emptiest of feelings, disappointed people, clinging on <eos> To bottles 'cause when it comes it's so, so, so disappointing <eos> Let down and hanging around <eos> Crushed like a bug in the ground <eos> I say let down and hanging around <eos> Shell smashed, juices flowing, wings twitch, legs are going <eos> Don't get sentimental, don't, it always ends up drivel <eos> One day, one day, I am gonna, I am gonna grow wings, a chemical reaction <eos> Hysterical and useless, hysterical and <eos> Let down and hanging around <eos> Crushed like a bug in the ground <eos> I say let down and hanging around <eos> Let down and hanging, let down and hanging, let down and hanging <eos> You know, you know where you are with, you know where you are with <eos> Floor collapsing, falling, bouncing back <eos> One day, one day, I am gonna grow wings, it's a chemical reaction <eos> Hysterical and useless <eos> I say let down and hanging around <eos> Crushed, crushed like a bug in the ground <eos> Let down and hanging around <eos>

Contemplating what's gonna be <eos> Wondering which way to turn <eos> Lotta things left to be learned <eos> Complicating silly old me <eos> The things I hold on to <eos> Just let it go & see what it do <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we want to see <eos> Just what we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> Fantasizing having myself a ball <eos> Staring up at the big screen <eos> Problem is I'm the only one <eos> Who's seen it <eos> Realizing it's not like that at all <eos> Time to come down to Earth <eos> & feel what it's really worth <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we wanna see <eos> Just want we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> 
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring <eos> Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun <eos> Now, the jingle hop has begun <eos> Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock <eos> Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time <eos> Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square <eos> In the frosty air <eos> What a bright time, it's the right time <eos> To rock the night away <eos> Jingle bell time is a swell time <eos> To go ridin' in a one-horse sleigh <eos> Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet <eos> Jingle around the clock <eos> Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> What a bright time, it's the right time <eos> To rock the night away <eos> Jingle bell time is a swell time <eos> To go ridin' in a one-horse sleigh <eos> Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet <eos> Jingle around the clock <eos> Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet <eos> That's the jingle bell <eos> That's the jingle bell <eos> That's the jingle bell rock <eos> 
I still sit around thinking <eos> Wondering what you've been up to <eos> And if you're happy now <eos> Sure looks like she loves you <eos> And the 'what could've been's' <eos> Are always what I come back to <eos> Like it's always been you <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> I realise, it doesn't do me any good <eos> To dream about the good times <eos> And a part of me knows it was the right thing to say goodbye <eos> But I lie awake at night <eos> I toss and turn and wonder why <eos> In hindsight <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 
Saturday night I was downtown <eos> Working for the FBI <eos> Sittin' in a nest of bad men <eos> Whiskey bottles piling high <eos> Bootlegging boozer on the west side <eos> Full of people doing wrong <eos> Just about to call up the DA man <eos> When I heard this woman singin' a song <eos> Yeah, a pair of 45's made me open my eyes <eos> My temperature started to rise <eos> She was a long cool woman in a black dress <eos> Just a 5'9, beautiful, tall <eos> With just one look I was a bad mess <eos> 'Cause that long cool woman had it all <eos> I saw her heading to the table <eos> With a tall walking big black cat <eos> Charlie said, "I hope you're able, boy <eos> I'm telling you she knows where it's at" <eos> Then suddenly we heard a siren <eos> Everybody started to run <eos> A-jumping out of doors and tables <eos> Well, I heard somebody shootin' a gun <eos> DA was pumping my left hand <eos> And she was a-holding my right <eos> I told her don't get scared 'cause you're gonna be spared <eos> I've gotta be forgivin' if I wanna spend my living <eos> With a long cool woman in a black dress <eos> Just a 5'9 beautiful tall <eos> With just one look I was a bad mess <eos> 'Cause that long cool woman had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> 
Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos> 
Feels like we've lived a hundred lives before <eos> Together and then decided on one more <eos> Here on Earth where everything is cruel <eos> 'Cause no one knows that this is just a school <eos> For what it's worth, I'd die with you again <eos> A hundred more times multiplied by ten <eos> I hope I'll always have you in my mind <eos> So that I know to find you every time <eos> Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate <eos> Won't you dance here with me whilе it grows late? <eos> Put your head on my chest, that's your safе place <eos> We'll fall deeper in love every day <eos> From life unto life and for always <eos> I'll be there when you need me around <eos> When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree <eos> Baby, you'll have me <eos> Soul mate <eos> Maybe there's not a brightness in this dark <eos> Other than what is burning in this heart <eos> But if we fight to keep this thing alive <eos> Pretty sure there's no end to us in sight <eos> I'll follow you into whatever is next <eos> Or you can follow me, whatever's best <eos> First, let's dance the dance that lovers do <eos> Before we go to sleep and start anew <eos> Soul mate, soul mate, soul mate <eos> Won't you dance here with me while it grows late? <eos> Put your head on my chest, that's your safe place <eos> We'll fall deeper in love every day <eos> From life unto life and for always <eos> I'll be there when you need me around <eos> When night finally comes and the leaves have fallen from the tree <eos> Baby, you'll have me <eos> Soul mate <eos> I promise you that I'll find a way <eos> To give you hope, to keep you close and safe <eos> Keep you close, no matter come what may <eos> And then we'll sleep in endless shades of gray (And then we'll sleep in endless shades of gray) <eos>

I’ve been told to be a seer, one must be ruthless <eos> So, I’ve eaten the yellow text of Paul and Brutus <eos> The soothsayers came and went, now I believe <eos> To be reborn, we first must cultivate a seed <eos> Oh, spit it out <eos> Release that precious piece <eos> Of pebbled ash from your mouth <eos> That’s a working-class jewel <eos> Spinning round your hopeless head <eos> It ain’t for chewing on <eos> It’s for looking through instead <eos> You prefer the common stone to the pearls <eos> Under the plexiglass with the factory girl <eos> Who told her sister all about you <eos> Hanging bedsheets on the clothesline in the sun <eos> She keep you warm, she keep you fed <eos> Now you’ve gone and lost your bed <eos> On the doorstep of the sick and indignant society <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who watched night disown day <eos> 35 days after defection <eos> I am sat in the cheapest of rooms <eos> There’s an oil lamp defiantly snapping at the shadows <eos> I’ve had notions to start playing chess <eos> But the mice, they have stolen the pieces <eos> I have told them to start paying rent or they must leave <eos> I am writing my letters <eos> I am anchored in an arm chair <eos> I intend on shooting the postman <eos> When he passes at dawn <eos> I haven’t eaten for 13 days <eos> I’ve taken the form of a Bosnian beggar <eos> And I’m reason the preachers are screaming and shouting <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who would love to be remembered <eos> By the ghosts of November <eos> On St. Stephens’s Day <eos> In some minuscule way <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> I can’t get out now <eos> So here’s a postcard from Catalonia <eos>

Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind <eos> I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time <eos> But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah <eos> I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon <eos> After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you <eos> I really don't mind what happens now and then <eos> As long as you'll be my friend at the end <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> You called me strong, you called me weak <eos> But still your secrets, I will keep <eos> You took for granted all the times, I never let you down <eos> You stumbled in and bumped your head <eos> If not for me then you'd be dead <eos> I picked you up and put you back on solid ground <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite, yeah <eos> If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman? <eos> If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand? <eos> I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might <eos> Kryptonite <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
Letra de ''La Botella'' <eos> Aja aja wuouohh yeiyyee.. <eos> Mach and daddy (x2) <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera y me ha quemado hasta morir <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera es traicionera <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Todo lo que le brindé <eos> Le di mi amor y mi cariño también <eos> Lo que ella me pedía se lo daba también <eos> Un carro una casa y me preguntó por que por que <eos> Ella se fue con otro hombre <eos> Ahora de la paja solito me quede borracho y tirado <eos> Con ganas de beber y le dije al cantinero otra vez <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Todos los que han sido traicionados <eos> Y con la botella se han desahogado <eos> A la cuenta de 3 quiero ver todo <eos> El mundo con el coro one, two <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Hay algo que quiero decir <eos> Esto no me puede estar pasando a mí <eos> La chica que quería para mí <eos> Es traicionera es traicionera <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos> Pásame la botella <eos> Voy a beber en nombre de ella <eos>

We might kiss when we are alone <eos> When nobody's watching <eos> We might take it home <eos> We might make out when nobody's there <eos> It's not that we're scared <eos> It's just that it's delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> We might live like never before <eos> There's nothing to give <eos> Well, how can we ask for more? <eos> We might make love in some sacred place <eos> The look on your face is delicate <eos> So why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place you've known? <eos> And why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> Why'd you fill my sorrows <eos> With the words you've borrowed <eos> From the only place that you've known? <eos> Why'd you sing Hallelujah <eos> If it means nothing to ya? <eos> Why'd you sing with me at all? <eos> 
When I was a young boy, my mama said to me <eos> There's only one girl in the world for you <eos> And she's probably in Tahiti <eos> Or Maybe she's in the Bahamas <eos> Where the Caribbean Sea is blue <eos> We've been in a tropical moonlight night <eos> Cause nobody taught her 'bout you <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> Why am I hanging around in the rain out here <eos> Trying to pick up a girl <eos> Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears <eos> When there's girls all over the world <eos> Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere <eos> Underneath the tropical sun <eos> Pining away in a heat wave there <eos> Hoping that I won't be long <eos> I should be lying on that sun soaked beach with her <eos> Caressing her warm brown skin <eos> Then in a year or maybe not quite <eos> We'll be sharing the same next of kin <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> 
Sweetheart, I've been trying so hard to get over you, just simply can't <eos> 'Cause the love we shared through the years meant so much to me <eos> All I'm lookin' for is just a serious relationship <eos> Someone I can hold all my life <eos> Why don't you give me that commitment? <eos> Let's settle down, let's chill <eos> Don't be afraid of me, I know my love is scaring you <eos> But I promise everything will be alright <eos> Come closer <eos> Let me talk to you <eos> Let's chill <eos> Oh, oh, baby, hey, hey <eos> Let's chill <eos> Let's chill, baby <eos> From the first time I saw your face <eos> Girl, I knew I had to have you <eos> I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace <eos> Visions of your lovely face <eos> All my love is for you <eos> Whatever you want, I will do <eos> You're the only one I want in my life <eos> For you, I'll make that sacrifice, oh <eos> (Let's chill) <eos> (And let's settle down) <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's what I wanna do <eos> Just me and you (Just me and you) <eos> Baby <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Come here, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's all <eos> (Just me and you) That's all <eos> I'm so happy to have you here, standing right by my side <eos> Is it a dream (Dream) or reality? (Reality) <eos> If it's a fantasy, please don't wake me <eos> All my love is for you <eos> Whatever you want, I will do <eos> You're the only one I want in my life <eos> For you, I'll make that sacrifice, so, baby, let's <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Settle down, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's what I want to do <eos> (Just me and you) Oh <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill, baby <eos> (And let's settle down) Oh-oh, oh-oh <eos> (That's what I wanna do) I want to do <eos> (Just me and you) <eos> Come here, baby <eos> Come lay next to me <eos> Let's forget about the past and think about the future <eos> Let's get together baby <eos> Let's stay together <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Let's chill, baby <eos> (Let's chill) <eos> (And let's settle down) Settle down <eos> (That's what I wanna do) All in my mind <eos> (Just me and you) To do with you, baby <eos> (Let's chill) So, let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Come on, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's all I want to do with you <eos> (Just me and you) <eos> Forever and ever <eos> Ever and ever <eos> Ever and ever, always <eos> Forever and ever <eos> Ever and ever <eos> Ever and ever, always <eos> 
I tried to reach you, I can't hide <eos> How strong's the feeling when we dive <eos> I crossed the ocean of my mind <eos> My wounds are healing with the salt <eos> All my senses intensified <eos> Whenever you and I, we dive <eos> I crossed the ocean of my mind <eos> But in the end I drown <eos> You push me down, down <eos> All the shame <eos> When you called my name <eos> I felt pain <eos> When you came <eos> 
Guarded <eos> I've been broken hearted <eos> I don't know when it started <eos> But you're showing me where it ends <eos> Exciting <eos> Yeah we got perfect timing <eos> But also kind of frightening <eos> I've already let you in <eos> And I'll follow wherever you go <eos> I'm just hoping that you don't <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> I'm all in <eos> All inside my head now <eos> I'm too afraid to look down <eos> 'cause I'm already falling for ya <eos> And I'm tired of taking it slow <eos> I just wanna let you know <eos> That I'll follow wherever you go <eos> I'm just hoping that you don't <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos> Don't leave me low <eos>

Ah, aha <eos> Ooh, ohh <eos> Ohh <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Once bitten and twice shy <eos> I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye <eos> Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? <eos> Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me <eos> "Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it <eos> With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it <eos> Now I know what a fool I've been <eos> But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh) <eos> Oh, oh, baby <eos> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes <eos> I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice <eos> My God, I thought you were someone to rely on <eos> Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on <eos> A face of a lover with a fire in his heart <eos> A man under cover but you tore me apart <eos> Ooh-hoo <eos> Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart) <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave me away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears (Ohh) <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> A face of a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart) <eos> A man under cover but you tore him apart <eos> Maybe next year <eos> I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special <eos> Special... <eos> Someone... <eos> 
Nothing you can say can tear me away <eos> From my guy <eos> Nothing you could do, 'cause I'm stuck like glue <eos> To my guy <eos> I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter <eos> Like birds of a feather we stick together <eos> I'm tellin' you from the start <eos> I can't be torn apart from my guy <eos> Nothing you could do could make me be untrue <eos> To my guy (My guy) <eos> Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie <eos> To my guy (My guy) <eos> I gave my guy my word of honor <eos> To be faithful and I'm gonna <eos> You'd best be believing <eos> I won't be deceiving my guy <eos> As a matter of opinion, I think he's tops <eos> My opinion is he's the cream of the crop <eos> As a matter of taste to be exact <eos> He's my ideal as a matter of fact <eos> No muscle bound man could take my hand <eos> From my guy (My guy) <eos> No handsome face could ever take the place <eos> Of my guy (My guy) <eos> He may not be a movie star <eos> But when it comes to being happy, we are <eos> There's not a man today who can take me away <eos> From my guy <eos> No muscle bound man could take my hand <eos> From my guy (My guy) <eos> No handsome face could ever take the place <eos> Of my guy (My guy) <eos> He may not be a movie star <eos> But when it comes to being happy, we are <eos> There's not a man today who can take me away <eos> From my guy (What'cha say?) <eos> There's not a man today who could take me away <eos> From my guy (Tell me more!) <eos> There's not a man today who could take me away <eos> From my guy <eos> 
Starry, starry night <eos> Paint your palette blue and grey <eos> Look out on a summer's day <eos> With eyes that know the darkness in my soul <eos> Shadows on the hills <eos> Sketch the trees and the daffodils <eos> Catch the breeze and the winter chills <eos> In colors on the snowy linen land <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Flaming flowers that brightly blaze <eos> Swirling clouds in violet haze <eos> Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue <eos> Colors changing hue <eos> Morning fields of amber grain <eos> Weathered faces lined in pain <eos> Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand <eos> Now I understand <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they did not know how <eos> Perhaps they'll listen now <eos> For they could not love you <eos> But still your love was true <eos> And when no hope was left in sight <eos> On that starry, starry night <eos> You took your life, as lovers often do <eos> But I could have told you, Vincent <eos> This world was never meant for one <eos> As beautiful as you <eos> Starry, starry night <eos> Portraits hung in empty halls <eos> Frameless heads on nameless walls <eos> With eyes that watch the world and can't forget <eos> Like the strangers that you've met <eos> The ragged men in ragged clothes <eos> The silver thorn; a bloody rose <eos> Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow <eos> Now I think I know <eos> What you tried to say to me <eos> And how you suffered for your sanity <eos> And how you tried to set them free <eos> They would not listen, they're not listening still <eos> Perhaps they never will <eos> 
I'm taking out this time <eos> To give you a piece of my mind <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Maybe one day you'll be a star <eos> But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy <eos> 'Cause that's the way you make me feel <eos> I don't want no romance <eos> I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real <eos> I never said that I would be your everything <eos> But you know that I love you, baby <eos> And it's gonna be such a shame <eos> When you can start living with it <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Bright lights and big cities <eos> Don't go to my baby's head <eos> You know I love you, baby <eos> But you choose this life instead <eos> So just remember what cha momma told you <eos> Before she sent you on your way <eos> She told never ever be too clever <eos> To not see your own mistakes <eos> I'll be here waiting for you <eos> When you come off your trip <eos> And I guess I will always be the one <eos> To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> I'll be here waiting for you <eos> When you come off your trip <eos> And I guess I will always be the one <eos> To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby <eos>

Chorus x 1 <eos> It's been a long year wonder where you've been/ <eos> But all of this time you were there with me/ <eos> There with me now, you were there with me/ <eos> So when you make the table can you save a place/ <eos> And if the food gets cold, can you save a plate/ <eos> Save a plate for me, you were there with me/ <eos> And she said/ <eos> The front door stays open, and i know it ain't snowing/ <eos> But i'm kinda in the mood to see a christmas movie tonight/ <eos> … with you by my side/  <eos> And what do we feel like watching? Let it be Malculy Culkin/ <eos> And we're both home alone so i'm feeling like i'm lost in NY/ <eos> … with you by my side, you by my side now/ <eos> Verse 1: <eos> December 24, just me and the stars/ <eos> Reminiscing on the year, barely noticed it passed/ <eos> Not bad for the kid, who was the clown of the class/ <eos> Don't mean to toot my own horn, so I wrote you a card/ <eos> I'm standing at the door, see my cousin's arrivin'/ <eos> I'm visiting the home, where they still call me ryan/ <eos> Don't think this visits quick, they bout to be here all night man/ <eos> Mums on the phone, other hand on frying pan/ <eos> Standing with my old man, preparing the playlist/ <eos> Springsteen on, maybe some miles davis/ <eos> We spent the entire year working for payslips/ <eos> Me and my tunnel vision yeah just like them reindeers/ <eos> I told you one day I'll play festival hall/ <eos> I'll be on the same stage they saw Lennon perform/ <eos> Let me thank my fans now just for all their support/ <eos> When I make the radio, I'm bout give you a call/ <eos> Chorus x 1 <eos> Verse II: <eos> Yeah, a miracle on 34th street/ <eos> My parents put the presents out when we'd fall asleep/ <eos> I was 8, roller blades and a frisby/ <eos> Leave the game boy at home, I ain't taking it with me/  <eos> I remember as a kid watching carols on nine/ <eos> We can decorate the tree maybe give it some lights/ <eos> Ry be careful where you're stepping just don't walk on the vine/ <eos> It looks awesome from the window, still it took you all night/ <eos> Damn, I hoped my sister wouldn't get better presents?!/ But <eos> On the real, I couldn't get better parents/ <eos> Despite the discussions, despite all the fussing and fighting,  <eos> I ain't talking I'm just keeping it private/ <eos> One day I'm going make it I'mma buy you the world/ <eos> Picket fences and a house you'll have diamonds and pearls/ <eos> 'Cos it still trips me out people give me applause/ <eos> I do this for my fans, my fan base are like my based gods/ <eos> Bridge x 1 <eos> Ain't nothing like December Night's/ Hell Yeah/ <eos> I ain't religious, but Jesus Christ/ Amen/ <eos> I worked so hard and we're eating tonight/ <eos> And I can do anything if you're there by my Side/ I Said/ <eos> Chorus x 1 <eos>

Eyes, look beyond the beauty <eos> That lies before you <eos> And lips, say goodbye to her <eos> Though she adores you <eos> And legs, if you know what's good for you <eos> You'll stand up and walk away <eos> And heart, you'll stop loving her today <eos> If you stop loving her today <eos> You'll save yourself a lot of pain <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> You know the only way <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Today <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> You know the only way <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Today <eos> Ears, don't even listen <eos> To her tears as they fall <eos> Even though they make the loudest <eos> Saddest sound of all <eos> And arms, if you know what's best for you <eos> You'll let go right away <eos> And heart, you'll stop loving her today <eos> Today, yeah <eos> If you stop loving her today <eos> You'll save yourself a lot of pain <eos> Ah, ah <eos> 'Cause she belongs to someone else <eos> And that ain't gonna change <eos> If you don't wanna break <eos> Stop loving her today <eos> Just walk away, away <eos> Walk away <eos>

I never saw the end in sight <eos> Fools are kind of blind <eos> Thought everything was going alright <eos> But I was running out of time <eos> 'Cause you had one foot out the door <eos> I swear I didn't see <eos> But if you're really going away <eos> Here's some final words from me <eos> Baby, write this down, take a little note <eos> To remind you in case you didn't know <eos> Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go <eos> Write this down <eos> Take my words and read them every day <eos> Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away <eos> So you'll remember what I forgot to say <eos> Write this down <eos> I'll sign it at the bottom of the page <eos> I'll swear under oath <eos> Cause every single word is true <eos> And I think you need to know <eos> So use it as a bookmark <eos> Stick it on your refrigerator door <eos> Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel <eos> Where you'll see it for sure <eos> You can find a chisel, I can find a stone <eos> Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone <eos> Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go <eos> Baby, write this down <eos> 
All aboard! Hahahahahahaaaa! <eos> Ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) <eos> Crazy, but that's how it goes <eos> Millions of people living as foes <eos> Maybe it's not too late <eos> To learn how to love and forget how to hate <eos> Mental wounds not healing <eos> Life's a bitter shame <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> (Let's go!) <eos> I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools <eos> I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules <eos> One person conditioned to rule and control <eos> The media sells it and you live the role <eos> Mental wounds still screaming <eos> Driving me insane <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I know that things are going wrong for me <eos> You gotta listen to my words, yeah, yeah! <eos> Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become <eos> Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb <eos> Crazy, I just cannot bear <eos> I'm living with something that just isn't fair <eos> Mental wounds not healing <eos> Who and what's to blame? <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> I'm going off the rails on a crazy train <eos> (Hahahahahahahaha!) <eos> (Crazy!) <eos> (Gibberish) <eos>

Mm-mmh (Mmh) <eos> Oye, escucha lo que tengo que decir <eos> Ya no me quedan ganas de mentirte para no llorar <eos> Yo sé que ya es muy tarde pero <eos> Oye (Mmh), todo es cuestión de tiempo, ahora estoy bien (Ahora estoy bien, ahora estoy bien) <eos> Ya no me quedan ganas de dejar mis besos en tu piel <eos> Quererte fue mi error y ahora lo sé <eos> Porque al final del cuento sé muy dentro <eos> Que yo sin ti estoy mejor <eos> Te fuiste con el viento en un momento <eos> Y no llevaste este amor <eos> Porque eres tú, nunca fui yo <eos> Quien nos dejó <eos> (Ah) <eos> Conmigo siempre vas a estar mejor <eos> No intentes con un dedo venir a tapar el sol <eos> No intentes ser más fuerte que la paz y que el amor <eos> Porque este amor no está perdido <eos> Tú ya sabes que este amor nos encontró <eos> Por miedo a perderte y vivir solamente <eos> Pensándote más, sin saber con quién estás <eos> Yo ya no te sé querer, maldita inseguridad <eos> Por miedo a quererte y no ser suficiente <eos> La velocidad, tengo que dejarte atrás <eos> Tantas ganas de volver, tantas ganas de llorar <eos> Cómo te enloqueces por una persona <eos> Si ya van tres meses y tú no reaccionas <eos> Y aunque la razón te advierte, el corazón traiciona, woh-oh-oh <eos> Pero no hay invierno que sea para siempre <eos> Ya se fue un verano, ya vendrá el siguiente <eos> Y aunque la tormenta vuelva vas a ser más fuerte <eos> Porque al final del cuento sé muy dentro <eos> Que yo sin ti estoy mejor <eos> Te fuiste con el viento en un momento <eos> Y no llevaste este amor <eos> Porque eres tú, nunca fui yo <eos> Quien nos dejó, oh <eos> Nunca fui yo, mmh <eos> Oye (Mmh-mmh), te fuiste y no me pude despedir (Ah-ah-ah) <eos> Ya dije lo que estaba por decirte <eos> Ya no vuelvas más <eos> Entiendo que ahora estás mejor sin mí <eos> 
I pray you'll be our eyes, and watch us where we go <eos> And help us to be wise in times when we don't know <eos> Let this be our prayer, when we lose our way <eos> Lead us to the place, guide us with your grace <eos> To a place where we'll be safe <eos> La luce che tu hai <eos> I pray we'll find your light <eos> Nel cuore resterà <eos> And hold it in our hearts <eos> A ricordarci che <eos> When stars go out each night <eos> Eterna stella sei <eos> Nella mia preghiera <eos> Let this be our prayer <eos> Quanta fede c'è <eos> When shadows fill our day <eos> Lead us to a place, guide us with your grace <eos> Give us faith so we'll be safe <eos> Sogniamo un mondo senza più violenza <eos> Un mondo di giustizia e di speranza <eos> Ognuno dia la mano al suo vicino <eos> Simbolo di pace, di fraternità <eos> La forza che ci da <eos> We ask that life be kind <eos> E il desiderio che <eos> And watch us from above <eos> Ognuno trovi amor <eos> We hope each soul will find <eos> Intorno e dentro se <eos> Another soul to love <eos> Let this be our prayer <eos> Let this be our prayer, just like every child <eos> Just like every child <eos> Need to find a place, guide us with your grace <eos> Give us faith so we'll be safe <eos> È la fede che <eos> Hai acceso in noi <eos> Sento che ci salvera <eos> 
Maybe I met you when <eos> I was five years old <eos> On the seashore at a playground <eos> In an ice cream store <eos> Were we ever introduced <eos> Did mama make me talk to you <eos> Hey there, hello, hello, hello <eos> Did daddy tell me stay away <eos> It's not a boy you need today <eos> Okay, okay, okay <eos> As we've gotten older <eos> Who could've known that <eos> We'd find each other <eos> Love's far away, far away <eos> But we'll move in closer <eos> Love's kinda crazy it's strange <eos> Suddenly it finds you, oh, oh <eos> So love wait for me <eos> I'll wait for you love <eos> I think I saw you when <eos> I was seventeen <eos> On prom night at that old ice cream store <eos> I noticed you across the room <eos> There was something more to you <eos> Hey there, hello, hello, hello <eos> I wonder if you know my name <eos> Or even if you feel the same way I do <eos> Now we've gotten older and who could've know that <eos> We were right there waiting <eos> Love's far away, far away <eos> But we'll move in closer <eos> Love's kinda crazy it's strange <eos> Suddenly it finds you, oh, oh <eos> So love wait for me <eos> I'll wait for you <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Wait for me <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love, love <eos> Love's far away, far away <eos> But we'll move in closer <eos> Love's kinda crazy it's strange <eos> Suddenly it finds you, oh, oh <eos> I'll wait for you love <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> Wait for me love <eos> Wait for me love <eos>

Trying to find a new home <eos> Trying to write a new song <eos> Trying to find a rhythm, that’ll help me <eos> Ooh, wanna get through it <eos> Hmm, keep singing the blues <eos> Everybody’s saying: <eos> “You gotta get a way in! <eos> Go deal with the real stuff” <eos> And I-I-I, it’s gotta be true enough <eos> Yeah, keep singing the blues <eos> Well, you know?! I’m just passing on <eos> Singing the same old song <eos> Sometimes it feels so right and I don’t feel all alone <eos> But when the music fades and the crowd drives away <eos> I’m starring at the mirror, yeah <eos> Singing the blues <eos> Ohh, staring at the mirror, yeah <eos> Still singing the blues <eos> I got a little up with reggae <eos> And I can lift and appreciate <eos> But I rather be high-old and <eos> Singing the blues <eos> Yeah, I’ve been in and out of soul <eos> Even rock and roll <eos> But a little baby blue play <eos> Never, never gets old and I realized <eos> Boy, I gotta have me some blue blues <eos> Yeah <eos> You know?!

Today seems like a good day to burn a bridge or two <eos> The one with old wood creaking that would burn right away on cue <eos> I try to be not like that, but some people really suck <eos> People need to get the axing, chalk it up to bad luck <eos> I know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored <eos> She’s always running from something, so many things ignored <eos> I might do that stuff if it didn’t make me feel like shit <eos> I’m on some old reality tip, so many trips in it <eos> Beautiful disaster <eos> Flyin' down the street again <eos> I tried to keep up <eos> You wore me out and left me ate up <eos> Now I wish you all the luck <eos> You’re a butterfly in the wind without a care <eos> A pretty train crash to me and I can’t care <eos> I do, I don’t, whatever <eos> I know a drugstore cowgirl so afraid of getting bored <eos> She’s always running from something, so many things ignored <eos> I try to be not like this, but I thought it’d make a good song <eos> There’s nothing to see, shows over, people just move along <eos> Beautiful disaster <eos> Flyin' down the street again <eos> I tried to keep up <eos> You wore me out and left me ate up <eos> Now I wish you all the luck <eos> You’re a butterfly in the wind without a care <eos> A pretty train crash to me and I can’t care <eos> I do, I don’t, whatever <eos> 
Sitting at the stoplight <eos> He can't be bothered by the heart cry <eos> Written on the cardboard in her hand <eos> But when she looks him in the eye <eos> His heart is broken open wide <eos> And he feels the hand of God reach out through him <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus, help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> There's silence at the table <eos> He wants to talk, but he's not able <eos> For all the shame that's locked him deep inside <eos> But her words are the medicine <eos> When she says they can begin again <eos> And forgiveness will set him free tonight <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> I said, God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos>

The cycle repeated <eos> As explosions broke in the sky <eos> All that I needed <eos> Was the one thing I couldn't find <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> The colors conflicted <eos> As the flames climbed into the clouds <eos> I wanted to fix this <eos> But couldn't stop from tearing it down <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Caught in the burning glow <eos> And I was there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let you know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> You told me yes, you held me high <eos> And I believed when you told that lie <eos> I played soldier, you played king <eos> And struck me down when I kissed that ring <eos> You lost that right to hold that crown <eos> I built you up but you let me down <eos> So when you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos>

Lovers, strangers. heart breaks, changes <eos> Every day things <eos> Been through it all <eos> Movies, cheap wine, claps and cloud nine <eos> All of this time <eos> I'm still longing for your love <eos> You woke me up in the middle of the night <eos> I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes <eos> So close but still so far away <eos> You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page <eos> I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways <eos> To close to let it slip away <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Bitter faces, holy places <eos> We left our traces <eos> Been through it all <eos> So forgive, forget, focus on me <eos> And all that darling <eos> I'm still longing for your love <eos> You woke me up in the middle of the night <eos> I knew that something wasn't right by the look in your eyes <eos> So close but still so far away <eos> You say we have a good run, but we're turning the page <eos> I wanna try it one more time, but go seperate ways <eos> To close to let it slip away <eos> {Chorus (x2)] <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Love you better <eos> So won't you stay?, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> Stay, oh baby stay the night <eos> I know I'll make things right <eos> I give you my word this time <eos> I'm gonna love you better <eos> 

Intro <eos> Oye, soy yo... <eos> Tu cuquito otra vez... <eos> Uufff.. <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Resistiré, yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré <eos> Te dije que yo sigo acabando... <eos> 'Si hombre <eos> Resisteré <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Yo resistiré, resistiré <eos> Yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré brother <eos> Resistiré etc etc.... <eos>

Loving and fighting <eos> Accusing, denying <eos> I can't imagine a world with you gone <eos> The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of <eos> I'd be so lost if you left me alone <eos> You locked yourself in the bathroom <eos> Lying on the floor when I break through <eos> I pull you in to feel your heartbeat <eos> Can you hear me screaming, "Please don't leave me!" <eos> Hold on, I still want you <eos> Come back, I still need you <eos> Let me take your hand, I'll make it right <eos> I swear to love you all my life <eos> Hold on, I still need you <eos> Long endless highway, you're silent beside me <eos> Driving a nightmare I can't escape from <eos> Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading <eos> Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones <eos> They took you away on a table <eos> I pace back and forth as you lay still <eos> They pull you in to feel your heartbeat <eos> Can you hear me screaming, "Please don't leave me!" <eos> Hold on, I still want you <eos> Come back, I still need you <eos> Let me take your hand, I'll make it right <eos> I swear to love you all my life <eos> Hold on, I still need you <eos> I don't wanna let go <eos> I know I'm not that strong <eos> I just wanna hear you <eos> Saying "baby, let's go home" <eos> Let's go home <eos> Yeah, I just wanna take you home <eos> Hold on, I still want you <eos> Come back, I still need you <eos> 
Come as you are, as you were <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a friend, as a friend <eos> As an old enemy <eos> Take your time, hurry up <eos> Choice is yours, don't be late <eos> Take a rest as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a trend, as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria (No, I don't have a gun) <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> 
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans <eos> Way back up in the woods among the evergreens <eos> There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood <eos> Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode <eos> Who never ever learned to read or write so well <eos> But he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack <eos> Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track <eos> Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade <eos> Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made <eos> People passing by they would stop and say <eos> Oh my, but that little country boy could play <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Go Johnny go, go <eos> Johnny B. Goode <eos> His mother told him "Someday you will be a man <eos> And you will be the leader of a big old band <eos> Many people coming from miles around <eos> To hear you play your music when the sun go down <eos> Maybe someday your name will be in lights <eos> Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'" <eos> Go, go <eos> Go Johnny go <eos> Go go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Oh go go, Johnny go <eos> Go, Johnny B. Goode <eos>

¿Qué está pasando? Se escucha en los radios <eos> Nos vienen siguiendo, parece que son contrarios <eos> Son varias trocas pero le atoramos <eos> Venimos mi compa y yo pero traemos buen callo <eos> Le puse al cuerno un cargador alargado <eos> Me eché un padre nuestro y casi me suspiré un gramo <eos> Por el espejo miré que se acercaron <eos> Tiraron varias balas, pero ninguna pegaron <eos> En ese momento, la neta, hasta me dio risa <eos> Ya sabían que no era ensayo <eos> Por el quemacocos salí tirando vergazos <eos> Traqueteaba el cuerno y en el vidrio les pegaron <eos> Ya mate a una, nada más me faltan cuatro <eos> Pisamos tierrita y ahí fue donde le fallamos <eos> Mi compa, bien loco, no controló bien el carro <eos> Y en una zanjita, fue donde nos estrellamos <eos> Traspasaban balas, se me borró la sonrisa <eos> Y hasta se me fue la vida <eos> Seguí echando guerra pero se me adelantaron <eos> Traía la pechera pero me la atravesaron <eos> Cuando abrí la puerta para bajarme del carro <eos> Mi sangre entre plomo y aún así le seguí dando <eos> Ahora sí en el cielo pido perdón por mis actos <eos> Me voy de esta vida pero no se irán intactos <eos> Tanta adrenalina, ya no sentía los putazos <eos> Bien Tony Montana por el pase que me ha dado <eos> Cuando menos pensé, no me respondían los brazos <eos> Caí al piso débil, la neta, estaba llorando <eos> Descansa mi cuerpo ya tirado <eos> Pa'l infierno a donde vamos <eos> Streetmob <eos> Rancho Humilde <eos> Lumbre Music <eos>

All their lives, I've been searching for the cure <eos> Please, how can I ever heal you from the pain that you endure? <eos> Why am I unable? <eos> Is it because I am the source? <eos> A seed over time can bear a tree <eos> That blocks the light from shining in <eos> I can feel the ground is sinking <eos> I can see you cutting ties <eos> I close my eyes <eos> I try to see the olive branch or the dove <eos> I ask the heavens up above <eos> Hey, why doesn't love conquer everything? Mmm <eos> I thought I heard you singing <eos> And all along, I guess I knew I'd pay the cost <eos> I was asleep while driving <eos> And when faith is blind <eos> You can't help gettin' lost <eos> I don't know what I was thinking <eos> I tried to let go for just a while <eos> But this feels like exile <eos> It could just be the alcohol and my blood <eos> It's rushing through me like a flood <eos> Dialing drunk to say <eos> "I love you more than anything," mmm <eos>

It's a mystery to me <eos> We have a greed, with which we have agreed <eos> You think you have to want more than you need <eos> Until you have it all, you won't be free <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> When you want more than you have, you think you need <eos> And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed <eos> I think I need to find a bigger place <eos> 'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> There's those thinking more or less less is more <eos> But if less is more how you keeping score? <eos> Means for every point you make your level drops <eos> Kinda like you're starting from the top <eos> And you can't do that <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, have mercy on me <eos> I hope you're not angry if I disagree <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely, without me <eos> 
You're tired now, lie down <eos> I'll be waitin' to give you the good news <eos> It might take patience <eos> And when you wake up, it won't be over <eos> So don't you give up <eos> We've got the time to take the world <eos> And make it better than it ever was <eos> That's what they'll say about us <eos> If I say a cliché, it's 'cause I mean it <eos> We can't walk away, we gotta get in between it <eos> And when you wake up, we'll grow together <eos> So don't you give up <eos> We've got the time to take the world <eos> And make it better than it ever was <eos> That's what they'll say about us <eos> I never said it would be easy <eos> I'm never giving up, believe me <eos> I used to think the pain would fade, but it never does <eos> You're tired now, lie down <eos> I'll be waitin' to give you the good news <eos> It might take patience <eos> And if you don't wake up <eos> I'll know you tried to <eos> I wish you could see him <eos> He looks just like you <eos>

(Clap your hands!) <eos> Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back <eos> Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hack <eos> It's early to rise, early in the sack <eos> I thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Well, a simple kind of life never did me no harm <eos> Raisin' me a family and workin' on the farm <eos> My days are all filled with an easy country charm <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle <eos> When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle <eos> Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> When the work's all done and the sun's settin' low <eos> I pull out my fiddle and I rosin' up the bow <eos> Kids are asleep so I keep it kinda low <eos> And thank God I'm a country boy <eos> I'd play "Sally Goodin'" all day if I could <eos> But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good <eos> So I fiddle when I can, work when I should <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle <eos> When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle <eos> Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy, woo-hoo! <eos> Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels <eos> I never was one of them money hungry fool <eos> Rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine <eos> A lotta sad people think that's-a mighty keen <eos> Son, let me tell you now exactly what I mean <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle <eos> When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle <eos> Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy, yes sir! <eos> Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died <eos> And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side <eos> Said, "Live a good life, play my fiddle with pride <eos> And thank God you're a country boy" <eos> Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle <eos> Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle <eos> Taught me how to love and how to give just a little <eos> Thank God I'm a country boy <eos> Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle <eos> When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle <eos> Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle <eos> Wooh! Thank God I'm a country boy, yea! <eos> (John Sommers played the fiddle and he wrote that song!) <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> 
I mouth your name a thousand times <eos> But never could prepare <eos> To know exactly what you are <eos> The blissful unaware <eos> And every chosen memory <eos> Carves into my skin <eos> It slips with every fading smile <eos> Sinking further in <eos> And as I reach into the night <eos> Grasping for your connection in some way <eos> To find myself again <eos> There is more of this to come <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos> And as the red punches through the night <eos> Feasting on ambition <eos> Open to a multitude of light <eos> Pulling me down to the deepest core <eos> And as I reach into the night <eos> I'm grasping for you <eos> Aching for that imagined perpetuity <eos> Feeding me <eos> Feeding love, feeding rage <eos> I'm beginning to see me through <eos> My conscience, my existance, my all <eos> Flickers of feathers and swords in the new thrive <eos> I've been waiting for signals from you all along to dive <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos> There is nothing that I cannot be <eos> Without a way to separate the dream from reality <eos> 
Well I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> Yes, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> I said <eos> Brother, you know, you know <eos> It's a long road we've been walking on <eos> Yes it is,  yes it is, you know it is <eos> Such a long road we've been walking on <eos> Oh, brother, oh, brother <eos> And I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> I said <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Here is what I know now <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Oh, but you know I am so weary <eos> And you know <eos> My heart, my heart's been broken now <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> My mind is too strong to carry on <eos> Too strong, too strong to carry on <eos> But when I am alone <eos> When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone <eos> When I've lost all care for the things I own <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> You who are my home <eos> You who are my home now <eos> And here is what I know now, brother <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Your love now <eos> Well, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by now <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos> 
There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> As I look back over my shoulder <eos> All the stars are shining bright <eos> Just like the nights when I used to hold her <eos> She's out there somewhere under the lover's moon <eos> Lover's moon won't you shine on me <eos> I'm dancing with a memory <eos> Wish I may, I wish I might <eos> Have one last chance to hold her tight <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos> There's a lover's moon tonight <eos> Shining down on half of this world <eos> So many souls are in its light <eos> But for me there is just one girl <eos> And she's waiting, I know she's waiting <eos> I know she waits for me <eos> Under the lover's moon <eos>

The first time <eos> Ever I saw your face <eos> I thought the sun <eos> Rose in your eyes <eos> And the moon and the stars <eos> Were the gifts you gave <eos> To the dark <eos> And the endless skies <eos> The first time <eos> Ever I kissed your mouth <eos> I felt the Earth move in my hand <eos> Like the trembling heart <eos> Of a captive bird <eos> That was there, at my command <eos> My love <eos> And the first time <eos> Ever I laid with you <eos> I felt your heart so close to mine <eos> And I knew our joy <eos> Would fill thе Earth <eos> And last 'til the end of time <eos> My lovе <eos> The first time <eos> Ever I saw your face <eos> Your face <eos> Your face <eos> Your face <eos> 
From old Montana down to Alabam' <eos> I've been before and I'll travel again <eos> You triflin' women can't keep a good man down <eos> You dealt the cards but you missed a play <eos> So hit the road and be on your way <eos> Gonna board the Golden Rocket and leave this town <eos> I was a good engine a runnin' on time <eos> But baby I'm switchin' to another line <eos> So honey never hang your signal out for me <eos> I'm tired of runnin' on the same old track <eos> Bought a one way ticket and I won't be back <eos> This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away <eos> Break (guitar) <eos> Hear that lonesome whistle blow <eos> That's your cue and by now you know <eos> That I got another true love waitin' in Tennessee <eos> That midnight special is burnin' the rail <eos> So woman don't try to follow my tail <eos> This Golden Rocket's gonna roll my blues away <eos> Hear her thunder run through the night <eos> That Golden Rocket is doin' me right <eos> And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me <eos> Now from your call board erase my name <eos> Your fire went out you done lost your flame <eos> And this Golden Rocket is rollin' my blues away <eos> Break (fiddle) <eos> That old conductor he seemed to know <eos> You done me wrong I was feelin' low <eos> For he yelled aloud we're over that Dixon Line <eos> The brakeman started singin' a song <eos> Said you're worried now but it won't be long <eos> This Golden Rocket is leavin' your blues behind <eos> Break (guitar) <eos> Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl <eos> Let's rise and shine good mornin' y'all <eos> And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day <eos> When I kissed my baby at the station door <eos> The whistle blew like it never before <eos> On the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away <eos> 
So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> 
You and me, we used to be together <eos> Every day together, always <eos> I really feel that I'm losin' my best friend <eos> I can't believe this could be the end <eos> It looks as though you're lettin' go <eos> And if it's real, well, I don't want to know <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Our memories, well, they can be inviting <eos> But some are altogether mighty frightening <eos> As we die, both you and I <eos> With my head in my hands, I sit and cry <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts (No, no, no) <eos> Don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> It's all ending <eos> We gotta stop pretending who we are <eos> You and me <eos> I can see us dyin', aren't we? <eos> Don't speak, I know just what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> No, no, don't speak, I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> I know what you're sayin' <eos> So please stop explainin' <eos> Don't speak, don't speak, don't speak, no <eos> I know what you're thinkin' <eos> And I don't need your reasons <eos> I know you're good, I know you're good <eos> I know you're real good, oh <eos> La, la, la, la, la, la <eos> Don't, don't, ooh, ooh <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush <eos> Don't tell me 'cause it hurts <eos> Oh, hush, hush, darling <eos> Hush, hush, darling <eos> 
How do I get through one night without you? <eos> If I had to live without you <eos> What kind of life would that be? <eos> Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold <eos> You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave <eos> Baby, you would take away everything good in my life <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go? <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> Without you, there'd be no sun in my sky <eos> There would be no love in my life <eos> There'd be no world left for me <eos> And I, baby, I don't know what I would do <eos> I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave <eos> Baby, you would take away everything real in my life <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go? <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> Please, tell me, baby <eos> How do I go on if you ever leave? <eos> Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me <eos> Baby, don't you know that you're everything good in my life? <eos> And tell me now <eos> How do I live without you? I want to know <eos> How do I breathe without you if you ever go <eos> How do I ever, ever survive? <eos> How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live? <eos> How do I live without you? <eos> How do I live without you, baby? <eos> How do I live? <eos> 
Think about it, there must be higher love <eos> Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above <eos> Without it, life is wasted time <eos> Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on <eos> Facing our fear and standing out there alone <eos> A yearning and it's real to me <eos> There must be someone who's feeling for me <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> A good kind of love, want a higher love <eos> I will wait for it <eos> I'm not too late for it <eos> Until then, I'll sing my song <eos> To cheer the night along <eos> Bring it, oh <eos> I could light the night up with my soul on fire <eos> I could make the sun shine from pure desire <eos> Let me feel that love come over me <eos> Let me feel how strong it could be <eos> Oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh I said bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> 
Forward yesterday <eos> Makes me wanna stay <eos> What they said was real <eos> Makes me wanna steal <eos> Living under house <eos> Guess I'm living, I'm a mouse <eos> Alls I gots is time <eos> Got no meaning, just a rhyme <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause I like to steal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal <eos> I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be <eos> Feeling uninspired <eos> Think I'll start a fire <eos> Everybody run <eos> Bobby's got a gun <eos> Think you're kinda neat <eos> Then she tells me I'm a creep <eos> Friends don't mean a thing <eos> Guess I'll leave it up to me <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> Guess I like to steal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal <eos> I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be <eos> (Half the man) <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> Guess I like to steal <eos> Take time with a wounded hand <eos> 'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal <eos> I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be <eos> (This I feel as the dawn it fades to gray) <eos> Well, I'm half the man I used to be, half the man I used to be <eos> Half the man I used to be <eos> 
I'm in my bed <eos> And you're not here <eos> And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands <eos> Forget what I said <eos> It's not what I meant <eos> And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> You said you cared, and you missed me too <eos> And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you <eos> And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe <eos> And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if I'm someone I don't want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again <eos> What am I now? What am I now? <eos> What if you're someone I just want around? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> What if I'm down? What if I'm out? <eos> What if I'm someone you won't talk about? <eos> I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin' <eos> 
Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, I feel so down <eos> Oh, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, baby, don't care no more <eos> I know this for sure <eos> I'm walking out that door <eos> Well, I've been in town for just 'bout fifteen, oh, minutes now <eos> And baby, I feel so down <eos> And I don't know why <eos> I keep walking for miles <eos> And say, people, they don't understand <eos> No, girlfriends, they can't understand <eos> Your grandsons, they won't understand <eos> On top of this, I ain't ever gonna understand <eos> Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, don't feel so down <eos> Oh, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, baby, gonna be alright <eos> It was a great big lie <eos> 'Cause I left that night, yeah <eos> Oh, people, they don't understand <eos> No, girlfriends, they don't understand <eos> In spaceships, they won't understand <eos> And me, I ain't ever gonna understand <eos> Last night, she said <eos> "Oh, baby, I feel so down <eos> See, it turns me off <eos> When I feel left out" <eos> So I, I turned 'round <eos> Oh, little girl, I don't care no more <eos> I know this for sure <eos> I'm walking out that door, yeah <eos> 
Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> I'm trying to make a brand new friend <eos> And everybody trying to fight <eos> It ain't easy, it ain't fair <eos> Is the world so messed up <eos> Am I the only one to care? <eos> So much love that I'm willing to share, alright, yeah <eos> I've got it right here <eos> So many things that I'm trying to do right <eos> Trying to make friends <eos> But everyone wanna fight <eos> Matter how hard I try <eos> I just can't get it right <eos> Working from early in the morning <eos> Up until the edge of night <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> I've been so many places <eos> City from town to town <eos> Looking for a real good woman <eos> They all seem to turn me down <eos> I'm looking for a Louisiana girl <eos> To put into my placе <eos> So when I wake up in the morning <eos> Thеre'd be a smile on her face <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Ooh, belong <eos> And I'll tell you one more thing <eos> I'm used to dealing with doubt <eos> Should I be in the big city? <eos> You know my money's running out <eos> Cost too much for a hamburger <eos> And they want too much for fries <eos> You better not talk to the big leg woman <eos> 'Cause they want too much for the thigh <eos> I guess I'll go back home, yeah, go back home <eos> I guess I'll go back home <eos> Where a country boy belong <eos> Oh, going home, take it home now <eos> 
You don't need to pretend, know you don't want to be friends with me <eos> Don't get defensive, I don't mean to offend, baby <eos> I'm all you want, all you need, so I guess it depends <eos> Don't make me ask you again, again <eos> Plant rosebuds on my cheek, I'll blush like rosé wine <eos> And if you water them enough, I promise we'll be fine <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yеah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> Straight out of the '90s, definition of brown sugar <eos> Hand on your thigh whеn I am driving downtown with you <eos> Everything's right, soon as those bedroom lights get dimmer, dimmer, oh <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yeah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> You can have anything you want (Anything you want) <eos> Anything from you want from me is yours <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy (Crazy), yeah, I'm crazy for you (Crazy) <eos> Approach me, baby (Ah), I'm crazy for you, crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy (Crazy, crazy) <eos> You can go, go (Crazy, crazy, crazy) crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da <eos> 
I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I remember the times when we used to <eos> Sit in the park holding hands together <eos> I never should have gone away and left you like I did <eos> I thought you'd take me back, but I was just a little <eos> Bit late <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl <eos> On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you <eos> Tight <eos> Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way <eos> It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> My lonely days and my lonely nights, girl <eos> On the outside looking in, dreaming of holding you <eos> Tight <eos> Well I guess I've had my day, you let me go my way <eos> It's me who has to pay, "the loser" they call me <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> I, I was born a loser <eos> 
I still can picture him: his hands in his back pockets <eos> He wasn't much for words, but when the wise kids made a racket he'd just have to go downtown <eos> Throw his weight around before starting over <eos> "Say did you hear I've got a band? <eos> Some guys I know from L.A <eos> We'll own the Rio Grande <eos> I'll pay you back next Friday <eos> You know it sure isn't big, just some cats I dig <eos> They said they'd do the gig" <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out in the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun <eos> Not for the younger <eos> Oh Jack Daniels, I feel your hunger <eos> I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not <eos> I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot <eos> You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin <eos> Just a momento <eos> So sad you loved in vain <eos> My comrades lost in battle <eos> The music wars are done from London to Seattle <eos> We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over <eos> Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado? <eos> Oh Restless Shadow, out on the blue hills you're feeling hollow <eos> Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California? <eos> I should have warned you <eos> No place to go now but falling over <eos> Ready to die <eos> Now he's ready to die <eos> 
Love, it will get you nowhere <eos> You're on your own <eos> Lost in the wild <eos> So come to me now <eos> I could use someone like you <eos> Someone who'll kill on my command <eos> And asks no questions <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> I'm gonna break you <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> Your ass belongs to me now <eos> Are you a human drone? (Aye, sir!) <eos> Are you a killing machine? (Aye, sir!) <eos> I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand? (Aye, sir!) <eos> Your mind is just a program <eos> And I'm the virus <eos> I'm changing the station <eos> I'll improve your thresholds <eos> I'll turn you into a super drone (a super drone) <eos> And you will kill on my command <eos> And I won't be responsible <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> I'm gonna break you <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> Your ass belongs to me now <eos> Are you a psycho killer? Say "I'm a psycho killer!" <eos> (I am a psycho killer!) <eos> Scream it! <eos> (I am a psycho killer!) <eos> Show me your war face! <eos> (AHHHH!) <eos> You are a pussy! I said show me your war face! <eos> (AHHHH!) <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> I'm gonna break you <eos> I'm gonna make you <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> A fucking psycho <eos> Your ass belongs to me now <eos> I will break you, do you understand? <eos> I will break you, do you understand? <eos> I will break you, do you understand? <eos> I will break you, do you understand? <eos> (Aye, sir!) <eos> (You fucking psycho) <eos> Your ass belongs to me now <eos> Your ass belongs to me now <eos> 
I've been walkin' these streets so long <eos> Singin' the same old song <eos> I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway <eos> Where hustle's the name of the game <eos> And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain <eos> There's been a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Well, I really don't mind the rain <eos> And a smile can hide all the pain <eos> But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way <eos> And I dream of the things I'll do <eos> With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe <eos> There'll be a load of compromisin' <eos> On the road to my horizon <eos> But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know <eos> And offers comin' over the phone <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo <eos> Like a rhinestone cowboy <eos> Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know <eos> 
What would you say if you could say <eos> Everything you needed to <eos> To the one, you needed to? <eos> You flash like a setting sun <eos> You come around, I come undone <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> Just yesterday north of LA <eos> I couldn't help but think of you <eos> Every time I think of you <eos> You crash like a rolling wave <eos> You come around I lose my brain <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> (And you, and you, and you) <eos> I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go <eos> There are only twenty <eos> Six letters I can use <eos> Just to tell you I won't let go <eos> Don't you let go <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> (I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go) <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> 
Down here the river, meets the sea <eos> And in the sticky heat, I feel ya' open up to me <eos> Love comes out of nowhere baby, just like a hurricane <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> Lying here, underneath the stars, right next to you <eos> And I'm wondering who you are and, how do you do? <eos> How do you do, baby? <eos> Clouds roll in across the moon and the wind hollers out your name <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> {Guitar Solo: Buddy Guy} <eos> We never going to make that bridge tonight, baby <eos> Across lake Ponchartrain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> So batten down the hatch baby and leave your heart up your sleeve <eos> It looks like we're in for stormy weather, that ain't no cause for us to leave <eos> Just lay here, in my arms, let it wash away the pain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> And it feels like rain <eos> 
Paper bags and plastic hearts <eos> All are belongings in shopping carts <eos> It's goodbye <eos> But we got one more night <eos> Lets get drunk and ride around <eos> And make peace with an empty town <eos> We can make it right <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> Tonight will change our lives <eos> It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry <eos> We won't give up the fight <eos> We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs <eos> And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young <eos> And we'll feel so alive <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> All of the wasted time <eos> The hours that were left behind me <eos> Answers that we'll never find <eos> They don't mean a thing tonight <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos>

You're taking what you want right from me <eos> Wrapped up in so much <eos> Life is just the way you hold me <eos> You pick your miscellaneously <eos> Wrapped up in all the choices you're not giving to me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to  fill the empty spaces <eos> You're saying what you want right to me <eos> No filter on your mouth, we know you talk in your sleep <eos> Remembering the times they won't remember me <eos> Our nights melt into sequels, you sink into me <eos> I'm laying on the floor <eos> We're drinking 'cause we're bored <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of affection, a little bit <eos> Just a little bit, just a little bit <eos> Just a little bit of, oh <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> (One more time) <eos> Oh, I'm looking for affection in all the wrong places <eos> And we'll keep falling on each other to fill the empty spaces <eos> 
As the midnight moon was drifting through <eos> The lazy sway of the trees <eos> I saw the look in your eyes looking into the night <eos> Not seeing what you wanted to see <eos> Darling, don't say a word I've already heard <eos> What your body is saying to mine <eos> You're tired of fast moves <eos> You got a slow groove on your mind <eos> You want a man with a slow hand <eos> You want a lover with an easy touch <eos> You want somebody who will spend some time <eos> Not come and go in a heated rush <eos> Baby, believe me I understand <eos> When it comes to love you want a slow hand <eos> --- Instrumental --- <eos> On shadowed ground with no one around <eos> And a blanket of stars in our eyes <eos> Hey, we're drifting free like two lost leaves <eos> On the crazy wind of the night <eos> Darling don't say a word I've already heard <eos> What your body is saying to mine <eos> If you want all night you know it's alright <eos> I've got time <eos> You've got a man with a slow hand <eos> You've got a lover with an easy touch <eos> You've got somebody who will spend some time <eos> Not come and go in a heated rush <eos> Baby, believe me I understand <eos> When it comes to love you want a slow hand <eos> You want a lover with an easy touch <eos> You've got somebody <eos> Who will spend some time with you baby <eos> Not come and go in a heated rush <eos> Baby believe me I understand <eos> When it comes to love you want a slow hand... <eos>

Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone <eos> Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone <eos> Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town <eos> Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, no <eos> He had no money, no <eos> No good at home <eos> Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone <eos> And now it's <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline <eos> It kept his motor running but it never kept him clean <eos> They say he loved adventure, "Ricky's the wild one" <eos> He married trouble, had a courtship with a gun <eos> Bang-bang, shoot 'em up, the party never ends <eos> You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend <eos> And now it's <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Yeah, yeah <eos> "Accidents will happen," they all heard Ricky say <eos> He fired his six-shot to the wind <eos> And that child blew a child away, yeah, yeah <eos> Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Eighteen and life, you got it <eos> Eighteen and life, you know <eos> Your crime is time and it's eighteen and life to go <eos> Yeah <eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa <eos> 
I'm really on the ropes this time <eos> I've been fighting all my life for you <eos> I never should've said goodbye <eos> But maybe that's what stupid people do <eos> 'Cause you gave me peace <eos> And I wasted it <eos> I'm here to admit <eos> That you were my medicine <eos> Oh, I couldn't quit <eos> And I'm down on my knees again <eos> Asking for nothing <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Don't think I could forgive myself <eos> I'm sorry for the ways that I used you <eos> And I could care less right now <eos> But you know, you hurt me pretty good too <eos> Yeah, we made each other bleed <eos> And we tasted it <eos> I'm here to admit <eos> That you were my medicine <eos> Oh, love, I couldn't quit <eos> And I'm down on my knees again <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life <eos> Oh, thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh <eos> So wake me up when they build that time machine <eos> I want to go back <eos> Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me <eos> 'Cause I really loved you, ooh <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life ooh <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life, yeah <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life <eos> Thank you for the happiest year of my life <eos>

I got good at holdin' back, never gettin' too attached <eos> I got good at knowin' that I'd be alone on Frdiday <eos> I got good at tellin' me my Romeo was make-believe <eos> He's gotta be 'cause, honestly, why else would I be lonely? <eos> Who wants to keep on pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> Yeah, just to let somebody break it more <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> You said I got it all wrong, you could turn my heart back on <eos> And that you'll always love me like that classic Dolly Parton song <eos> You had no problem pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> I can't believe what I believed before <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> Nobody's kissed me in the pourin' rain <eos> No one could ever get this stubborn girl to change <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> Now I turn up every love song <eos> And I'm the first one to admit <eos> Never thought I'd wanna say "I do" <eos> Just look at what you did <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> You did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> 
Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Here's a little something <eos> I was born as a bastard, no father, no master <eos> A shadow in silence left searching for answers <eos> Put up for adoption and left with no option <eos> Another kid fostered to fester, forgotten <eos> Take a look into these desperate eyes <eos> As they’re cast into the wretched hive <eos> But I ain’t going down alone <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Lemme say this <eos> Now I stand as a father, to men with no honor <eos> Ashamed of the racists I used to call brothers <eos> 'Cause no flag can mean bravery <eos> When bloodied by slavery <eos> The rebel, a devil, disguised as a savior <eos> And the sickening feeling in the air <eos> Is the fear to speak that no one dares <eos> So will I stand here all alone? <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Live my life like I’ll die tonight <eos> Dream like I’ll live forever <eos> Live my life like I’ll die tonight <eos> Dream like I’ll live forever <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> I have roared at the world for years <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> Doesn’t anybody hear me? <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> This burden suffered, I’ve paid the cost <eos> (Is there anybody out there?) <eos> Not all who wander are lost <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody listening to me? <eos> Is anybody else scared? <eos> The paranoia drops me to my knees <eos> Does anybody feel lonely? <eos> Disconnected from the things I see <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos> Anybody out there just like me? <eos> I’m choking on these words and I can’t breathe <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody there? <eos> Come on <eos> Come on <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody <eos> Is there anybody out there? <eos>

Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea <eos> To the open arms of the sea <eos> Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me <eos> I'll be coming home, wait for me" <eos> Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered, hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> 
A clean up woman is a woman who <eos> Gets all the love we girls leave behind <eos> The reason I know so much about her <eos> Is because she picked up a man of mine <eos> Jumpin' slick was my ruin <eos> 'Cause, I found out all I was doin' <eos> Was making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, oh yeah <eos> Just making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my baby's love, uh-huh, mhm <eos> I took this man's love and put it on a shelf <eos> And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself <eos> When you needed love I was out having fun <eos> But I found out that all I had done <eos> Was made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, uh-huh <eos> Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To steal my baby's love, oh yeah <eos> The clean up woman will wipe his blues away <eos> She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day <eos> The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet <eos> She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street <eos> So take a tip, you better get hip <eos> To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough <eos> I mean, she really cleans up <eos> 
I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> 
Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Feeling Christmas all around <eos> And I'm trying to play it cool <eos> But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room <eos> "Let It Snow" is blasting out <eos> But I won't get in the mood <eos> I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's <eos> True love that he thinks of <eos> So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <eos> Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> I've been down this road before <eos> Fell in love on Christmas night <eos> But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side <eos> Now I need someone to hold <eos> Be my fire in the cold <eos> But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's <eos> True love that he thinks of <eos> So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy <eos> Santa, tell me if you're really there <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me if he really cares <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh <eos> On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh <eos> But I don't want a new broken heart <eos> This year I've got to be smart <eos> Oh, baby <eos> (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <eos> If he will be, if he will be here <eos> (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me) <eos> Oh, woah <eos> Santa, tell me (Santa, tell me) if you're really there ('Cause I really care) <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Tell me, boy) <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if you're really there (Santa, baby) <eos> Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year (If he won't be, if he won't be here) <eos> Santa, tell me (Tell me) if he really cares (Do you care?) <eos> 'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year <eos> 
Lights on the trees under falling snow <eos> You get a bit closer when winter's cold <eos> Now I can't wait till you're by my side <eos> All of the best gifts, you just can't buy <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> I wish we were kissing under mistletoe <eos> The stars on the sky just can't match your glow <eos> Now I can't wait till you're by my side <eos> We'll be warm by the fire all night, oh <eos> I wanna hold you while the bells are all ringing <eos> Want you to be here while the angel's singing <eos> Days are perfect when I got you near <eos> My only wish is you here <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> Wherever you are, you brighten the moon <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you) <eos> We could be outside dancing under moonlight <eos> Watching the sky roll over our heads <eos> We could be inside trying to sing the lines right <eos> Laughing until we fall out of bed <eos> So when I wake up on Christmas Day <eos> I hope the first thing I see is your face <eos> Wherever you go, you light up the room <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you <eos> Wherever you are, you brighten the moon <eos> I hope that you'll make it back home soon <eos> 'Cause it won't feel like Christmas without you (Without you) <eos> It won't feel like Christmas without you <eos>

I don't love her <eos> I tried to tell myself <eos> But you can see it in my eyes <eos> So don't deny <eos> I can't fool no one else <eos> The truth is in the tears I cry <eos> 'Cause... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> I told her I'd never fall in love <eos> But now I know better <eos> How does it feel <eos> I can't describe this feeling <eos> That came when I saw her last night <eos> She got to me <eos> I'll let you know the reason <eos> I saw her with another guy <eos> So... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> And if it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Maybe she'll take me back <eos> (Hey, girl, he's begging) <eos> I made a big mistake <eos> (Won't you forgive him, girl) <eos> Now I can feel it <eos> (He's never felt before) <eos> I really love her <eos> (You love her?!?! What?!?!) <eos> It took my heart <eos> To shatter in a thousand pieces <eos> Before I'd ever drop my pride <eos> (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <eos> Losing love worrying about my image <eos> Really helped me realize <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (On my mind all the time) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (She stays on my mind, mind, mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't, I can't describe this feeling that I feel for her) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (Stay on my mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> 
When a humble bard graced a ride along <eos> With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song <eos> From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil <eos> His army of elves at his hooves did they revel <eos> They came after me with masterful deceit <eos> Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth <eos> While the Devil's horns minced our tender meat <eos> And so cried the Witcher, "He can't be bleat" <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty <eos> At the edge of the world, fight the mighty horn <eos> That bashes and breaks you and brings you to mourn <eos> He thrust every elf far back on the shelf <eos> High up on the mountain from whence it came <eos> He wiped out your pest, got kicked in his chest <eos> He's a friend of humanity, so give him the rest <eos> That's my epic tale: our champion prevailed <eos> Defeated the villain, now pour him some ale <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> O Valley of Plenty, O Valley of Plenty, a-oh <eos> Toss a coin to your Witcher <eos> A friend of humanity <eos>

Penso che un sogno cosi` non ritorni mai piu` <eos> Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu <eos> Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito <eos> E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> E volavo volavo felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva <eos> Lontano laggiu` <eos> Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu dipinto di blu <eos> Felice di stare lassu` <eos> Ma tutti i sogni nell'alba svaniscon perche` <eos> Quando tramonta la luna li porta con se` <eos> Ma io continuo a sognare negli occhi tuoi belli <eos> Che sono blu come un cielo trapunto di stelle... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> E continuo a volare felice <eos> Piu` in alto del sole ed ancora piu` su <eos> Mentre il mondo pian piano scompare <eos> Negli occhi tuoi blu <eos> La tua voce e` una musica dolce che suona per me... <eos> Volare, oh oh <eos> Cantare, oh oh oh oh <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Nel blu degli occhi tuoi blu <eos> Felice di stare quaggiu` <eos> Ritorna <eos>

Voices, in my head again <eos> Trapped in a war inside my own skin <eos> They're pulling me under (Go) <eos> I've swallowed myself but the fever remains <eos> I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain <eos> If I showed you my soul would you cover your eyes? <eos> If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie? <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices, Voices <eos> As I walk through this valley of shadows and death <eos> I curse not the “wicked”, I praise not the “blessed” <eos> If I told you the truth, you’d beg me to change <eos> If fear were a currency, you’d own the bank <eos> Voices, In my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices <eos> I don't want to live <eos> So calloused and frozen <eos> Ugly and hopeless <eos> I don't want to live forever <eos> I just want to live right now <eos> You can't take me from me <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Head again <eos> Voices in my head again <eos> Baiting me in a war I can't win <eos> I can hear them now <eos> Trapped in a game inside my own skin <eos> And I don't know myself anymore <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices <eos> (They're pulling me under) <eos> Voices <eos> They're pulling me under <eos> Voices, voices <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> I keep it all inside because I know the man is everything but kind <eos> 
All of my friends finally convinced me to get out of the house <eos> To help me forget, to help me move on <eos> Then I heard you're back in town <eos> In a crowd of strangers and lovers <eos> Someone told me that you were comin' <eos> So I should probably go to bed (Ah) <eos> I should probably turn off my phone <eos> I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah) <eos> I should probably leave you alone <eos> 'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin') <eos> I'll be callin' (I'll be callin') <eos> Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said <eos> So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed <eos> So I don't undo the got-over-you <eos> That I took so long to find <eos> 'Cause all it would take is seein' your face and I'd forget <eos> So I should probably go to bed (Ah) <eos> I should probably turn off my phone <eos> I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah) <eos> I should probably leave you alone <eos> 'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin') <eos> I'll be callin' (I'll be callin') <eos> Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said <eos> So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed <eos> Before I question my decision <eos> Is it love?

Get off your sled and go to bed <eos> Don't you ever tire? <eos> Throw a bone, I'm finally home <eos> Curled up by the fire <eos> Snow is falling from the sky <eos> Like ashes from an urn <eos> Sweet dreams, my little one <eos> Now it's my turn <eos> Well, Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> Now, when I sleep I like to dream <eos> Of rabbits in the snow <eos> Jumping right into my jaws <eos> From their rabbit hole <eos> Take one home and set him down <eos> Right next to your shoes <eos> Wake up to a big surprise <eos> My gift to you <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We'd rather have chew toys than Yule logs <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> And Christmas is going to the dogs <eos> We're scarfing down the turkey and egg nog <eos> And things aren't looking very good, it's true <eos> So I'll just lay here and chew <eos> So I'll just stay here and chew <eos> 
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos>

I used to hear a simple song <eos> That was until you came along <eos> Now in its place is something new <eos> I hear it when I look at you <eos> With simple songs, I wanted more <eos> Perfection is so quick to bore <eos> You are my beautiful, by far <eos> Our flaws are who we really are <eos> I used to hear a simple song <eos> That was until you came along <eos> You took my broken melody <eos> And now, I hear a symphony <eos> And now, I hear <eos> A symphony <eos> 
I can see all the trouble you're in <eos> I can see that it's under your skin <eos> And how it's moving you (It's gonna change, it's gonna change) <eos> You are fighting, but no one believes <eos> In the person you're trying to be <eos> But is it worth it? (It's gonna change, it's gonna change) <eos> But you keep moving on <eos> Take another way <eos> Keep your head up high <eos> Chances come in waves <eos> Maybe we got to sit back and take our time <eos> Wait and pray 'til the stars align <eos> Be the calm right before the storm <eos> To come back again <eos> We got memories we can not erase <eos> We live nightmares we can not escape <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'cause we're meant to live <eos> We feel hopeless, and fall in disgrace <eos> We are restless, alone and afraid <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'Cause we're meant to live <eos> What has it turn to, breath in and look back <eos> Haven't you noticed, you're walking again <eos> Remember the ache that has moved through your bones <eos> Don't you feel strong with this fire in your soul <eos> You kept walking on, took another way <eos> Kept your head up high, chances come in waves <eos> We just need to sit back and take our time <eos> Just wait and pray 'til the stars align <eos> You were the calm now we are the storm <eos> To come back again <eos> We got memories we can not erase <eos> We live nightmares we can not escape <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'cause we're meant to live <eos> We feel hopeless, and fall in disgrace <eos> We are restless, alone and afraid <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'cause we're meant to live <eos> But you keep walking on <eos> Take another way <eos> Keep your head up high <eos> Chances come in waves <eos> We got memories we can not erase <eos> We live nightmares we can not escape <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'cause we're meant to live <eos> We feel hopeless, and fall in disgrace <eos> We are restless, alone and afraid <eos> But we fight, but we fight, but we fight <eos> 'Cause we're meant to live <eos>

I can see every time I look into your eyes <eos> You don't care a thing about those other guys <eos> Without words, you made me understand what's on your mind <eos> The rhythm of your body next to mine <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Ooh-ooh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Oh-oh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos>

Fuck... <eos> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road <eos> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go <eos> So make the best of this test, and don't ask why <eos> It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> So take the photographs and still frames in your mind <eos> Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time <eos> Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial <eos> For what it's worth, it was worth all the while <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life... <eos> 
Heading down south to the land of the pines <eos> I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline <eos> Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights <eos> I made it down the coast in seventeen hours <eos> Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers <eos> And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Running from the cold up in New England <eos> I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band <eos> My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now <eos> Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down <eos> Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town <eos> But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Walking to the south out of Roanoke <eos> I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke <eos> But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap <eos> To Johnson City, Tennessee <eos> And I got to get a move on before the sun <eos> I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one <eos> And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey mama rock me <eos> Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> So rock me mama like a wagon wheel <eos> Rock me mama any way you feel <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Mama rock me <eos> Rock me mama like the wind and the rain <eos> Rock me mama like a south bound train <eos> Hey hey mama rock me <eos> You can rock me <eos> Rock me <eos> 
Just to see her <eos> Just to touch her <eos> Just to hold her in my arms again <eos> One more time <eos> If I could feel her warm embrace <eos> See her smiling face <eos> Can't find anyone to take her place <eos> I've got to see her again <eos> I would do anything <eos> I would go anywhere <eos> There's nothing I wouldn't do <eos> Just to see her again <eos> I can't hide it, no <eos> I can't fight it, oh <eos> It's so hard to live without the love <eos> She gave to me <eos> Doesn't she know it? <eos> I tried hard not to show it <eos> Can't I make her realize that she <eos> Really needs me again? <eos> I would do anything <eos> I would go anywhere <eos> There's nothing I wouldn't do <eos> Just to see her again <eos> (Just to see her again) <eos> She brightened up my everyday <eos> Made me feel so good in every way <eos> If I could have her back to stay <eos> (Today) <eos> I've got to see her again <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> I want to see her <eos> (Just to hold her) <eos> Hold her, hold her, hold her <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> See her <eos> (Just to touch her) <eos> Touch her <eos> I would do anything <eos> I would go anywhere <eos> There's nothing I wouldn't do <eos> Just to see her again <eos> (Just to see her again) <eos> She brightens up my everyday <eos> Makes me feel so good in every way <eos> If I could have her back to stay <eos> (Today) <eos> I've got to see her again <eos> (I've got to see her again) <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> It would, it would, it would <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> Make me feel so good <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> If I, if I could only see her again <eos> (Just to see her again) <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> There's nothin' I wouldn't do <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> Oh, don't you know it's true? <eos> (Just to see her) <eos> If I could only see her again <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Every day, every afternoon <eos> Tried so hard <eos> But lost to God <eos> I thought you're my friend <eos> I'll guess again <eos> I look to the clouds <eos> God gives me a frown <eos> This time next year <eos> I'll be married <eos> This time next year <eos> I'll say sorry <eos> Jesus stole my girlfriend <eos> Jesus stole my girlfriend <eos> A smile and a wink <eos> Meant more than a kiss <eos> But I don't see the world <eos> Like you do girl <eos> We ate and we sung <eos> To glory and fun <eos> But Jesus is here <eos> He ate up our fears <eos> Ask a friend what to do <eos> I wrote a prayer and made it out to you <eos> Angels listened but they knew what was true <eos> Say our prayers <eos> Lift our hands <eos> Lift our hands <eos> Glorious <eos> 
I know your heart <eos> And I know your downfall <eos> Though we fell apart <eos> It was no one's fault <eos> I've gotta make you remember <eos> How hard it was to let me go <eos> Slow dancing with a stranger <eos> But I found somebody new <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes just like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Back when we started <eos> I was a fighter <eos> I kept my guard up <eos> But I took it down for you <eos> Oh, what a thing to do <eos> What do you tell your friends? <eos> The ones I'll never see again <eos> What are you filling in their heads? <eos> I found another ex <eos> Some temporary settlement <eos> To kiss the heartbreak off my lips <eos> She moves just like you <eos> And she tastes like you <eos> But it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Yeah, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Oh, it's always been you <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't let go if you love me <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> Don't move on, don't move on <eos> 
And I feel that time's a wasted go <eos> So where ya goin' 'til tomorrow? <eos> And I see that these are lies to come <eos> So would you even care? <eos> And I feel it <eos> And I feel it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> And I feel, so much depends on the weather <eos> So is it rainin' in your bedroom? <eos> And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray <eos> So would you even care? <eos> And I feel it <eos> And she feels it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> Where ya goin' for tomorrow? <eos> Where ya goin' with the mask I found? <eos> And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her <eos> Will she smell alone? <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> When the dogs do find her <eos> Got time, time, to wait for tomorrow <eos> To find it, to find it, to find it <eos> To find it <eos> To find it <eos> To find it <eos> 
I won't tell you I'm lonely <eos> 'Cause it may be selfish <eos> I won't ask you to hold me <eos> 'Cause that won't mend what's helpless <eos> There's not a thing I could say <eos> Not a song I could sing for your mind to change <eos> Nothing can fill up the space <eos> Won't ask you to stay <eos> But let me ask you one thing <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love with me? <eos> I can't float in an ocean <eos> That's already been drained <eos> I won't cry at your feet now <eos> I know my tears will fall in vain <eos> There's not a thing I could say <eos> Not a song I could sing for your mind to change <eos> Nothing can fill up the space <eos> Won't ask you to stay <eos> But let me ask you one thing <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love with me? <eos> No use wondering <eos> Why your change in heart has wandered <eos> So I'll ask you this question <eos> 'Cause it might help me sleep longer <eos> Oh, when did you fall out of love, out of love? <eos> Oh, when did you run out of love for me? <eos> Out of love (Out of love) <eos> Out of love (Out of love) <eos> Out of love with me <eos>

Going through the hills on a night all starry <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is come to bring us peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "Tell me, shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely <eos> On the way to Bethlehem? <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is come to bring peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely <eos> On the way to Bethlehem; <eos> But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies <eos> When I get to Bethlehem." <eos> Angels in the sky came down from on high <eos> Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying <eos> Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary <eos> Sleeping now at Bethlehem <eos> "Where is the new King, shepherd boy piping merrily <eos> Is He there at Bethlehem?" <eos> "I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly <eos> In the sky o'vr Bethlehem." <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings <eos> Is come to bring us peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "May I come with you, shepherd boy piping merrily <eos> Come with you to Bethlehem? <eos> Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle <eos> Is it far to Bethlehem?" <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is born in the stable yonder, born for you and me." <eos> 
A-hey, do it now, huh <eos> Yeah, hey <eos> Hey-ah, once I was a boogie singer <eos> Playing in a rock and roll band <eos> I never had no problems, yeah <eos> Burning down the one-night stands <eos> Then everything around me, yeah <eos> It got to start to feeling so low <eos> And I decided quickly, yes, I did, heh <eos> To disco down and check out the show <eos> Yeah, they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh <eos> 'Til you die, yeah (What?) <eos> Hear, hear, heh <eos> A-heh, I tried to understand this (Yeah) <eos> Heh, I thought that they were out of their minds <eos> Heh, how could I be so foolish, how could I <eos> To not see I was the one behind? <eos> So still I kept on fighting <eos> Well, losing every step of the way (Hey, what'd you do?) <eos> I said, "I must go back there", I got to go back <eos> And check to see if things still the same <eos> Yeah, they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy (Yeah) <eos> Play that funky music right, oh <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh <eos> 'Til you die (Yeah) <eos> Whoa, 'til you die <eos> Gonna play some electrified funky music, yow! <eos> Ah ha ha <eos> Hey, wait a minute, now first it wasn't easy <eos> Changing rock and roll and minds <eos> Yeah, things were getting shaky <eos> (Yeah) I thought I'd have to leave it behind, uh <eos> Ooh, but now it's so much better, it's so much better <eos> I'm funking out in every way <eos> But I'll never lose that feeling, no, I won't <eos> Of how I learned my lesson that day <eos> When they were dancing and singing <eos> And moving to the grooving <eos> And just when it hit me <eos> Somebody turned around and shouted <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'til you die, heh heh <eos> 'Til you die (Yeah) <eos> Oh, 'til you die, yeah <eos> Come on, let's go! <eos> (They shouted, play that funky music) Play that funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) You gotta keep on playing funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) Play that funky music <eos> (Play that funky music) Come on and take you higher <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, white boy <eos> Play that funky music right, yeah <eos> Play that funky music, honky <eos> Play that funky music right <eos>

I can still shut down a party <eos> I can hang with anybody <eos> I can drink whiskey and red wine <eos> Champagne all night <eos> Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine <eos> But when I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> I can kiss somebody brand new <eos> And not even think about you <eos> I can show up to the same bar <eos> Hear the same songs in my car <eos> Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard <eos> When I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin' <eos> How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in <eos> When I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> Ooh <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
Quizás te puedas preguntar <eos> Qué le hace falta a esta noche blanca <eos> A nuestras vidas que ya han vivido tanto <eos> Que han visto mil colores de sábanas de seda <eos> Y cuando llueve te gusta caminar <eos> Vas abrazándome sin prisa aunque te mojes <eos> Amor mío, lo nuestro es como es <eos> Es toda una aventura, no le hace falta nada <eos> Estoy aquí, tan enamorado de ti <eos> Que la noche dura un poco más <eos> El grito de una ciudad <eos> Que ve nuestras caras la humedad <eos> Y te haré compañía más allá de la vida <eos> Yo te juro que arriba te amaré más <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> La mañana nos traerá un canto nuevo de pájaros alegres <eos> Amor mío, así es la vida juntos <eos> Dos locos de repente <eos> Sonriéndole a la gente que nos ve pasar <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos> Poco a poco el abrazo <eos> Boca a boca, despacio <eos> Aliento y suspiros tibios, anochecer <eos> Tan enamorados que así <eos> La noche dura un poco más <eos> Viajar a tu lado en el tren <eos> Un sueño difícil de creer <eos>

Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos> Si este amor fuera imposible <eos> Un deseo, un delirio intangible <eos> Viviría en la rutina de vivir <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si el amor no es el remedio <eos> Para que esta el corazón en el pecho <eos> Para que existen las rosas y el jardín <eos> Si para mí <eos> Amarte me costara todo <eos> Y para ti <eos> Amarme no valiera nada <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Aunque el destino no lo quiera <eos> Aunque te mudes de planeta <eos> Te doy igual mi vida entera <eos> Te adoraré <eos> Si compartimos cada día <eos> Yo siendo el hombre de tu vida <eos> O siéndolo en mis fantasías <eos> Si este amor fuera posible <eos> Y el silencio fuera un cuerpo tangible <eos> Si el final fuera el principio para mí <eos>

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags <eos> I've come to know that memories <eos> Were the best things you ever had <eos> The summer shone, beat down on bony backs <eos> So far from home, where the ocean stood <eos> Down dust and pine cone tracks <eos> We slept like dogs down by the fire side <eos> Awoke to the fog where all around us <eos> The boom of summertime <eos> We stood steady as the stars <eos> In the woods so happy-hearted <eos> And the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> And as the old pine fell we sang <eos> Just to bless the morning <eos> Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags <eos> I've come to know the friends around you <eos> Are all you'll always have <eos> Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone <eos> Careless and young, free as the birds that fly <eos> With weightless souls <eos> We stood steady as the stars <eos> In the woods so happy-hearted <eos> And the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> We stood steady as the stars <eos> In the woods so happy-hearted <eos> And the warmth rang true inside these bones <eos> And as the old pine fell we sang <eos> Just to bless the morning <eos> We grow, grow steady as the morning <eos> We grow, older still <eos> We grow, grow happy as a new dawn <eos> We grow, grow older still <eos> We grow, grow steady as the flowers <eos> We grow, older still <eos> We grow, grow happy as a new dawn <eos> We grow, grow older still <eos>

Would it be a sin? <eos> Oh, if I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Oh, like a river flows surely to the sea <eos> Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be <eos> Take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> Oh, for I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Woah, like a river flows surely to the sea <eos> Darling so it goes, some things are meant to be <eos> Oh, take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Woah, for I can't help falling in love with you <eos> 
If you feel lonely <eos> I could be lonely with you <eos> Tell me, baby <eos> Why do you seem so blue? <eos> Why are we so complicated? <eos> Maybe love is overrated <eos> I'm tired of waitin' <eos> I was never good at sports <eos> Save the games for the girls on the tennis court <eos> Say you need me <eos> But lately, you feel unsure <eos> Come on to me, come on to me <eos> I need more <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> If you feel broken <eos> Promise I won't break your heart <eos> If you shatter <eos> I won't let you fall apart <eos> Why are we so complicated? <eos> Love's a word I've always hated <eos> I'm tired of waitin' <eos> I was never good at sports <eos> Save the games for the girls on the tennis court <eos> Say you need me <eos> But lately, you feel unsure <eos> Come on to me, come on to me <eos> I need more <eos> It always feels like <eos> I need more <eos> Jesus Christ, you're so confusing <eos> If we keep score <eos> Bet my money that I'm losing <eos> 
(How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do?) <eos> Bury me under this <eos> It's a stable doom <eos> 50 strings carry me <eos> To the smallest room <eos> Napalm flies through these lungs <eos> I will watch the flame <eos> We collapsed <eos> We stepped in all my traps <eos> And forgot the aim <eos> How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do? <eos> Breaking through <eos> Bury me under this <eos> It's a stable doom <eos> See me burn, self-concern <eos> I will not resume <eos> Dark veneer <eos> What comfort brought you herе? <eos> Are you glad you came? <eos> We collapsеd <eos> We stepped in all my traps <eos> And forgot the aim <eos> How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do? <eos> Breaking through <eos> How do I get back? <eos> How do we get back? <eos> How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do? <eos> How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do? <eos> How do I get back <eos> To never changing you? <eos> How do we get back <eos> What we set out to do? <eos> 
Uti vår hage där växa blå bär <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Vill du mig något så träffas vi där <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Kom rosor och saliveja <eos> Kom ljuva krusmynta <eos> Kom hjärtans kär <eos> Fagra små blommor där bjuda till dans <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Vill du så binder jag åt dig en krans <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Kransen sätter jag sen i ditt hår <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Solen den dalar men hoppet upp går <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> Uti vår hage finns blommor och bär <eos> Kom hjärtans fröjd! <eos> Men utav alla mej kärast du är <eos> Kom liljor och aquileja <eos> 
Tell me something, give me hope for the night <eos> We don't know how we feel <eos> We're just praying that we're doing this right <eos> Though that's not the way it seems <eos> Summer gone, now winter's on its way <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> Oh, I'll miss the days we had <eos> Loving, leaving, it's too late for this now <eos> Such esteem for each has gone <eos> Has time driven our season away? <eos> Cause that's the way it seems <eos> In the world of the speech that is new <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos>

Time goes slowly <eos> Walkin' through the city <eos> Like the reckonin’ <eos> I'm alone here <eos> And all this noise <eos> Static from the TVs <eos> And the telephone poles <eos> That won't connect you to me <eos> Does anybody know that I’m out here waitin'? <eos> Does anybody know I still call for you? <eos> Does anybody know there's a soul that needs savin'? <eos> Does anybody know you like I do? <eos> I didn't think so <eos> I didn't think so <eos> Nothin' like the hues <eos> Framed by the sun <eos> Like the colours in you <eos> They can hurt someone <eos> Shall I leave you alone? <eos> Is that what you want? <eos> These streets go on forever <eos> I could hone them in heaven <eos> Does anybody know that I'm out here waitin’? <eos> Does anybody know I still call for you? <eos> Does anybody know there’s a soul that needs savin'? <eos> Does anybody know you like I do? <eos> I didn’t think so <eos> I didn't think so <eos> Lady on fire <eos> Waiting it out <eos> One doomsday cryin' <eos> One great big sound <eos> Does anybody know that I'm out here waitin’? <eos> Does anybody know I still call for you? <eos> Does anybody know there's a soul that needs savin'? <eos> Does anybody know you like I do? <eos> I didn't think so <eos> I didn't think so <eos> I didn't think so <eos> I didn't think so <eos> 
Desperté algo marea'o con su sabor aún en mi boca <eos> Busco el encendedor en el piso entre to'a la ropa <eos> Pongo a sonar Coltrane, sé bien dónde desemboca <eos> Y de a poco despierta con el breakfast que le toca <eos> Desayuno incluido en la cama y la ducha <eos> Soltá toda esa rabia, se que tiene' mucha <eos> Salimos a almorzar y vuelta a la cucha <eos> No chance que me quede sin postre despué' 'e tanta lucha <eos> Babe, no quieras curarte, esto no tiene cura <eos> Vamo' a querer darno' hasta en la fuckin' luna <eos> Yo aún sin entender tu diabla y tu ternura <eos> A big shut-out pa' tu cintura <eos> Wow, babe, no quieras curarte, esto no tiene cura <eos> Vamo' a querer darno' hasta en la fuckin' luna <eos> Yo aún sin entender tu diabla y tu ternura <eos> A big shut-out pa' tu cintura <eos> Ven, ven, ven, dámelo <eos> Ven, ven, dale, quítamelo <eos> Ven, ven, ven, dámelo <eos> Ven, ven, dale, quítamelo <eos> Cuando te vi supe qué pasaría, ah <eos> Me has embruja'o, no es cosa mía, no, no <eos> Baby, yo a tu la'o soy una fucking reina <eos> Estoy en medio del caos y a mí ni me despeina, no, no <eos> Ya son más de las 12 (Ah, ah) <eos> Mi cuerpo está pidiendo roce <eos> Dímelo, dímelo otra ve' <eos> Papi, ¿qué queré'? <eos> Dime, dime qué tené', yeh <eos> Babe, no quieras curarte, esto no tiene cura <eos> Vamo' a querer darno' hasta en la fuckin' luna <eos> Yo aún sin entender tu diabla y tu ternura <eos> A big shut-out pa' tu cintura <eos> Wow, babe, no quieras curarte, esto no tiene cura <eos> Vamo' a querer darno' hasta en la fuckin' luna <eos> Yo aún sin entender tu diabla y tu ternura <eos> A big shut-out pa' tu cintura <eos> Ven, ven, ven, dámelo <eos> Ven, ven, dale, quítamelo <eos> Ven, ven, ven, dámelo <eos> Ven, ven, dale, quítamelo <eos>

Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> And since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought me some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss goodnight <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> And the fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> But as long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, and snow <eos> When we finally kiss goodnight <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really grab me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Oh, the fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> But as long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> 
You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos>

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom <eos> Holiday tables under the trees <eos> April in Paris, this is a feeling <eos> That no one can ever reprise <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What did you mean to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos> 
I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on <eos> I have screamed until my veins collapsed <eos> I've waited as my time's elapsed <eos> Now all I do is live with so much fate <eos> I've wished for this, I've bitched at that <eos> I've left behind this little fact <eos> You cannot kill what you did not create <eos> I've gotta say what I've gotta say <eos> And then I swear I'll go away <eos> But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise <eos> I guess I'll save the best for last <eos> My future seems like one big past <eos> You're left with me 'cause you left me no choice <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> Put me back together or separate the skin from bone <eos> Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone <eos> Tell me the reality is better than the dream <eos> But I found out the hard way, nothing is what it seems! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> I push my fingers into my eyes <eos> It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache <eos> But it's made of all the things I have to take <eos> Jesus, it never ends, it works its way inside <eos> If the pain goes on, I'm not gonna make it! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> All I've got, all I've got is insane! <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> 
La, la, la, la, la <eos> La, la, la, la, la <eos> I wrote her off for the tenth time today <eos> And practiced all the things I would say <eos> But she came over, I lost my nerve <eos> I took her back and made her dessert <eos> Now I know I'm being used <eos> That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse <eos> I know she's playing with me <eos> That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> We make plans to go out at night <eos> I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light <eos> This rejection's got me so low <eos> If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Now I'll relate this little bit <eos> It happens more than I'd like to admit <eos> Late at night, she knocks on my door <eos> She's drunk again and looking to score <eos> Now I know I should say no <eos> But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go <eos> I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb <eos> I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 
I cannot take this anymore <eos> Saying everything I've said before <eos> All these words they make no sense <eos> I find bliss in ignorance <eos> Less I hear, the less you say <eos> You'll find that out anyway <eos> Just like before <eos> Everything you say to me <eos> Takes me one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to break <eos> I need a little room to breathe <eos> 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge <eos> I'm about to break <eos> I find the answers aren't so clear <eos> Wish I could find a way to disappear <eos> All these thoughts they make no sense <eos> I find bliss in ignorance <eos> Nothing seems to go away <eos> Over and over again <eos> Just like before <eos> Everything you say to me <eos> Takes me one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to break <eos> I need a little room to breathe <eos> 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge <eos> I'm about to break <eos> Everything you say to me <eos> Takes me one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to break <eos> I need a little room to breathe <eos> 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to <eos> Break! <eos> Shut up when I'm talking to you! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up when I'm talking to you! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up! <eos> Shut up! <eos> I'm about to break! <eos> Everything you say to me <eos> Takes me one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to break <eos> I need a little room to breathe <eos> 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge <eos> I'm about to break <eos> Everything you say to me <eos> Takes me one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to break <eos> I need a little room to breathe <eos> 'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge <eos> And I'm about to <eos> Break! <eos> 
Lump sat alone in a boggy marsh <eos> Totally emotionless except for her heart <eos> Mud flowed up into lump's pajamas <eos> She totally confused all the passing piranhas <eos> She's lump, she's lump <eos> She's in my head <eos> She's lump, she's lump, she's lump <eos> She might be dead <eos> Lump lingered last in line for brains <eos> And the one she got was sorta rotten and insane <eos> Small things so sad that birds could land <eos> Is lump fast asleep or rockin' out with the band? <eos> She's lump, she's lump <eos> She's in my head <eos> She's lump, she's lump, she's lump <eos> She might be dead <eos> Ba baw <eos> Ba ba banana <eos> Ba baw <eos> Ba ba banana <eos> Ba baw <eos> Ba ba banana <eos> Ba baw <eos> Lump was limp and lonely and needed a shove <eos> Lump slipped on a kiss and tumbled into love <eos> She spent her twenties between the sheets <eos> Life limped along at sub-sonic speeds <eos> She's lump, she's lump <eos> She's in my head <eos> She's lump, she's lump, she's lump <eos> She might be dead <eos> Woo! <eos> Is this lump outta my head? <eos> I think so <eos> Is this lump outta my head? <eos> I think so <eos> Is this lump outta my head? <eos> I think so <eos> Is this lump outta my head? <eos>

No puede haber <eos> Dónde la encontraría <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> No puede haber, desgracia semejante <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> Con iguales emociones, con las expresiones <eos> Que en otra sonrisa no vería yo <eos> Con esa mirada atenta a mi indiferencia <eos> Cuando me salía de la situación <eos> Con la misma fantasía, la capacidad <eos> De aguantar el ritmo despiadado oh oh <eos> De mi mal humor, oh oh oh oh <eos> Y me faltan cada noche todas tus manías <eos> Aunque más enormes, eran así las mías <eos> Y me faltan tus miradas porque sé que están allí <eos> Donde yo las puse apasionadas, oh, oh <eos> Justo sobre tí oh oh oh oh <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que, aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más evidente <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más preocupante <eos> 
Verse 1 <eos> I wanna know when you first felt alone next to me <eos> Only now do I understand the reason that you had to leave <eos> Oh I didn't see the signs or read between the lines <eos> Now it’s obvious the things I should have said <eos> Should have looked you in the eye, give you more of my time <eos> But I was selfish, now I see what you meant <eos> Chorus <eos> So I wish that I held you, I do <eos> I guess I got complacent <eos> Now I'm alone just blaming myself <eos> If I knew that you needed me too <eos> I would have never let go <eos> Would have held you so close <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Verse 2 <eos> I wanna know when you first knew that you had to go <eos> It's been so long since our last kiss, I think back I should have known <eos> Oh I didn’t see the signs or read between the lines <eos> Now it's obvious the things I should have said <eos> Should have looked you in the eye, give you more of my time <eos> But I was selfish, now I see what you meant <eos> Chorus <eos> So I wish that I held you, I do <eos> I guess I got complacent <eos> Now I'm alone just blaming myself <eos> If I knew that you needed me too <eos> I would have never let go <eos> Would have held you so close <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Bridge <eos> I don't know how this happened to me <eos> How I didn't see what we had <eos> No, I won't forgive myself <eos> When I'll know you're not coming back <eos> Chorus <eos> So I wish that I held you, I do <eos> I guess I got complacent <eos> Now I’m alone just blaming myself <eos> If I knew that you needed me too <eos> I would have never let go <eos> Would have held you so close <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Put my arms around you <eos> Put my arms around you <eos>

Ah, aha <eos> Ooh, ohh <eos> Ohh <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Once bitten and twice shy <eos> I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye <eos> Tell me, baby, do you recognize me? <eos> Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me <eos> "Merry Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it <eos> With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it <eos> Now I know what a fool I've been <eos> But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away) <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special) <eos> Last Christmas, I gave you my heart <eos> But the very next day, you gave it away <eos> This year, to save me from tears <eos> I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh) <eos> Oh, oh, baby <eos> A crowded room, friends with tired eyes <eos> I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice <eos> My God, I thought you were someone to rely on <eos> Me?

Oh oh, oh oh <eos> Oh ooh, ooh ooh <eos> When the visions around you <eos> Bring tears to your eyes <eos> And all that surrounds you <eos> Are secrets and lies <eos> I'll be your strength <eos> I'll give you hope <eos> Keeping your faith when it's gone <eos> The one you should call <eos> Was standing there all along <eos> And I will take you in my arms <eos> And hold you right where you belong <eos> 'Til the day my life is through <eos> This I promise you <eos> This I promise you <eos> I've loved you forever <eos> In lifetimes before <eos> And I promise you never <eos> Will you hurt anymore <eos> I give you my word <eos> I give you my heart (give you my heart) <eos> This is a battle we've won <eos> And with this vow <eos> Forever has now begun <eos> Just close your eyes (close your eyes) <eos> Each loving day (each loving day) <eos> I know this feeling won't go away (no) <eos> 'Til the day my life is through <eos> This I promise you <eos> This I promise you <eos> Over and over I fall <eos> (Over and over I fall) <eos> When I hear you call <eos> Without you in my life, baby <eos> I just wouldn't be living at all <eos> And I will take you in my arms <eos> (I will take you in my arms) <eos> And hold you right where you belong <eos> (Right where you belong) <eos> 'Til the day my life is through <eos> This I promise you, babe <eos> Just close your eyes <eos> Each loving day (each loving day) <eos> I know this feeling won't go away (no) <eos> Every word I say is true <eos> This I promise you <eos> Every word I say is true <eos> This I promise you <eos> Oooh, I promise you <eos> 
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight <eos> Not a footprint to be seen <eos> A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen <eos> The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside <eos> Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I've tried <eos> Don't let them in, don't let them see <eos> Be the good girl you always have to be <eos> Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know <eos> Well now they know <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> Can't hold me back anymore <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> Turn away and slam the door <eos> I don't care what they're going to say <eos> Let the storm rage on <eos> The cold never bothered me anyway <eos> It's funny how some distance <eos> Makes everything seem small <eos> And the fears that once controlled me <eos> Can't get to me at all <eos> It's time to see what I can do <eos> To test the limits and break through <eos> No right, no wrong, no rules for me <eos> I'm free! <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> I walk with the wind and sky <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> You'll never see me cry <eos> Here I stand <eos> And here I'll stay <eos> Let the storm rage on <eos> My power flurries through the air into the ground <eos> My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around <eos> And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast <eos> I'm never going back, the past is in the past <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> When I'll rise like the break of dawn <eos> Let it go, let it go <eos> That perfect girl is gone <eos> Here I stand <eos> In the light of day <eos> Let the storm rage on <eos> The cold never bothered me anyway <eos> 
Son las cinco de la mañana <eos> Escuché que te levantabas <eos> Se cierra la puerta y ya sé que <eos> Me quedé solo otra vez <eos> No pasa nada <eos> El amor antes no importaba <eos> Pero hay algo que siento esta vez <eos> Y sé que mañana voy a querer <eos> Llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> No sé lo que puedas pensar <eos> Que te quеdes a dormir, pero hasta la mañana <eos> Que еsta vez no te vayas en medio de la madrugada <eos> Que te queda tan bonito el amanecer en la cara <eos> Te ves tan linda con eso, pero mejor sin nada <eos> Y marco tu número <eos> Que nunca voy a olvidar <eos> Tu voz sabrosa me tiene loco <eos> Que marco un cinco y me vuelvo un ocho <eos> Y marco tu número <eos> Que nunca voy a olvidar <eos> No le des a rechazar, ni se te ocurra <eos> Que no me voy a tardar en <eos> Llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> No sé lo que puedas pensar <eos> Voy a querer llamarte <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> Si quieres salir a pasear <eos> Que ya me empezaste a gustar (me empezaste a gustar) <eos> Voy a querer llamarte (oh, no) <eos> Para preguntarte <eos> ¿Qué tal si cambiamos el plan? <eos> Que siempre te vas <eos> Son las cinco de la mañana <eos> Escuché que te levantabas <eos> Se cierra la puerta y ya sé que <eos> Me quedé solo otra vez <eos> 
Vuélveme a querer <eos> Yo solo pido tiempo para hablar <eos> Mentirse por orgullo no esta bien <eos> Juramos no rendirnos sin luchar <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> No quieras esconderte la verdad <eos> Herirse por amor nunca es perder <eos> Y amar es ser capaz con la verdad <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Yo solo te prometo darte amor <eos> Por dentro sabes que no esta bien <eos> Te juro que conmigo estas mejor <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Aún quedan mil canciones por cantar <eos> Tenemos muchas cosas que aprender <eos> La vida va enseñarnos a volar <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Entiende que ya se pedir perdón <eos> Perdóname que todo va estar bien <eos> Y yo voy a sanar tu corazón <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Si lloro no es por culpa es por amor <eos> Fui ciega pero ya lo puedo ver <eos> Que amar nunca se rima con dolor <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Yo solo te prometo darte amor <eos> Por dentro sabes que no esta bien <eos> Te juro que conmigo estas mejor <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Aún quedan mil canciones por cantar <eos> Tenemos muchas cosas que aprender <eos> La vida va enseñarnos a volar <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Entiende que ya se pedir perdón <eos> Perdóname que todo va estar bien <eos> Y yo voy a sanar tu corazón <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Yo solo pido tiempo para hablar <eos> Mentirse por orgullo no esta bien <eos> Juramos no rendirnos sin luchar <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos> Entiende que ya se pedir perdón <eos> Perdóname que todo va estar bien <eos> Y yo voy a sanar tu corazón <eos> Vuélveme a querer <eos>

I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos>

Estoy enamorado de ti <eos> Cuando suspiro, lo hago por ti <eos> Tú me robaste el corazón <eos> Con la magia de tus besos <eos> Eres mi centro de gravedad <eos> Tú lo tienes todo no te falta nada <eos> Déjame encontrarte otra vez <eos> Déjame tocarte como debe ser <eos> Tú haces que me de cosquillas el amor <eos> Tú haces que en la vida brille todo <eos> Eres mi centro gravitacional <eos> Daría todo porque me besaras <eos> Tienes todo lo que quiero mami <eos> Esos labiecitos rojos yo lo quiero pa' mí <eos> Sabes lo que siento, te lo advertí <eos> Mirándote a los ojos no te voy a mentir <eos> Si no fuera suficientemente, tú sabes que me muero por ti <eos> Tú haces que me de cosquillas el amor <eos> Tú haces que en la vida brille todo <eos> Eres mi centro gravitacional <eos> Daría todo porque me besaras <eos> Tú haces que me de cosquillas el amor <eos> Tú haces que en la vida brille todo <eos> Eres mi centro gravitacional <eos> Daría todo porque me besaras <eos> Tú no eres de aquí, tú lo tienes todo quiero repetir <eos> Tráiganmela una vez más <eos> Daría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Tú haces que me de cosquillas el amor <eos> Tú haces que en la vida brille todo <eos> Eres mi centro gravitacional <eos> Daría todo porque me besaras <eos> Tú haces que me de cosquillas el amor <eos> Tú haces que en la vida brille todo <eos> Eres mi centro gravitacional <eos> Daría todo porque me besaras <eos>

It's sad we're not together, but I wish happiness for you <eos> I know we said forever, love don't always make it through <eos> Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way <eos> We opened up the same book, we found a different page <eos> 'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities <eos> And priorities ain't the same <eos> The harmony, it's the only thing I can save <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well) <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well) <eos> 'Cause honestly your loyalties, insecurities <eos> And priorities ain't the same <eos> The harmony, it's the only thing I can save <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well <eos> (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you) <eos> I wish you well <eos> I wish you well <eos> I hope that you remember, that I was always good to you <eos> And even though you hurt me, ah, I just had to see it through <eos> Sometimes, even the good things get lost along the way <eos> I had to let you go, but I wanted you to stay <eos> 'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities <eos> And priorities ain't the same <eos> The harmony, it's the only thing I can save <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well (I wish you well, I wish you well) <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well <eos> 'Cause honestly, your loyalties, insecurities <eos> And priorities ain't the same <eos> The harmony, it's the only thing I can save <eos> I wish you well, I wish you well <eos> (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well) <eos> Wish you well, I wish you well, I <eos> Wish you well, I wish you well, I <eos> Wish you well, I wish you well, I <eos> Wish you well, I <eos> I wish you well <eos> I wish you well, oh oh <eos> I wish, I wish (I wish you well) <eos> (I wish you, I wish you, I wish you well) <eos>

I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> 
Silent night, holy night <eos> All is calm, all is bright <eos> Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child <eos> Holy Infant so tender and mild <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> Sleep in heavenly peace <eos> Silent night, holy night <eos> Shepherds quake at the sight <eos> Glories stream from heaven afar <eos> Heavenly hosts sing 'Alleluia! <eos> Christ the Savior is born <eos> Christ the Savior is born <eos> Christ the Savior is born <eos> 
Thanks for the times that you've given me <eos> The memories are all in my mind <eos> And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow <eos> There's something I must say out loud <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> You shared my dreams <eos> My joys <eos> My pains <eos> You made my life worth living for <eos> And if I had to live my life over again, dear <eos> I'd spend each and every moment with you <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> When we are together <eos> The moments I cherish <eos> With every beat of my heart <eos> To touch you <eos> To hold you <eos> To feel you <eos> To need you <eos> There's nothing to keep us apart <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> You're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> Yes, you're once <eos> Twice <eos> Three times a lady <eos> And I love you <eos> I love you <eos> 
Oooh oooh <eos> Oooh oooh <eos> I've been afraid, been alone, been undone <eos> I've been on fire, flyin' high as the sun <eos> In a world where things come and go <eos> The only thing I've ever known is true <eos> Oh, is you <eos> I've been the prince, I've been the pauper <eos> Been the star and played the fool <eos> Been the winner and the loser <eos> In between them, too <eos> But no matter who I might become <eos> Or who I've been before <eos> I will always be <eos> I will always be yours <eos> Oooh oooh (always be yours) <eos> Oooh oooh <eos> I'd run through flames, push back fate, break down walls <eos> I'd give my heart, give my breath, give it all <eos> In a world where things come and go <eos> The only thing I can't afford to lose <eos> Oh, is you <eos> I've been the prince, I've been the pauper <eos> Been the star and played the fool <eos> Been the winner and the loser <eos> In between them, too <eos> But no matter who I might become <eos> Or who I've been before <eos> I will always be <eos> I will always be yours <eos> Oooh oooh (I'm gonna be yours, yeah) <eos> Oooh oooh (I will always be yours) <eos> Oooh oooh <eos> Oooh oooh <eos> In a world where things come and go <eos> The only thing I've ever known is true <eos> Oh, is you <eos> I've been the prince, I've been the pauper <eos> Been the star and played the fool <eos> Been the winner and the loser <eos> In between them, too <eos> But no matter who I might become <eos> Or who I've been before <eos> I will always be <eos> I will always be yours <eos> Oooh oooh (I will always be yours) <eos> Oooh oooh (I will always be yours) <eos> Oooh oooh (Always be yours) <eos> Oooh oooh (I will always be yours) <eos>

Trapped in purgatory <eos> A lifeless object, alive <eos> Awaiting reprisal <eos> Death will be their acquittance <eos> The sky is turning red <eos> Return to power draws near <eos> Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears <eos> Abolish the rules made of stone <eos> Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past <eos> Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above <eos> Awaiting the hour of reprisal <eos> Your time slips away <eos> Raining blood <eos> From a lacerated sky <eos> Bleeding its horror <eos> Creating my structure <eos> Now, I shall reign in blood <eos> 
This was never the way I planned <eos> Not my intention <eos> I got so brave, drink in hand <eos> Lost my discretion <eos> It's not what I'm used to <eos> Just wanna try you on <eos> I'm curious for you <eos> Caught my attention <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos> No, I don't even know your name <eos> It doesn't matter <eos> You're my experimental game <eos> Just human nature <eos> It's not what good girls do <eos> Not how they should behave <eos> My head gets so confused <eos> Hard to obey <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos> Us girls, we are so magical <eos> Soft skin, red lips, so kissable <eos> Hard to resist, so touchable <eos> Too good to deny it <eos> Ain't no big deal, it's innocent <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> The taste of her cherry chapstick <eos> I kissed a girl just to try it <eos> I hope my boyfriend don't mind it <eos> It felt so wrong, it felt so right <eos> Don't mean I'm in love tonight <eos> I kissed a girl and I liked it <eos> I liked it <eos>

I fall to pieces <eos> Each time I see you again <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> How can I be just your friend? <eos> You want me to act like we've never kissed <eos> You want me to forget (to forget) <eos> Pretend we've never met (never met) <eos> And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name) <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Time only adds to the flame <eos> You tell me to find someone else to love <eos> Someone who'll love me too (love me too) <eos> The way you used to do (used to do) <eos> But each time I go out with someone new <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> 
I don't ever look back <eos> No you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> So don't think twice because <eos> I ain't afraid of the slow burn <eos> And one thing's for sure <eos> It's good to make a good thing last <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Take ahold of my hand <eos> I'm gonna love you <eos> Slow like the hourglass sand <eos> God knows, I've spent a lifetime of lonely wanderin' <eos> But I'm all in for good <eos> I wanna be your man <eos> So girl, don't worry <eos> This boy ain't gonna run <eos> There ain't no hurry <eos> We got plenty of days left under the sun <eos> No, it ain't a one day ride <eos> It's up through the mountains where the coyotes cry <eos> Down through the canyon where the wild things hide <eos> And the cottonwoods fall <eos> Feel the river underneath our feet <eos> We'll be drowning in a sagebrush sea <eos> Long as I know that it's you and me <eos> Time don't matter at all <eos> Girl, I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> Girl, I'm in it till the end <eos> Forever and again <eos> I'm in it for the long haul <eos> I don't ever look back <eos> No, you never gotta <eos> Worry 'bout things like that <eos> 
Mira, si la vida fuera fácil, yo tendría mil amores más <eos> Y tú seguro tendrías otro que te haga suspirar <eos> Mira, si los días no contaran no tendría que dejarte atrás <eos> Pero es tarde, ya es muy tarde y esto duele <eos> Me debo ir (Me debo ir) <eos> No me quiero ir (Cómo decir) <eos> Me tengo que ir (Nunca mirar atrás) <eos> No quiero partir (Yo de ti me enamoré) <eos> Debo alejar- (-me, eh) <eos> Tengo que cambiar- (-te, eh) <eos> Tengo quе soñar, tú tienes que soñar <eos> Y dеbemos llegar <eos> Y aunque dijimos adiós, nunca dijimos adiós <eos> Cuando me pides perdón, te pido perdón <eos> Tanta luz que apagó <eos> Y estoy seguro que dos no sobreviven con sólo un corazón <eos> Para abrazarnos, para mirarnos, para perdernos (Y recuperarnos) <eos> Tanto, duele tanto la vida sin ti <eos> Duele tanto que te puedo decir <eos> Duele tanto que no quiero vivir <eos> ¿Será que está mal decirlo? <eos> Pienso que de pronto yo no soy para ti <eos> Pienso que quizás te olvidaste de mí <eos> Y así es fácil cuando sueñas otra vez <eos> La gente está gritando en la calle <eos> La gente está diciendo no pares <eos> No pares, no pares <eos> Si escuchas ruido, no pares <eos> Y aunque dijimos adiós, nunca digamos adiós <eos> Cuando me pides perdón, te pido perdón <eos> Tanta luz que apagó <eos> Y estoy seguro que dos no sobreviven con sólo un corazón <eos> Para abrazarnos, para mirarnos, para perdernos <eos> Mira, si la vida fuera fácil, yo tendría mil amores más <eos> Y tú seguro tendrías otro que te haga suspirar <eos> 
Come as you are, as you were <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a friend, as a friend <eos> As an old enemy <eos> Take your time, hurry up <eos> Choice is yours, don't be late <eos> Take a rest as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a trend, as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria (No, I don't have a gun) <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> 
Look out it's a space cadet <eos> Always arriving after the show has been set <eos> To check and make sure the scene is closed <eos> So he can prowl upon the bigger man it is known <eos> Torturing him to his car <eos> Torturing the rest to their comfort zones <eos> Howling the prey for another chance <eos> Another brash refrain <eos> Hey, I’m schooled and shot <eos> Space cadet hit me in the gut <eos> Impaling me on his fake intents <eos> Who knows what's next? <eos> Just a small taste <eos> Just a mild dose is all he ever craves <eos> The king of attention gone to waste <eos> Dropping a mention in conversations <eos> Critics will cringe back in hate <eos> As he retaliates with a certain kind of opinion <eos> Single minded point of view all made up just to use you <eos> Oh, so don’t show him up <eos> Don’t throw him off his golden throne <eos> For he’s the king of attention <eos> Don't distract him from his bow <eos> Oh its getting old but you can’t forget <eos> He’s the king of attention <eos> Making sure you're aware he’s a friend <eos> Hey, I’m schooled and shot <eos> Space cadet hit me in the gut <eos> And telling him it's in self defense <eos> Now I know what to expect <eos> He's a space cadet <eos> 
All the small things <eos> True care, truth brings <eos> I'll take one lift <eos> Your ride, best trip <eos> Always, I know <eos> You'll be at my show <eos> Watching, waiting <eos> Commiserating <eos> Say it ain't so, I will not go <eos> Turn the lights off, carry me home <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Late night, come home <eos> Work sucks, I know <eos> She left me roses by the stairs <eos> Surprises let me know she cares <eos> Just say it ain't so, I will not go <eos> Turn the lights off, carry me home <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na <eos> Say it ain't so, I will not go <eos> Turn the lights off, carry me home <eos> Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill <eos> The night will go on, my little windmill <eos> (Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na) <eos> Say it ain't so, I will not go <eos> (Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na) <eos> Turn the lights off, carry me home <eos> (Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na) <eos> Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill <eos> (Na na, na na, na na, na na, na, na) <eos> The night will go on, the night will go on, my little windmill <eos> 
I lost something <eos> I've been looking for it and everything <eos> 1, 2, 3 oh how it's inside of me <eos> Ooh ooh ooh endless silent nothing <eos> Even under someone somewhere <eos> Drinking their bed <eos> We have at least five useful holes in our heads <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> I take my dinner up(?) <eos> Down to skid row <eos> Everybody gets a piece <eos> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9, 10.5, 11 <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> And now let's make resolution <eos> Pursue this song <eos> I'm not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> I'm not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> Not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> I'm not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> Not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> Not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> Not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> Not gonna wait for the big bomb <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it when we work together <eos> God loves it <eos> Yes we do, yes we do, yes we do <eos> Hey love supreme <eos> I ever left and that's inside of me <eos> 4, 5, 6, oh my it's in everything <eos> How is it that I could never see <eos> How is it that I could never see <eos> 
The childhood part of my life <eos> It wasn't very pretty <eos> You see, I was born and raised <eos> In the slums of the city <eos> It was a one room shack that slept <eos> Ten other children beside me <eos> We hardly had enough food <eos> Or room to sleep <eos> It was hard times <eos> Needed something to ease <eos> My troubled mind <eos> Mmm, listen <eos> My father didn't know <eos> The meaning of work <eos> He disrespected Mama <eos> And treated us like dirt <eos> I left home seeking a job <eos> That I never did find <eos> Depressed and downhearted <eos> I took to Cloud Nine <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Listen, one more time <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Folks down there tell me <eos> They say, "Give yourself a chance, son <eos> Don't let life pass you by <eos> But the world of reality is a rat race <eos> Where only the strongest survive <eos> It's a dog-eat-dog world <eos> And that ain't no lie <eos> Listen, it ain't even safe no more <eos> To walk the streets at night" <eos> I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine <eos> Let me tell you about Cloud Nine <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And every man, every man is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And you're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> Cloud Nine <eos> I wanna say I love the life I live <eos> And I'm gonna live the life I love <eos> Up here on Cloud Nine <eos> I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high <eos> (On Cloud Nine) <eos> You're as free as a bird in flight <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> There's no difference between day and night <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> It's a world of love and harmony <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> Every man in his mind is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> 
Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos>

Morning scatters in and I am steady like a drug <eos> Feeling out this one <eos> She wakes up smashed as hell and steadies her ass against the rail <eos> And bends before the pounding rain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas all along about my love <eos> And I need this fucking fix and I beg her to pick from <eos> One of a million ways to feel no pain <eos> The morning after bends reflected in and I can hardly stand <eos> The way this whole thing makes me seem <eos> She climbs out from a dream with lungs hardening <eos> She screams a stereo scream <eos> And bends before astounding rain <eos> She's got a system made of metal with magnet bits inside her brain <eos> She opens her box of tricks and begs me to pick from <eos> One of a billion ways to feel no pain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me uptight, let me breathe now <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me upright, let me breathe now <eos>

Early in the year feeling, fade away <eos> Something has clearly gone today <eos> Don’t know what I can do <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That it’s the worst way to put you in a song <eos> And I knew it as the words came <eos> All of this was wrong <eos> Early in the year <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That you nearly heal <eos> In the feeling that fades away <eos> There’s something clearly gone today <eos> Don’t know what you wanna heal <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That it’s the worst way to put you in a song <eos> And I knew that as the words came <eos> All of this was wrong <eos> Early in the year <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> And don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Baby, don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Baby, don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Don’t I show it <eos> And even when the light’s on <eos> There’s something wrong and don’t I know it <eos> And you don’t have to tell me nothing <eos> Cause you know that you’ve already shown it <eos> And even when you’re good and strong <eos> The feeling’s gone and don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love is gone <eos> The night turns, she can try to show it <eos> Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I know it? <eos> Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I show it? <eos> Don’t I know it? <eos> Oh, why, why don’t I show it? <eos> Don’t I show it? <eos>

In 2028, I woke up late in Spain <eos> Gracias por esta vida <eos> Bought a little place, the view is really great <eos> Thank you for minding your business <eos> In 2029, I travelled back in time <eos> Stanley faked the moon landing <eos> I made some money, landed where it's sunny <eos> Thank you for minding your business <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> In 2032, the world and all we knew <eos> Exploded to millions of pieces <eos> New York City tanked <eos> And California sank deep down into the ocean <eos> In 2033, I woke up as a tree <eos> And found out what I had been missing <eos> I'm a willow tree, happy as can be <eos> Gracias por esta vida <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> I'm daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> I'm daydreaming, I'm daydreaming <eos> Daydreaming, daydreaming <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> All I can do is keep searching for knowledge <eos> And rising above it <eos> All I can do when my head's in the clouds <eos> Is be here in the moment <eos> 
(Verse 1 : ) <eos> I call you <eos> When I need you <eos> My heart's on fire <eos> You come to me <eos> Come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> Oh, you come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> You bring a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> You speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart baby <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Verse 2 : ) <eos> In your heart I see <eos> The start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Bridge : ) <eos> Each time you leave me <eos> I start losing control <eos> You're walking away <eos> With my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel it even when I'm alone <eos> Oh baby, don't let go <eos> (Chorus :) <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Outro :) <eos> You're the best <eos> 
Hanging on to a spinning wheel <eos> You're a broken soul and a broken girl <eos> Got that fire deep within those eyes <eos> From an atom bomb when you were only five <eos> Pretty girl, let your inside heal <eos> You abuse yourself and it's all you feel <eos> I don't mind, we're just playing here <eos> I'm alert this time like fucking Paul Revere <eos> Oh, you're such a fool, this modern love <eos> Oh, it's like the wind has killed the dove <eos> It's hard to live if you're hurtin' <eos> It's hard to live when you've always been let down <eos> A little kid and her villain <eos> She never ran 'cause she never really knew how <eos> So let the wolves come and rip that bad man down <eos> You're in a war but the end is in sight now <eos> The enemy is unguarded <eos> So let the motherfucker know his time's run out <eos> Burn the house in a dream I had <eos> With no clothes on and an evil laugh <eos> Threw the phone when you lost your shit <eos> With your high heels on and your red lipstick <eos> Pretty girl, are you home? That's right <eos> Get on your knees, we're going to play tonight <eos> You like to hunt with a deathly touch <eos> I can die here now by euphoria <eos> Oh, you're such a fool, this modern love <eos> Oh, it's like the wind has killed the dove <eos> Oh, please say it now, we've played enough <eos> Lost inside my mind, it's like a drug <eos> It's hard to live if you're hurtin' <eos> It's hard to live when you've always been let down <eos> A little kid and her villain <eos> She never ran 'cause she never really knew how <eos> So let the wolves come and rip that bad man down <eos> You're in a war but the end is in sight now <eos> The enemy is unguarded <eos> So let the motherfucker know his time's run out <eos> It's hard to live if you're hurtin' <eos> It's hard to live when you've always been let down <eos> A little kid and her villain <eos> She never ran 'cause she never really knew how <eos> So let the wolves come and rip that bad man down <eos> You're in a war but the end is in sight now <eos> The enemy is unguarded <eos> So let the motherfucker know his time's run out <eos> It's hard to live if you're hurtin' <eos> It's hard to live when you've always been let down <eos> A little kid and her villain <eos> She never ran 'cause she never really knew how <eos> So let the wolves come and rip that bad man down <eos> You're in a war but the end is in sight now <eos> The enemy is unguarded <eos> So let the motherfucker know his time's run out <eos> 
Tenemos que hablar <eos> No me cuadra que ya no te sienta igual , hace tiempo que no quieres ni cenar <eos> Y me aterra el que quieras terminar <eos> Por que e dicho te amo y no dices yo mas <eos> Te e dicho te extraño y no dices igual <eos> Se ve en tu cara que hay algo raro <eos> Te pido un beso y me abrasas no mas <eos> Con eso me llenas de inseguridad <eos> Es mas que claro que soy pasado <eos> Se nota de lejos que te quieres ir y me parte el alma el dejarte partir pero es correcto <eos> Si es tu deseo si en tu boca se le hiso el decir adios <eos> Primero anestiesame el corazon que va a dolerme el ya no verte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte <eos> No mientas mi amor tu no eras asi no me engañas por favor <eos> Fue que yo hise algo mal o alguien nuevo te gano y no empiezes con que todo esto lo invento yo <eos> Por que e dicho te amo y no dices yo mas <eos> Te e dicho te extraño y no dices igual <eos> Se ve en tu cara que hay algo raro <eos> Te pido un beso y me abrasas no mas <eos> Con eso me llenas de inseguridad <eos> Es mas que claro que soy pasado <eos> Se nota de lejos que te quieres ir y me parte el alma el dejarte partir pero es correcto <eos> Si es tu deseo si en tu boca se le hiso el decir adios <eos> Primero anestiesame el corazon que va a dolerme el ya no verte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte maldita mi suerte amarte y perderte <eos> 
The fertility leaves all your lands now <eos> You are defenseless <eos> Your shrines are trampled in blood <eos> And we are ruthless <eos> So you'll not see the flood <eos> Your wisest preachers <eos> They blindly look away... <eos> Repeating the same mistakes <eos> Trying in vain to be like Him <eos> But all your strength run out and fade <eos> Pray your dogs and release your slaves! <eos> But you deny our excellence - the refusal was sent <eos> You're hoping that we'll be afraid - you're wrong! <eos> "Immerse in the tons of stinking mud <eos> Obey to your new king! (New King) <eos> You'll be left with nothing in your hands <eos> Because of your stubbornness" <eos> Remember how the sun looked like <eos> Before it ebbed <eos> Peace has gone, you are doomed <eos> Cursed sands will be your last asylum <eos> Concourse of ugly creatures will profane your lands! You start to think <eos> That no one is coming, despite all the blessings - they'll never give you that life <eos> Fake Gods console you,being stuffed with the lie they pull the threads of fate <eos> But we will crush 'em and you'll got the reason to despise <eos> Remember how the sun looked like <eos> Before it ebbed <eos> Won't forgive, won't forget <eos> Broken chains can put an end to everything <eos> But the heart was hardened as a beast <eos> Too stupid to submit <eos> That everything will turn to dust <eos> "My people die in golden chains <eos> But I will designate the lanes <eos> You wanna rival with me now?" <eos> "Oh Lord, it's more to come! <eos> We will go - they will regret <eos> Heaven won't take their souls in <eos> Close your eyes - you will see <eos> Everybody knows - you're pests <eos> You're uninvited guests" <eos> "A new day will give us a new purpose and strength <eos> Believe us, we're gonna take our revenge <eos> 'cuz words are neeless and never leave our tongues <eos> And when you sleep - we're abide..." <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
She's comin for you <eos> Hear the chains rattle <eos> Turn you into a slave <eos> Another piece of chattel <eos> Across the seas <eos> Stormy waters <eos> Showed no mercy <eos> She was satan’s daughter <eos> Born to steal <eos> With bodies to sell <eos> She had her own special <eos> Place in hell <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> She took souls <eos> On a horrible trip <eos> Her morning song <eos> Was the crack of a whip <eos> Ones who survived <eos> Died a long time ago <eos> Most of them buried <eos> Out at old plateau <eos> But the pain and the memory <eos> Will never go away <eos> Her spirits still lives <eos> By the shores of the bay <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' with her ghost <eos> She was a dirty secret <eos> Forgot but not forgiven <eos> But the shame was so great <eos> She could not stay hidden <eos> She's on fire.... <eos> Her flame no longer lights up atnight <eos> Now dreams survive and hope burns bright <eos> People still come from miles around <eos> To praise the folks of africatown <eos> Who rose from the ashes of sad history <eos> To stand unchained proud and free <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> We’re still livin' with her ghost <eos> Clotilda’s on fire <eos> Off the alabama coast <eos> Clotilda's on fire <eos> We're still livin' <eos> We’re still livin' <eos> With her ghost <eos>

I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul <eos> Where I’ll end up, well, I think only God really knows <eos> I’ve sat upon the settin' sun <eos> But never, never, never, never <eos> I never wanted water once <eos> No, never, never, never <eos> I listen to my words, but they fall far below <eos> I let my music take me where my heart wants to go <eos> I've swam upon the devil’s lake <eos> But never, never, never, never <eos> I’ll never make the same mistake <eos> No, never, never, never <eos>

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen <eos> Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen <eos> But do you recall the most famous reindeer of all <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> Had a very shiny nose <eos> And if you ever saw it <eos> You would even say it glows <eos> All of the other reindeer <eos> Used to laugh and call him names <eos> They never let poor Rudolph <eos> Join in any reindeer games <eos> Then one foggy Christmas Eve <eos> Santa came to say <eos> Rudolph with your nose so bright <eos> Won't you guide my sleigh tonight <eos> Then how the reindeer loved him <eos> As they shouted out with glee <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> You'll go down in history <eos> (Repeat) <eos>

Me and Magdalena <eos> We're driving south through Monterey <eos> As the sun is slowly sinking <eos> Into a distant ocean wave <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Tell me Magdalena <eos> What do you see in the depths of your night? <eos> Do you see a long lost father? <eos> Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child? <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Me and Magdalena <eos> Always leaving early and sleeping late <eos> Secluded in the canyon <eos> Lost within a turn of fate <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> 
I really can't stay (Baby, it's cold outside) <eos> I've got to go away (But, I can call you a ride) <eos> This evening has been (I'm so glad that you dropped in) <eos> So very nice (Time spent with you is paradise) <eos> My momma will start to worry (I'll call the car and tell him to hurry) <eos> My daddy will be pacing the floor (Wait, what are you still livin' home for?) <eos> So, really, I'd better scurry (Your driver, his name is Murray) <eos> But maybe just a half a drink more (Oh, we're both adults, so who's keepin' score?) <eos> What will my friends think? (I think they should rejoice) <eos> If I have one more drink? (It's your body and your choice) <eos> Ooh, you really know how (Your eyes are like starlight now) <eos> To cast a spell (One look at you and then I fell) <eos> I ought to say, "No, no, no, sir" (Then you really ought to go, go, go) <eos> At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well, Murray, he just pulled up outside) <eos> Oh, I really can't stay <eos> (I understand, baby) <eos> Baby, it's cold outside <eos> I simply should go (Text me when you get home) <eos> Oh, I'm supposed to say no (Mm, I guess that's respectable) <eos> This welcome has been (I've been lucky that you dropped in) <eos> So nice and warm (But you better go before it storms) <eos> My sister will be suspicious (Well, gosh your lips look delicious) <eos> My brother will be there at the door (Oh, he loves my music, baby, I'm sure) <eos> My gossipy neighbor is vicious (I'm a genie, tell me what your wish is) <eos> But maybe just a cigarette more (Oh, that's somethin' we should probably explore) <eos> I've got to get home (Oh, baby, I'm well aware) <eos> Say, lend me a coat (Oh, keep it girl, I don't care) <eos> You've really been grand (I feel it when you touch my hands) <eos> But don't you see? (I want you to stay, it's not up to me) <eos> There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Well, they can talk, but what do they know?) <eos> At least there will be plenty implied (Oh, let them mind their business and go-) <eos> Uh, ma'am, I really can't stay <eos> Murray just go on <eos> It's cold, baby <eos> It's cold, baby <eos> But, ooh, I don't wanna go <eos> It's cold outside <eos>

Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Viendo el Guadalquivir <eos> Las gitanas lavan, los ninõs en la orilla <eos> Veindo los barcos pasar <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> En el Guadalquivir, mi gitana lavaba <eos> Pañuelo de blanco y oro <eos> Que yo te daba, que yo te daba <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> Tú me quieres dejar <eos> Yo no quiero sufrir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos> 
I like the shades you're wearing and I like your new tattoo <eos> I see you went and dyed your hair and got a new perfume <eos> I shouldda known you'd be here dancin' to a fiddle song <eos> Kickin' up dust and stirring up mem'ries, blurring lines between right and wrong <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a lightening strike sheds light on falling rain <eos> Some things never change <eos> I feel there's still a sliver of my old love-lorn soul <eos> Tangled inside your heart that I lost long ago <eos> Cause longin' don't seem to matter how many years go by <eos> You and me we fit together we don't even have to try <eos> But the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> Like a bonfire fades when it runs out of flame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Will the way you feel remain the same? <eos> They say true love finds a way <eos> No the chills and the thrills you've given me won't last long <eos> When the lights come up and the smoke clears you'll be gone <eos> And I'll be by myself as the sun shines on my shame <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> Some things never change <eos> 
Hoy me voy pensando en el mañana <eos> Tú te vas pensando si me amas <eos> El café espero pa que lo hagas <eos> Tu sabrás mi amor si me lo amargas <eos> Hoy pensé tal vez no te vería <eos> Me transporta, ultra onda transmitida <eos> Te encontré en la luna fugitiva <eos> Me escondí que corto son los días <eos> En Marte quiero amarte <eos> Y en Venus bajo el agua desnudarte <eos> En Urano ten mi mano <eos> Pa que veas que quererme es algo sano <eos> Y en Jupiter, te lo voa meter <eos> En Neptuno ese culito me lo voa comer <eos> Mercurio pa prender, Saturno pa crecer <eos> El cielo no se acaba y siempre yo te voa querer, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos> Hoy perrié flotando en la Galaxia <eos> Me bañe en tu Via Láctea <eos> Prendí un fili en tu Honda Civic <eos> Pa monchar en la Luna, hay un Chili's <eos> (Ana, baby, antes que te vayas quiero darte algo <eos> ¿Un collar? Que bello! Pérate un momento, T as in Troy? <eos> No, T as in Trans Rights! <eos> You shouldn’t have!) <eos> En Marte quiero amarte <eos> Y en Venus bajo el agua desnudarte <eos> En Urano ten mi mano <eos> Pa que veas que quererme es algo sano <eos> Y en Jupiter, te lo voa meter <eos> En Neptuno ese culito me lo voa comer <eos> Mercurio pa prender, Saturno pa crecer <eos> El cielo no se acaba y siempre yo te voa querer, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos> Con mi caco, baby <eos>

Well, I lost my heart on the day we met <eos> But I gained a lot and that I don't regret <eos> Then I hung around 'til you said I do <eos> I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name <eos> And neither one of us will ever be the same <eos> And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue <eos> 'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night <eos> And the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, I count my blessings every night I pray <eos> That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day <eos> And every day He does, 'cause God knows too <eos> That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on cold dark night <eos> Then the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you <eos> Well I've already said it but I swear it's true <eos> I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> 
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen <eos> Pour myself a cup of ambition <eos> Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life <eos> Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin' <eos> Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin' <eos> With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, for service and devotion <eos> You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion <eos> Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me <eos> I swear sometimes that man is out to get me <eos> Mmmmm... <eos> They let you dream just to watch them shatter <eos> You're just a step on the boss man's ladder <eos> But you got dreams he'll never take away <eos> In the same boat with a lot of your friends <eos> Waiting for the day your ship will come in <eos> And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way <eos> Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and you never get the credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos> 9 to 5, what a way to make a living <eos> Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving <eos> They just use your mind and they never give you credit <eos> It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it <eos> 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you <eos> There's a better life and you think about it don't you <eos> It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it <eos> And you spend your life putting money in his wallet <eos>

You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> When I met you <eos> I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around <eos> Turned you into someone new <eos> Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet <eos> Success has been so easy for you <eos> But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now <eos> And I can put you back down too <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> It's much too late to find <eos> You think you've changed your mind <eos> You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar <eos> That much is true <eos> But even then I knew I'd find a much better place <eos> Either with or without you <eos> The five years we have had have been such good times <eos> I still love you <eos> But now I think it's time I live my life on my own <eos> I guess it's just what I must do <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me <eos> Don't, don't you want me? <eos> You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me <eos> It's much too late to find <eos> You think you've changed your mind <eos> You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> Don't you want me, baby? <eos> Don't you want me, ohh? <eos> 
All along it was a fever <eos> A cold sweat, hot-headed believer <eos> I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something" <eos> He said, “If you dare, come a little closer” <eos> Round and around and around and around we go <eos> Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know <eos> Not really sure how to feel about it <eos> Something in the way you move <eos> Makes me feel like I can't live without you <eos> And it takes me all the way <eos> I want you to stay <eos> It's not much of a life you're living <eos> It's not just something you take, it's given <eos> Round and around and around and around we go <eos> Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know <eos> Not really sure how to feel about it <eos> Something in the way you move <eos> Makes me feel like I can't live without you <eos> And it takes me all the way <eos> And I want you to stay <eos> Ooh, the reason I hold on <eos> Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone <eos> Funny you're the broken one <eos> But I'm the only one who needed saving <eos> 'Cause when you never see the light <eos> It's hard to know which one of us is caving <eos> Not really sure how to feel about it <eos> Something in the way you move <eos> Makes me feel like I can't live without you <eos> And it takes me all the way <eos> I want you to stay <eos> Stay <eos> I want you to stay <eos> Ooh <eos> 
I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> When the lights go off, I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm <eos> The way you wrap those boys around your finger, go on and play the leader <eos> 'Cause you know it's what you're good at, the low road for the fast track <eos> Make every second last <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out <eos> 'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd <eos> Live and let live, you'll be the showgirl of the home-team <eos> I'll be the narrator, telling another tale of the American dream <eos> I see your name in lights, we can make you a star <eos> Girl, we'll take the world by storm, it isn't that hard <eos> 'Cause I got your picture, I'm coming with you, dear Maria, count me in <eos> There's a story at the bottom of this bottle, and I'm the pen <eos> Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out <eos> 'Cause it feels like stealing hearts calling your name from the crowd, woah-oh-oh <eos> Ha-ha <eos> Take a breath, don't it sound so easy?

I like being independent, not so much of an investment <eos> No one to tell me what to do <eos> I like being by myself, don’t gotta entertain anybody else <eos> No one to answer to <eos> But sometimes, I just want somebody to hold <eos> Someone to give me their jacket when it's cold <eos> Got that young love even when we’re old <eos> Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand <eos> Pick me up, pull me close, be my man <eos> I will love you till the end <eos> So if you’re out there I swear to be good to you <eos> But I’m done lookin’, for my future someone <eos> Cause when the time is right <eos> You’ll be here, but for now <eos> Dear no one, this is your love song <eos> I don’t really like big crowds <eos> I tend to shut people out <eos> I like my space, yeah <eos> But I’d love to have a soul mate <eos> God will give him to me someday <eos> And I know it’ll be worth the wait <eos> So if you’re out there I swear to be good to you <eos> But I’m done lookin’, for my future someone (oooh) <eos> Cause when the time is right <eos> You’ll be here, but for now <eos> Dear no one, this is your love song <eos> But sometimes, I just want somebody to hold <eos> Someone to give me their jacket when it's cold <eos> Got that young love even when we’re old <eos> Yeah sometimes, I want someone to grab my hand <eos> Pick me up, pull me close, be my man <eos> I will love you till the end <eos> So if you’re out there I swear to be good to you <eos> But I’m done lookin’, for my future someone <eos> Cause when the time is right <eos> You’ll be here, but for now <eos> Dear no one, this is your love song (dear no one) <eos> No need to be searching (dear no one) <eos> (Dear no one) <eos> Dear no one, this is your love song <eos> 
A heart that's full up like a landfill <eos> A job that slowly kills you <eos> Bruises that won't heal <eos> You look so tired, unhappy <eos> Bring down the government <eos> They don't, they don't speak for us <eos> I'll take a quiet life <eos> A handshake of carbon monoxide <eos> And no alarms and no surprises <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> Silent, silent <eos> This is my final fit <eos> My final bellyache with <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> No alarms and no surprises, please <eos> Such a pretty house <eos> And such a pretty garden <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> (Get me out of here) <eos> No alarms and no surprises <eos> (Get me out of here) <eos> No alarms and no surprises, please <eos> (Get me out of here) <eos> 
I'm a puppet on a string <eos> Tracy Island, time-traveling <eos> Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches <eos> Come to find you four in some velvet morning <eos> Years too late, she's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? <eos> Are you mine? Woah, ah <eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end <eos> Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes <eos> Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days <eos> Great escape, lost track of time and space <eos> She's a silver lining climbing on my desire <eos> And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?) <eos> And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways <eos> So in case, I'm mistaken, I <eos> Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby <eos> Are you mine?" <eos> She's a silver lining <eos> Lone ranger riding through an open space <eos> In my mind when she's not right there beside me <eos> I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be <eos> And satisfaction feels like a distant memory <eos> And I can't help myself, all I <eos> Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?" <eos> Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?) <eos> Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?) <eos> (Or just mine tonight?) <eos>
