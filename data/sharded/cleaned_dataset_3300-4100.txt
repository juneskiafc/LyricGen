See the curtains hangin' in the window <eos> In the evening on a Friday night <eos> A little light a-shinin' through the window <eos> Lets me know everything's all right <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' though the jasmine in my mind <eos> See the paper layin' on the sidewalk <eos> A little music from the house next door <eos> So I walk on up to the doorstep <eos> Through the screen and across the floor <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind <eos> Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom <eos> July is dressed up and playing her tune <eos> And I come home from a hard day's work <eos> And you're waiting there <eos> Not a care in the world <eos> See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen <eos> Through cookin' and the plates for two <eos> Feel the arms that reach out to hold me <eos> In the evening when the day is through <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind <eos> Summer breeze makes me feel fine <eos> Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind <eos> 
Si me niegas en tu vida <eos> Entraré de contrabando <eos> Cuesta el beso que se pide <eos> Vale más el que es robado <eos> Tengo tanta mercancía <eos> De un amor que no he estrenado <eos> Sé que otras lo querían <eos> Sólo a ti te lo regalo <eos> Despierta junto a mí desmaquillada <eos> Te luce mi camisa de pijama <eos> Es tuyo el otro lado de mi cama <eos> Por los días y las noches que me faltan <eos> Ay, que tú <eos> Tú eres más de lo que yo pedía <eos> Tanto te busqué, tanto te esperé <eos> Que llegué a pensar que no existías <eos> Ay, que tú <eos> Cambiaste el libro de mi biografía <eos> Fírmame la piel, yo soy tu papel <eos> Hagamos esta historia en coautoría <eos> Tu vida en la mía <eos> Si este amor es de una vía <eos> Yo manejo a contramano <eos> Muevo todas las señales <eos> Porque llegues a mis brazos <eos> Despierta junto a mí desmaquillada <eos> Te luce mi camisa de pijama <eos> Ya quédate a dormir en esta cama <eos> Por los días y las noches que nos faltan <eos> Ay, que tú <eos> Tú eres más de lo que yo pedía <eos> Tanto te busqué, ay, tanto te esperé <eos> Que llegué a pensar que no existías <eos> Ay, que tú <eos> Cambiaste el libro de mi biografía <eos> Fírmame la piel, yo soy tu papel <eos> Hagamos esta historia en coautoría <eos> Tu vida en la mía <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> Tú eres lo que tanto busqué y esperé <eos> Pensé que ya no existía <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> Perfecta de pies a cabeza <eos> Tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> Fírmame la piel <eos> Yo soy tu papel, bebé <eos> Papapapará, papapapará, papapapará, papapapará <eos> Papapapará, papapapará, papapapará, papapapará <eos> Papapapará, papapapará, papapapará, papapapará <eos> Papapapará, papapapará, papapapará, papapapará <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> ¡Ho-hova! <eos> ¡Ataca Sergio! <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> Jajaja <eos> Jaja, Chichí <eos> Jaja, ¡ay, Dios mío! <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> Tú, tú eres lo que yo quería <eos> Tú eres lo que yo pedía <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> Papapapará, papapapará (Papapapará, papapapará) <eos> ¡Tú! <eos> 
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me <eos> This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy <eos> I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know <eos> Somebody to have, somebody to hold <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to <eos> This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you <eos> Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear <eos> Somebody to have, just to know how it feels <eos> It's easy to say, but it's never the same <eos> I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape <eos> Now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes <eos> I fall into your arms <eos> I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around <eos> For now, the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> But now the day bleeds into nightfall <eos> And you're not here to get me through it all <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos> I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug <eos> I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved <eos>

Just yesterday morning, they let me know you were gone <eos> Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you <eos> I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song <eos> I just can't remember who to send it to <eos> I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Won't you look down upon me, Jesus <eos> You've got to help me make a stand <eos> You've just got to see me through another day <eos> My body's aching and my time is at hand <eos> And I won't make it any other way <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you again <eos> Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun <eos> Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around <eos> Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come <eos> Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground <eos> Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain <eos> I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end <eos> I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend <eos> But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now <eos> Thought I'd see you one more time again <eos> There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now <eos> Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now <eos> 
Woman <eos> Caught behind those burning eyes <eos> Tangled up in morning white <eos> Do you ever really know? <eos> Can you ever really know? <eos> Woman <eos> Watch her take me by surprise <eos> When she lets me call her mine <eos> Do you ever really know? <eos> Can you ever really know? <eos> And I don't know the loneliness you've known <eos> I don't hear the frosty words echo inside <eos> When you're gone again <eos> I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time, oh-oh-ohh <eos> There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes <eos> As the night ascends, all will slow again, oh-oh-ohh <eos> I am left in awe of the woman I adore <eos> Woman <eos> I never had such a sight <eos> Burn itself onto my mind <eos> Do you ever really know? <eos> Can you ever really know? <eos> But say the sun doesn't shine for you <eos> I hope you learn that that's not true, in time <eos> When you're gone again <eos> Just as long again <eos> I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time <eos> There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes <eos> As the night ascends, all will slow again <eos> But I am left in awe of the woman I adore <eos> I can't read your mind though I'm trying all the time <eos> There's something I don't know, I can see it in your eyes <eos> But as the night ascends, all will slow again <eos> And I am left in awe of the woman I adore <eos> 
There's another world inside of me that you may never see <eos> There's secrets in this life that I can't hide <eos> But somewhere in this darkness <eos> There's a light that I can't find <eos> Well maybe it's too far away, yeah <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When your education x-ray <eos> Cannot see under my skin <eos> I won't tell you a damn thing <eos> That I could not tell my friends <eos> Roaming through this darkness <eos> I'm alive, but I'm alone <eos> And part of me is fighting this <eos> But part of me is gone <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Or maybe I'm just blind <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> Hold me when I'm scared <eos> And love me when I'm gone <eos> Everything I am and everything in me <eos> Wants to be the one you wanted me to be <eos> I'd never let you down <eos> Even if I could <eos> I'd give up everything <eos> If only for your good <eos> So hold me when I'm here <eos> Right me when I'm wrong <eos> You can hold me when I'm scared <eos> You won't always be there <eos> So love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> Love me when I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> When I'm gone <eos> 
I get lost in your eyes <eos> And I feel my spirits rise <eos> And soar like the wind <eos> Is it love that I am in? <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> And now I know <eos> 'Cause when I'm lost <eos> I can let go <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I just fell <eos> Don't know why <eos> Something's there we can't deny <eos> And when I first knew <eos> Was when I first looked at you <eos> And if I can't find my way <eos> If salvation is worlds away <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> It's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I don't mind not knowing <eos> What I'm heading for <eos> You can take me to the skies <eos> Oh it's like being lost in heaven <eos> When I'm lost in your eyes <eos> I get weak in a glance <eos> Isn't this what's called romance? <eos> Oh, I'll be found <eos> When I am lost in your eyes <eos>

Weightlessness, no gravity <eos> Were we somewhere in-between? <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Oh, highway boys all sleeping in <eos> With their dirty mouths and broken strings <eos> Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea <eos> For you, the queen of San Luis <eos> I’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> Cutting through the avenues <eos> I'd always find my way to you <eos> Beside the hook, the hammer lies <eos> Fumbling round in the smoke <eos> Spending time chasing ghosts <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> Hold me down, hold me down, child <eos> California called you queen <eos> With your golden hair and magazine <eos> Were you somewhere in-between? <eos> Fast asleep, a flying dream <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> I'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me <eos> A bird’s-eye view of San Luis <eos> 
In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone; <eos> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow <eos> In the bleak midwinter, long ago <eos> Our god, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain; <eos> Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign <eos> In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed <eos> The lord God almighty, jesus christ <eos> Angels and archangels may have gathered there <eos> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air; <eos> But his mother only, in her maiden bliss <eos> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss <eos> What can I give him, poor as I am? <eos> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb; <eos> If I were a wise man, I would do my part; <eos> Yet what I can I give him: give my heart <eos>

It was Christmas Eve, babe <eos> In the drunk tank <eos> An old man said to me <eos> "Won't see another one" <eos> And then he sang a song <eos> 'The Rare Old Mountain Dew' <eos> I turned my face away <eos> And dreamed about you <eos> Got on a lucky one <eos> Came in eighteen-to-one <eos> I've got a feeling <eos> This year's for me and you <eos> So, Happy Christmas <eos> I love you, baby <eos> I can see a better time <eos> When all our dreams come true <eos> They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold <eos> But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old <eos> When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve <eos> You promised me Broadway was waiting for me <eos> You were handsome! <eos> You were pretty, Queen of New York City <eos> When the band finished playing <eos> They howled out for more <eos> Sinatra was swinging <eos> All the drunks, they were singing <eos> We kissed on a corner <eos> Then danced through the night <eos> The boys of the NYPD choir <eos> Were singing, "Galway Bay" <eos> And the bells were ringing out <eos> For Christmas Day <eos> You're a bum, you're a punk <eos> You're an old slut on junk <eos> Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed <eos> You scumbag, you maggot <eos> You cheap, lousy faggot <eos> Happy Christmas, your arse <eos> I pray God it's our last <eos> The boys of the NYPD choir <eos> Still singing, "Galway Bay" <eos> And the bells are ringing out <eos> For Christmas Day <eos> "I could have been someone" <eos> Well, so could anyone <eos> You took my dreams from me <eos> When I first found you <eos> I kept them with me, babe <eos> I put them with my own <eos> Can't make it all alone <eos> I've built my dreams around you <eos> The boys of the NYPD choir <eos> Still singing, "Galway Bay" <eos> And the bells are ringing out <eos> For Christmas Day <eos>

Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que nada de ayer hoy te hace llorar <eos> Tú con él <eos> El tiempo corre, yo te espero, pero tú con él <eos> Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Estás tranquila, lo mereces, siempre fuiste bien <eos> Tú con él <eos> No me sorprende, sospechaba terminar así <eos> Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Que tú podías, si querías vivir sin su amor <eos> Perdóname <eos> No me di cuenta de ese juego y me enamoré <eos> Después fue tarde, no podía ya volver atrás <eos> Y te quería cada día más y más <eos> Seguro, mujer, que hoy eres feliz <eos> Que puedes hacer lo que quieras tú <eos> Tú con él <eos> Ya me han contado que estás linda, mucho más que ayer <eos> Que no me odias y preguntas siempre algo de mí <eos> Al fin y al cabo un poquito yo me hice querer <eos> Disculpame <eos> Aquellos celos tan intensos que senti por ti <eos> Estaba loco, casi loco, por aquel amor <eos> Y al poco tiempo para siempre lo perdí <eos> Tú con él Aún recuerdo el romance que viviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Yo sé que jugaste con mis sentimientos <eos> Tú con él Todo fue un juego que tuviste conmigo <eos> Tú con él Pero en ese juego yo me enamoré <eos> Tú con él Yo no me di cuenta, escucha mujer <eos> Tú con él Pero te lo juro, mamita, desperté <eos> Tú con él Ya no recuerdas mis locuras ni el amor aquel <eos> Tú con él Yo solamente fui la excusa para hacerle ver <eos> Tú con él Que tú podías, si te querías vivir sin él <eos> Tú con él En el juego del amor, unos vienen y otros van <eos>

De los Corredones originales <eos> Con mis compas de Grupo Firme <eos> Dice, más o menos, así <eos> Yo no soy lúcido, mucho menos presumido <eos> Pero sí me doy a respetar <eos> A los envidiosos vieran cómo los detesto <eos> Porque nomás hablan por hablar <eos> Pacas de billetes, produciendo diariamente <eos> Pues, mi meta ha sido duplicar <eos> Odio las mentiras, pero adoro a mi familia <eos> Y por ellos yo voy a luchar <eos> Y la Cruz de Elota llevo en mi pecho <eos> Ranchito que no he de olvidar <eos> Revivir mi infancia, pero ya tengo ganancias <eos> Y, gracias a Dios, ya andamos bien vestidos <eos> Zapatito' fino' los que me ven aportar <eos> Ahorita andamos bateando, poco a poco progresando <eos> Y nadie me va a tumbar <eos> Y pura Marca MP con Bachato <eos> Así suena Grupo Firme, compa' Edwin (Uh) <eos> Y la Banda Nuevo Estilo, mi viejo <eos> Y puro music VIP, viejo <eos> Puro art and music, viejo <eos> No soy traficante, pero festejo a lo grande <eos> Y con amigos jalo un buen bandón <eos> Tengo mil veinte años y el que ocupe de mi mano <eos> Tendrá cien por ciento mi apoyo <eos> Ni rico ni pobre, pero tengo lo que quiero <eos> Y mis gustos siempre me los doy <eos> Mucho le agradezco al viejón por sus consejos <eos> Y por todo lo que me inculcó <eos> Y mientras hay que disfrutar la vida <eos> Porque cualquier día se nos va <eos> Muchas cosas me han pasado <eos> Pero nunca me he quebrado <eos> Y todo gracias al Señor de arriba <eos> Que me cuida y me protege todo el tiempo del mal <eos> Por el valle ruleteando, en mi carro ando zumbando <eos> El güero, se oye mentar <eos> Ahí nomás, pa' las Cocas (Uh) <eos>

Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Life just got in the way, don't know what to say <eos> She's heard it all before, lying on her bedroom floor <eos> Thinking my life has to be worth more <eos> She dreams of going to New York City <eos> Her heart's already there but her head's fighting a war <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking for a star but it's just too dark <eos> When streams get a little bit wider <eos> And it's hard to swim across the water <eos> And the scars get a little bit deeper <eos> And a flame turns into a fire <eos> Tonight whеn you need a way home <eos> Someone to lеan on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> Old man trying to make it on his own <eos> Looking at the space where his wife once was <eos> Wants to find just something to believe in <eos> He hears a knock at the door this evening <eos> She says I'm going to New York City to follow my dreams <eos> Would you come with me? <eos> Little girl, only seventeen years old <eos> Looking at the stars in her granddad's eyes <eos> And the streams get a little bit wider <eos> But together they cross the river <eos> And the scars get a little bit lighter <eos> And the sky looks a little brighter <eos> Tonight when you need a way home <eos> Someone to lean on, some kind of hero <eos> It's there when you look in the mirror <eos> Staring back at you, there's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> You <eos> You <eos> There's a hero in you <eos> 
When I met you in the summer <eos> To my heartbeat's sound <eos> We fell in love <eos> As the leaves turned brown <eos> And we could be together, baby <eos> As long as skies are blue <eos> You act so innocent now <eos> But you lied so soon <eos> When I met you in the summer <eos> When I met you in the summer (Summer) <eos> To my heartbeat's sound (Yeah, yeah) <eos> We fell in love (Love) <eos> As the leaves turned brown (Yeah, yeah) <eos> And we could be together, baby <eos> As long as skies are blue (Yeah, yeah) <eos> You act so innocent now <eos> But you lied so soon (Yeah, yeah) <eos> When I met you in the summer <eos> Summer <eos> When I met you in the summer (Summer) <eos> (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Love) <eos> (Yeah, yeah) <eos> Summer (Summer) <eos> (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Love) <eos> (Yeah, yeah) <eos> 
Deutsch <eos> TEXT: Ernst Anschütz, 1824 <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> Du grünst nicht nur <eos> Zur Sommerzeit <eos> Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit <eos> Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Dein Kleid will mich <eos> Was lehren: <eos> Die Hoffnung und Beständigkeit <eos> Gibt Trost und Kraft <eos> Zu jeder Zeit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Das soll dein Kleid <eos> Mich lehren <eos> English <eos> Literal English translation <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> You're green not only <eos> In the summertime <eos> No, also in winter when it snows <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> How often has not at Christmastime <eos> A tree like you given me such joy! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> Your dress wants to <eos> Teach me something: <eos> Your hope and durability <eos> Provide comfort and strength <eos> At any time <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> That's what your dress should <eos> Teach me <eos> 
Çocuktum masum hayallerim vardı <eos> Mesela her çocuk gibi futbolcu olmak <eos> Mahalle aralarında top yuvarlardık <eos> Cam kırardık, çok can sıkardık <eos> Çocuktum masum oyunlar oynardık <eos> Mesela külah atardık Ermeni'ye <eos> Boncuklu tabancalarımız vardı, mermi değil <eos> Doğal olarak eşit görüyorduk her bireyi <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk. Ne bilelim ayrım gayrım <eos> Bir çocuğun bilmediği tek şey ayrılmaydı <eos> Çünkü çocuktuk be amına koyayım, en azından <eos> Masum olmak gerektiğinin farkındaydık <eos> Nasıl bir çocukmuşuz yetişkinden öte <eos> Bizim tek derdimiz saklambaç oynarken bir sote! <eos> Velhasıl kelam <eos> Çocukken sual şimdi insan olmak ödev <eos> Çocuktum sen bilir misin bir futbolcu kartının <eos> Küçük bir çocuk için ne ifade ettiğini? <eos> Sek sek mermerinin bozuk bir asfaltta, saniyede kaç ivmeyle kaç defa sektiğini? <eos> Bilir misin karanlık bir köşe başında, ilk dumanı ciğerlerime 10 yaşımda çektiğimi? <eos> Nerden bile bilirdim mahalledeki abilerin ruh ve beden sağlığına nifak tohumu ektiğini! <eos> Ey gidi Trabzon! <eos> Boztepe'nin manzarasını inan hayal edemezdi Picasso <eos> 14 yaşındaydım, küçük bir arka mahalleden koca bir metropole geçiş yapmak biraz zordu <eos> Be İstanbul şiir gibisin de okumak ne mümkün! <eos> Ne hengamesi, ne malı, ne mülkü! <eos> Bu şehir milyonlarca insan içinde, yalnızlığın bestelendiği, enstrümanı kalabalığın sesi olan bir türkü! <eos> 
Remember those walls I built? <eos> Well, baby, they're tumblin' down <eos> And they didn't even put up a fight <eos> They didn't even make a sound <eos> I found a way to let you in <eos> But I never really had a doubt <eos> Standin' in the light of your halo <eos> I got my angel now <eos> It's like I've been awakened <eos> Every rule I had you breakin' <eos> It's the risk that I'm takin' <eos> I ain't never gonna shut you out <eos> Everywhere I'm lookin' now <eos> I'm surrounded by your embrace <eos> Baby, I can see your halo <eos> You know you're my savin' grace <eos> You're everything I need and more <eos> It's written all over your face <eos> Baby, I can feel your halo <eos> Pray it won't fade away <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo <eos> Halo <eos> Hit me like a ray of sun <eos> Burnin' through my darkest night <eos> You're the only one that I want <eos> Think I'm addicted to your light <eos> I swore I'd never fall again <eos> But this don't even feel like fallin' <eos> Gravity can't begin <eos> To pull me back to the ground again <eos> It's like I've been awakened <eos> Every rule I had you breakin' <eos> The risk that I'm takin' <eos> I'm never gonna shut you out <eos> Everywhere I'm lookin' now <eos> I'm surrounded by your embrace <eos> Baby, I can see your halo <eos> You know you're my savin' grace <eos> You're everything I need and more <eos> It's written all over your face <eos> Baby, I can feel your halo <eos> Pray it won't fade away <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo <eos> Halo <eos> Halo <eos> Ooh <eos> Everywhere I'm lookin' now <eos> I'm surrounded by your embrace <eos> Baby, I can see your halo <eos> You know you're my savin' grace <eos> You're everything I need and more <eos> It's written all over your face <eos> Baby, I can feel your halo <eos> Pray it won't fade away <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo <eos> Halo, oh oh <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can feel your halo, halo, halo <eos> I can see your halo, halo <eos> Halo <eos> 
Guess what I did today <eos> Those were the words I said to you <eos> It was last may, dont know the exact day <eos> In my hand there was a ring <eos> Then you told me that you loved me <eos> More than anything in your life <eos> So I asked you would you do me <eos> The honor of being my wife <eos> Yes I will <eos> I will be your man <eos> Your protector, your best friend <eos> Till my humble life is ended <eos> And time begins again, couldn't we be... <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after? <eos> We could be strong together for so long <eos> My love is oh so strong <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after? <eos> Couldn't we be? <eos> Leaving you never till forever's gone <eos> When I was away, mmm, mmm <eos> Some friends became just faces <eos> Some people grew apart <eos> But you stayed right in my heart <eos> And so many times <eos> Pictured this day inside my mind <eos> And for so many years, ooh <eos> I knew it would be you here with me, oh <eos> Yes I will <eos> Take you for my wife <eos> The center of my life <eos> And I will never, ever fade <eos> From this choice I made, oh <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after? <eos> C'mon <eos> We could be strong together for so long <eos> Said my love is strong <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after? <eos> Couldn't we be, babe? <eos> Leaving you never till forever's gone <eos> No no, Hey yeah <eos> You don't have to look no further than me <eos> Don't look no more, baby yeah <eos> You don't need much more than my lovin' to make you happy <eos> I'm so happy, I'm so happy babe <eos> Beneath the sight of God, I will make this vow to you, come on baby <eos> I'll be right here, stay with me <eos> Said I'll be here, baby hey <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after <eos> I said I wanna be, I said I wanna be <eos> We could be strong together for so long <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after <eos> Couldn't we be, babe? <eos> Leaving you never till forever's gone <eos> No, no I will never leave you, ooh <eos> Couldn't we be happily ever after... <eos> See today, I wanna make you my wife... <eos> 
He intentado casi todo para convencerte, uh <eos> Mientras el mundo se derrumba todo, aquí a mis pies, yeah <eos> Mientras aprendo de esta soledad que desconozco, woah <eos> Me vuelvo a preguntar quizás si sobreviviré <eos> Porque sin ti me queda la conciencia helada y vacía <eos> Porque sin ti me he dado cuenta amor que no renaceré, yeah <eos> Porque he ido más allá del límite de la desolación <eos> Mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Ay, yo te juro que <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida (No) <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Qué no dejaría <eos> Y duelen más la' cosa' buena' cuando estás ausente <eos> Yo sé que e' demasiado tarde para remediar <eos> No me queda bien valerme de diez mil excusas <eos> Cuando definitivamente sé que ahora te vas <eos> Y aunque no lo pueda cambiar, yo seguiré esperándote <eos> Por si algún día tú me quiere' ver bien <eos> Aunque te vuelva a repetir que estoy muriendo día a día <eos> Aunque también estés muriendo, tú no me perdonarás <eos> Aunque sin ti haya llegado al límite de la desolación <eos> Y mi cuerpo, mi mente y mi alma, ya no tienen conexión <eos> Yo sigo muriéndome <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe <eos> Lo dejaría todo porque te quedaras <eos> Mi credo, mi pasado, mi religión (Mi religión) <eos> Después de todo, estás rompiendo nuestros lazos (Yeah) <eos> Y dejas en pedazos este corazón <eos> Mi piel también la dejaría <eos> Mi nombre, mi fuerza <eos> Hasta mi propia vida <eos> Y qué más da perder <eos> Si te llevas del todo mi fe, oh <eos> CNCO <eos> 
Oye como va mi ritmo <eos> Bueno pa' gozar, mulata <eos> Oye como va mi ritmo <eos> Bueno pa' gozar mulata <eos> Oye como va mi ritmo <eos> Bueno pa' gozar, mulata <eos> Oye como va mi ritmo <eos> Bueno pa' gozar mulata <eos> 
Well, I lost my heart on the day we met <eos> But I gained a lot and that I don't regret <eos> Then I hung around 'til you said I do <eos> I knew I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, it changed my thinkin' when you changed your name <eos> And neither one of us will ever be the same <eos> And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue <eos> 'Cause I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on a cold dark night <eos> And the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No, I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> Well, I count my blessings every night I pray <eos> That the Lord lets me keep you just one more day <eos> And every day He does, 'cause God knows too <eos> That I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> If I didn't have you I'd long ago <eos> Been left in the dark out in the cold <eos> Blowin' around from town to town <eos> Like a feather in the wind <eos> If I didn't have you I know I'd be <eos> Flounderin' around like a ship at sea <eos> Lost in the rain of a hurricane <eos> And that's where I'd have been <eos> But I didn't get lost 'cause I saw your light <eos> Shinin' like a beacon on cold dark night <eos> Then the sun came up and the skies turned blue <eos> No I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you <eos> Well I've already said it but I swear it's true <eos> I know I wouldn't have nothin' if I didn't have you <eos> 
Era uma vez <eos> Um rasgo de magia <eos> Dança de sombra e de luz <eos> De sonho e fantasia <eos> Num ritual que me seduz <eos> Cinema que me dás tanta alegria <eos> Deixa a música <eos> Crescer nesta cadência <eos> Na tela do meu caração <eos> Voltar a ser criança <eos> E assim esquecer a solidão <eos> Os alhos a brilhar <eos> Numa sala escura <eos> Voa a 24 imagens por segundo <eos> Meu comovida caração <eos> Aprendeu a voar <eos> Neste Cinema Paraíso <eos> Que eu trago no olhar <eos> E também no sorriso <eos> 
Yo no entiendo de colores ni de razas <eos> A mí me gusta el morenito de tu cara <eos> Te he buscado en cada tarde, vida mía <eos> Se me corta la respiración por ti <eos> Lo siento, bebé <eos> Tu pasito en mi camino va naciendo <eos> Sólo porque tú me miras yo me muero <eos> Los atardeceres de tus ojos, mira <eos> La verdad que tiene niña, tus enojos <eos> Yo sé que tú a mí me quieres un poco <eos> Con tu carita posada en mi hombro <eos> Mira quien canta es la voz de mi alma <eos> Mi persona favorita <eos> Tiene la cara bonita <eos> Tiene un ángel su sonrisa <eos> Tiene un corazón y yo <eos> A mi persona favorita <eos> Yo le canto esta cosita <eos> De juguete ten mi vida <eos> Juega con mi corazón <eos> Ohhhh <eos> Eres como el sol <eos> Sales sin razón <eos> Dando luz y calma <eos> Una sola flor <eos> Que me guardo yo <eos> Y tú voz que me desarma <eos> Yo sé que tú a mí me quieres un poco <eos> Con tu carita posada en mi hombro <eos> Mira quien canta es la voz de mi alma <eos> (Lerelerele) <eos> Mi persona favorita <eos> Tiene la cara bonita <eos> Tiene un ángel su sonrisa <eos> Tiene un corazón y yo <eos> A mi persona favorita <eos> Yo le canto esta cosita <eos> De juguete ten mi vida <eos> Juega con mi corazón <eos> Yo sé que tú a mí me quieres un poco <eos> Con tu carita pegada en mi hombro <eos> Mi persona favorita <eos> Tiene la cara bonita <eos> Tiene un ángel su sonrisa <eos> Tiene un corazón y yo <eos> A mi persona favorita <eos> Yo le canto esta cosita <eos> De juguetes ten mi vida <eos> Juega con mi corazón <eos> Mi persona favorita <eos> Tiene la cara bonita <eos> Tiene un ángel su sonrisa <eos> Tiene un corazón y yo <eos> A mi persona favorita <eos> Yo le canto esta cosita <eos> De juguete ten mi vida <eos> Juega con mi corazón <eos> Mi persona favorita (Mi persona favorita) <eos> Tiene la cara bonita (Tiene la cara bonita) <eos> Tiene un ángel su sonrisa <eos> Tiene un corazón y yo <eos> Mi persona favorita <eos> Yo le canto esta cosita <eos> De juguete ten mi vida <eos> Juega con mi corazón <eos> 
¿De qué está hecho tu corazón? <eos> Dime que no está vacío <eos> Que yo tengo el mío lleno de ilusiones contigo <eos> Tick tock, we took it too far <eos> Don't wanna say goodbye <eos> Stop killing our fire (our fire) <eos> Time is running out <eos> How could you do this to us, we were flying? <eos> Si no puedo borrar las estrellas <eos> No me pidas que olvide tu huella <eos> I die every night and everyday <eos> Crying my way to the moon <eos> How come there is no other way? <eos> I don't wanna live without you <eos> Te busco en cada amanecer <eos> Y en el último rayo de luz <eos> Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez <eos> Me invento un nuevo tabú <eos> What can I do to take us back <eos> Back to the very beginning <eos> When only your eyes could see mine <eos> Remember that? <eos> Tic tac, suena el reloj <eos> Llega el adiós <eos> Socorro, no tengo bengalas <eos> Si no queda amor <eos> Dime qué siento entre el pecho y las alas <eos> No, I don't wanna leave it behind us <eos> 'Cause my love, I can't do this without you <eos> Te busco en cada amanecer <eos> Y en el último rayo de luz <eos> Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez <eos> Me invento un nuevo tabú <eos> I die every night and every day (every day) <eos> Staring you down from the moon <eos> Just tell me that you're on the way <eos> Only you can break the taboo <eos> Te busco en cada amanecer <eos> Y en el último rayo de luz <eos> Desarmo mi cuerpo otra vez <eos> Me invento un nuevo tabú <eos> I die every night and every day <eos> Staring you down from the moon <eos> Just tell me that you're on the way <eos> Only you can break the taboo <eos> Ooh <eos> Oh, baby <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Ooh <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Only you can break the taboo <eos>

I know everything changes <eos> Yeah, it's strange how time marches on <eos> Maybe there'll be some time in the future <eos> Oh, tell me I'm not wrong <eos> Oh, if I could stop time <eos> It would be a frozen moment just around Christmas <eos> When all of mankind reveals its truest potential <eos> And there is sympathy for the suffering <eos> Yes, there is sympathy for those who are suffering <eos> And the world embraces peace and love and mercy <eos> Instead of power and fear <eos> And as sure as I'm standing here <eos> I swear it really does appear that a change comes over us <eos> Yes, some kind of change comes over us <eos> And it's glimpsed for one shining moment <eos> And this change feels like a change that's real <eos> But then it passes along with the season <eos> And then we just go back to the way we were <eos> Yes, we just go back to the way we were <eos> Say it isn't so <eos> Tell me I'm not just a dreamer <eos> I'm talking with a friend and he knows how it ends <eos> He says it's easier, that's just the way we are <eos> That's human nature and that's just the way we are <eos> Oh, say it isn't so! <eos> 
Now, out of the night <eos> Soft as the dawn <eos> Into the light <eos> This Child <eos> Innocent Child <eos> Soft as a fawn <eos> This Child is born <eos> One small heart <eos> One pair of eyes <eos> One work of art <eos> Here in my arms <eos> Here he lies <eos> Trusting and warm <eos> Blessed this morn <eos> A Child is born <eos> One small heart <eos> One pair of eyes <eos> One work of art <eos> Here in my arms <eos> Here he lies <eos> Trusting and warm <eos> Blessed this morn <eos> A Child is born <eos> 
Lost and weary traveler <eos> Searching for the way to go <eos> Stranger, heavy-hearted <eos> Longing for someone to known <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light to guide you home <eos> There are weary travelers <eos> Searching everywhere you go <eos> Strangers who are searching <eos> Longing deeply to be known <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light to guide you home <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light <eos> May you find a light to guide you home <eos>

You really think that you're bigger than this <eos> To the tune of ten thousand lisps <eos> Who'd have thought we'd represent <eos> When I can't take a compliment? <eos> Overexposure is the key <eos> And any focus on me <eos> Is appreciated <eos> And it should be <eos> No wonder now <eos> I finally found <eos> The right formula for... <eos> You taught me how <eos> I play the fool <eos> Every mistake that I make <eos> I couldn't have made without you <eos> What's said is done <eos> And plain to see <eos> You take it all too seriously <eos> What better way to make an honest mistake <eos> Than a televised hand of fate? <eos> When the world closes in on you <eos> A decision would be overdue <eos> Now, nothing left is out of hand <eos> A stronger, jaded man stands <eos> If the world is ending <eos> Then we toast to it <eos> I'm stronger now <eos> But not without <eos> The right formula for... <eos> You taught me how <eos> I play the fool <eos> Every mistake that I make <eos> I couldn't have made without you <eos> What's said is done <eos> And plain to see <eos> Here's all you get from me <eos> Here's all you get from me <eos> I'm down for whatever <eos> What's there left to wait for? <eos> I'm down for whatever <eos> What's there left to wait for? <eos> Wait for? <eos> I wait! <eos> You taught me how <eos> I play the fool <eos> Every mistake that I make <eos> I couldn't have made without you <eos> What's said is done <eos> And plain to see <eos> Here's all you get from me <eos> 
Lights are down, but you're shining like you always do <eos> Every day, I'm reminded of the miracle of you <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed <eos> Watching you spin in that dress <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> I keep checking you for halos <eos> Swear you're an angel in disguise <eos> You poke my mind from every angle, and I <eos> I can see Heaven in your eyes <eos> You're too good for coincidence <eos> And too perfect for an accident <eos> And I'm not sure where Heaven is <eos> But every night, I get a glimpse <eos> And I know I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm <eos> Baby, you're the kind of girl that I've always prayed for <eos> And I swear by my dying breath that I will be faithful <eos> Oh, baby <eos> 'Cause I'm on my knees (I'm on my knees) <eos> Whoa, you make me believe <eos> Baby, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> Watching you spin in that dress (Dress) <eos> Making my heart beat out my chest <eos> I can't count the times I've heard <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed (Blessed) <eos> And all I ain't got is my breath (Breath) <eos> You stole it the first time we met <eos> You're more than I deserve <eos> People say I'm lucky, but lucky ain't the word <eos> Oh, I'm blessed <eos> 
Mercy <eos> Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me? <eos> Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning? <eos> Mercy <eos> Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working? <eos> Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning? <eos> Cause it's still burning <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely <eos> Wind up home alone please don't call me <eos> And say you miss me, no <eos> So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Woah <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> If you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> If you're gonna take your shot, take it <eos> Take it <eos> Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it <eos> And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it <eos> Take it <eos> If you made up your mind, then make it <eos> But make this fast <eos> If you ever loved me <eos> Mmmh if you ever loved me <eos> Have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Oh have mercy <eos> Have mercy <eos> 
Maybe in ten years <eos> You'll call me on your telephone <eos> Wondering if I'm all alone <eos> Remember how we knew each other? <eos> In ten years, everyone's been down the line <eos> And we've all ended up fine <eos> I no longer know your number <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> We used to talk real slow <eos> About the things that no one knows <eos> I hate when people bring flowers <eos> Trapped in glass their final hour <eos> And life rolls, it's all so fast until it slows <eos> We cried that night in Carrboro <eos> Realized we were letting go <eos> I used to love you like the world would end <eos> I used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> Used to love you like the world would end <eos> Used to love you like a child <eos> The thing about people is they change <eos> When they walk away <eos> 
Alone <eos> You and I intertwine <eos> Refreshing conversation for the mind <eos> As we stare <eos> We both seek and hope to find <eos> Real love purified <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> Baby, just relax and ride <eos> If you got time then I got time <eos> (Yeah, yeah) <eos> Free your thoughts and watch them fly <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> (Baby) <eos> I sigh as I watch you sleeping there (Sleeping there) <eos> So easily I did things I'd never dare (Never dare) <eos> I say to myself, "I'm glad that we share <eos> Real love purified", oh <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> (Use your heart and not your eyes, baby) <eos> Baby, just relax and ride <eos> If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (If you got time then I got time) <eos> Free your thoughts and watch them fly <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Use your heart <eos> My goodness, how it seems like yesterday (Yesterday) <eos> She crossed you hurt you in the strongest way (Strongest way) <eos> You've hurt so long, reward come to those who cry <eos> Real love purified <eos> Just a second <eos> I look at my watch's dial <eos> And you love me, pampered me like a child <eos> As we lay, I close my eyes and I smile <eos> At your real love purified <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> (Oh, baby) <eos> Baby, just relax and ride <eos> If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (If you got the time, then I got the time) <eos> Free your thoughts and watch them fly <eos> (Baby, won't you use your heart) <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes (Use your heart, baby) <eos> Baby, just relax and ride <eos> If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (So that they can see what is destiny for you) <eos> Free your thoughts and watch them fly (Ooh baby) <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes (Use your heart) <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> (Relax and ride, relax and ride) <eos> Baby, just relax and ride (Relax and ride) <eos> If you got time then I got time (Yeah, yeah) <eos> (Oh yeah, use your heart) <eos> Free your thoughts and watch them fly <eos> (Watch them fly) <eos> Use your heart and not your eyes <eos> 
Can we call it kinda? Yeah <eos> When we met <eos> That seems really good <eos> When we met, I wasn't me <eos> I was so numb, yeah, I was so lonely <eos> Out on the run, I wasn't free <eos> And you came along, but you couldn't save me <eos> My hesitation and holdin' my breath <eos> I led you into the garden of my loneliness <eos> Wished that you left before it all burned down <eos> Oh, Julia <eos> I'm sorry what I do to ya <eos> I push and pull and mess with your head <eos> Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down <eos> Oh, Julia <eos> I wish I never lied to ya <eos> I never meant to hurt you like that <eos> And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone <eos> When I left, I wasn't sure <eos> That I could love, love anymore <eos> But my hesitation and holdin' my breath <eos> I led you into the garden of my loneliness <eos> Wished that you left before it all burned down <eos> Oh, Julia <eos> I'm sorry what I do to ya <eos> I push and pull and mess with your head <eos> Then get in your bed 'cause I'm weak deep down <eos> Oh, Julia <eos> I wish I never lied to ya <eos> I never meant to hurt you like that <eos> And if I could go back, I'd leave you alone <eos> I won't lie to you no more <eos> I won't lie to you no more <eos> 'Cause I know I did before <eos> Hope you find what you're looking for <eos> 
Sweetheart, I've been trying so hard to get over you, just simply can't <eos> 'Cause the love we shared through the years meant so much to me <eos> All I'm lookin' for is just a serious relationship <eos> Someone I can hold all my life <eos> Why don't you give me that commitment? <eos> Let's settle down, let's chill <eos> Don't be afraid of me, I know my love is scaring you <eos> But I promise everything will be alright <eos> Come closer <eos> Let me talk to you <eos> Let's chill <eos> Oh, oh, baby, hey, hey <eos> Let's chill <eos> Let's chill, baby <eos> From the first time I saw your face <eos> Girl, I knew I had to have you <eos> I wanted to wrap you with my warm embrace <eos> Visions of your lovely face <eos> All my love is for you <eos> Whatever you want, I will do <eos> You're the only one I want in my life <eos> For you, I'll make that sacrifice, oh <eos> (Let's chill) <eos> (And let's settle down) <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's what I wanna do <eos> Just me and you (Just me and you) <eos> Baby <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Come here, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's all <eos> (Just me and you) That's all <eos> I'm so happy to have you here, standing right by my side <eos> Is it a dream (Dream) or reality? (Reality) <eos> If it's a fantasy, please don't wake me <eos> All my love is for you <eos> Whatever you want, I will do <eos> You're the only one I want in my life <eos> For you, I'll make that sacrifice, so, baby, let's <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Settle down, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's what I want to do <eos> (Just me and you) Oh <eos> (Let's chill) Let's chill, baby <eos> (And let's settle down) Oh-oh, oh-oh <eos> (That's what I wanna do) I want to do <eos> (Just me and you) <eos> Come here, baby <eos> Come lay next to me <eos> Let's forget about the past and think about the future <eos> Let's get together baby <eos> Let's stay together <eos> Oh, oh <eos> Let's chill, baby <eos> (Let's chill) <eos> (And let's settle down) Settle down <eos> (That's what I wanna do) All in my mind <eos> (Just me and you) To do with you, baby <eos> (Let's chill) So, let's chill <eos> (And let's settle down) Come on, baby <eos> (That's what I wanna do) That's all I want to do with you <eos> (Just me and you) <eos> Forever and ever <eos> Ever and ever <eos> Ever and ever, always <eos> Forever and ever <eos> Ever and ever <eos> Ever and ever, always <eos>

Barefoot in the sand <eos> Wishing God would lend a hand <eos> Wave after wave comes crashing down <eos> Washing away a little more ground <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Walking along with the ocean at my heels <eos> Loving the way the water feels <eos> Up in the sky something catches my eye <eos> As bright as a star in the northern sky <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> Seems to me that's how all things are <eos> Giving and taking little pink stars <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to feel you from the inside <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want the world to know that you're mine <eos> I want to touch you <eos> I want to touch you <eos> 
Paranoia is in bloom <eos> The PR transmissions will resume <eos> They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down <eos> And hope that we will never see the truth around <eos> (So come on) <eos> Another promise, another scene <eos> Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed <eos> And all the green belts wrapped around our minds <eos> And endless red tape to keep the truth confined <eos> (So come on) <eos> They will not force us <eos> They will stop degrading us <eos> They will not control us <eos> We will be victorious <eos> (So come on) <eos> Interchanging mind control <eos> Come let the revolution take its toll <eos> If you could flick the switch and open your third eye <eos> You'd see that we should never be afraid to die <eos> (So come on) <eos> Rise up and take the power back <eos> It's time the fat cats had a heart attack <eos> You know that their time's coming to an end <eos> We have to unify and watch our flag ascend <eos> (So come on) <eos> They will not force us <eos> They will stop degrading us <eos> They will not control us <eos> We will be victorious <eos> (So come on) <eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey <eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey <eos> They will not force us <eos> They will stop degrading us <eos> They will not control us <eos> We will be victorious <eos> (So come on) <eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey <eos> 
Blue jeans, white shirt <eos> Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn <eos> It was like James Dean for sure <eos> You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer <eos> You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop <eos> But you fit me better than my favorite sweater <eos> And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh) <eos> But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos> Big dreams, gangsta <eos> Said you had to leave to start your life over <eos> I was like, "No, please—stay here <eos> We don't need no money, we could make it all work" <eos> But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday <eos> I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing <eos> But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh) <eos> Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos> You went out every night, and baby, that's alright <eos> I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side <eos> 'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly <eos> Well, shit, at least you tried <eos> But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died <eos> Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind <eos> I just want it like before, we were dancing all night <eos> Then they took you away, stole you out of my life <eos> You just need to remember <eos> I will love you 'til the end of time <eos> I would wait a million years <eos> Promise you'll remember that you're mine <eos> Baby, can you see through the tears? <eos> Love you more than those bitches before <eos> Say you'll remember (Oh, baby), say you'll remember <eos> Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time <eos>

We passed upon the stairs <eos> We spoke of was and when <eos> Although I wasn't there <eos> He said I was his friend <eos> Which came as a surprise <eos> I spoke into his eyes <eos> I thought you died alone <eos> A long long time ago <eos> Oh no, not me <eos> We never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos> I laughed and shook his hand <eos> And made my way back home <eos> I searched for foreign land <eos> For years and years I roamed <eos> I gazed a gazely stare <eos> We walked a million hills <eos> I must have died alone <eos> A long, long time ago <eos> Who knows? Not me <eos> I never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos> Who knows? Not me <eos> We never lost control <eos> You're face to face <eos> With the man who sold the world <eos> 
Whenever I'm with him <eos> Something inside <eos> Starts to burnin' <eos> And I'm filled with desire <eos> Could it be a devil in me <eos> Or is this the way love's supposed to be? <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Burnin' in my heart (It's like a heat wave) <eos> I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave) <eos> It's tearin' me apart <eos> Whenever he calls my name <eos> Soft, low, sweet and plain <eos> Right then, right then <eos> I feel that burning flame <eos> Has high blood pressure got a hold on me <eos> Or is this the way love's supposed to be? <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Burnin' in my heart (It's like a heat wave) <eos> I can't keep from cryin' (It's like a heat wave) <eos> It's tearin' me apart <eos> Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, heat wave <eos> Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, heat wave <eos> Sometimes I stare in space <eos> Tears all over my face <eos> I can't explain it, don't understand it <eos> I ain't never felt like this before <eos> Now, that funny feeling has me amazed <eos> Don't know what to do, my head's in a haze <eos> It's like a heat wave <eos> Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (But it's all right, girl) <eos> Oh (Go ahead, girl) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Well, it's all right, girl) <eos> Oh (Can't miss it, that's love, girl) <eos> I feel it burnin' (Don't pass up this chance) <eos> Right here in my heart (It sounds like a true romance) <eos> Don't you know it's like a heat wave? <eos> Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah (Burnin', burnin') <eos> Oh (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> Yeah, don't you know it's like a heat wave? <eos> Burnin' right here (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> In my heart (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos> Yeah- yeah, yeah-yeah (Burnin', burnin') <eos> Oh (Burnin', burnin', burnin') <eos>

I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Late nights on your pillow <eos> Love as fast as light <eos> Fading in to echoes <eos> In my ventricles <eos> I carry this cargo <eos> Sinking deeper down <eos> And though your love was shallow <eos> I managed to drown <eos> Is this how you're gonna make me look now? <eos> Is this how you're gonna walk right out? <eos> Then you'd better do it like a champion <eos> And break my heart once and for all <eos> Do you feel good knowing that you've won now? <eos> Do you get high when I hit my lows? <eos> Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion <eos> When you break my heart once and for all <eos> I keep bending barrels <eos> You take aim and shoot <eos> I'm on pins and needles <eos> Your skin's bulletproof <eos> Don't try to be noble <eos> Leaving me for dead <eos> And though your love is hollow <eos> I could use a hand <eos> Is this how you're gonna make me look now? <eos> Is this how you're gonna walk right out? <eos> Then you'd better do it like a champion <eos> And break my heart once and for all <eos> Do you feel good knowing that you've won now? <eos> Do you get high when I hit my lows? <eos> Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion <eos> When you break my heart once and for all <eos> Just break my heart once and for all <eos> Do you feel good knowing that you've won now? <eos> Do you get high when I hit my lows? <eos> Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion <eos> When you break my heart once and for all <eos> Yeah I hope you feel like you're a champion <eos> When you break my heart once and for all <eos>

Yo la vi de lejos y supe que era para mi <eos> Su forma de sonreír, en ella me perdí <eos> Me atreví a acercarme y su numero le pedí <eos> Nervios corrían dentro de mi <eos> No me pude resistir, le marque y le dije <eos> Yo quiero saber mas de ti <eos> Quizás y podríamos salir <eos> Tu di cuando voy por ti <eos> No me conoces pero tienes que confiar en mi <eos> Mi intención para ti <eos> Es solo hacerte feliz <eos> Quiero adueñarme de ti <eos> Yo solo quiero adueñarme de esos ojitos cafés <eos> Mirar para siempre <eos> Esa carita de ángel, yo quiero adueñarme <eos> De ese corazón grande, ganarme la llave <eos> Y desifrar la clave <eos> Yes it is baby! <eos> Puro Nivel Codiciado Mi Amor <eos> Puro DMG! <eos> Con el tiempo confianza agarramos entre los dos <eos> Al solo escuchar su voz <eos> Me encerraba en mi mundo <eos> Ella tiene una vibra y yo la estoy sintiendo <eos> I hit her up through the phone <eos> Pa' hablar solo un minuto <eos> Pero al hablarle el tiempo paso volando <eos> Un minuto ya pasó, ya nos amanecimos <eos> Se que tu tambien estas sintiendo lo mismo que yo <eos> Si no me hubieras colgado <eos> Yo quiero hacerte feliz, quiero adueñarme de ti <eos> Yo solo quiero adueñarme de esos ojitos cafés <eos> Mirar para siempre <eos> Esa carita de ángel, yo quiero adueñarme <eos> De ese corazón grande, ganarme la llave <eos> Y descifrar la clave <eos> 
I was under the dryer when the telegram came <eos> "Private John C. Miller was shot down in Vietnam" <eos> Through my tears I read, "No more information at this time" <eos> He's missing in action somewhere on the Delta Line <eos> And they say that I should be proud, he was fighting for me <eos> They say that I should be proud, those too blind to see <eos> But he wasn't fighting for me, my Johnny didn't have to fight for me <eos> He was fighting for the evils of society <eos> Now, I prayed night and day that my Johnny wouldn't die <eos> Love, faith, and hope was all that kept me alive <eos> Then six weeks later came that cold and heartless letter, "Private John Miller killed in action, number 54327" <eos> And they say that I should be proud, he was keeping me free <eos> They say that I should be proud, those too blind to see <eos> But he wasn't fighting for me, my Johnny didn't have to die for me, He was fighting for the evils of society <eos> They shipped him home with medals of honor and glory <eos> Even our local paper ran a front page story <eos> But the whole town came to praise him and said honored I should be <eos> But I don't want no silver star, just the good man they took from me <eos> Yet they tell me I should be proud, he was fighting for me <eos> They said that I should be proud, those too blind to see <eos> But he wasn't fighting for me, my Johnny didn't have to die for me <eos> He's a victim of the evils of society <eos> I should be proud, oh my Johnny <eos> They told me that I should be proud <eos> They just took my Johnny from me <eos> Told me that I should be proud <eos> Oh, I want my Johnny <eos> Told me that I should be proud <eos>

I hear the drums echoing tonight <eos> But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation <eos> She's coming in, 12:30 flight <eos> Her moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation <eos> I stopped an old man along the way <eos> Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies <eos> He turned to me as if to say <eos> "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you" <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> The wild dogs cry out in the night <eos> As they grow restless longing for some solitary company <eos> I know that I must do what's right <eos> As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti <eos> I seek to cure what's deep inside <eos> Frightened of this thing that I've become <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you <eos> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you <eos> There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> I bless the rains down in Africa <eos> Gonna take some time to do the things we never had <eos> 
This is much better than it ever was before <eos> And next year, I better have my foot in the door <eos> 'Cause all along, I felt it all so much <eos> Now I'm feeling strong <eos> But hard work seems to get me nowhere <eos> So ears to the wall and listen for one shred of hope <eos> (And I can't) ignore the sound of good to come <eos> This time next year <eos> Nothing is better than making my own day <eos> But anything is better than wasting away <eos> When all along, I let them get to me <eos> But not for long, 'cause this time next year, I'll be listening <eos> So ears to the wall and listen for one shred of hope <eos> (And I can't) ignore the sound of good to come <eos> This time next year <eos> You can get next to me, but you can't read my mind <eos> I'll have faith in... <eos> I gotta have faith in, in what no one else will <eos> I'll have faith in... <eos> I gotta have faith in, in what no one else will <eos> I'll have faith in... <eos> I'll have faith in, in what no one else will <eos>

Hey, next girl, you don't know me <eos> I'm just the one he says went crazy on him <eos> That's just what he does <eos> But once upon a time I was the next girl <eos> I've been where you're at <eos> You overlook a lot when he looks like that <eos> He'll charm your mama with that smile <eos> Hide the red flags for a little while <eos> I bet you probably met him at a bar <eos> Let him walk you to your car <eos> I bet he said he never falls this hard <eos> Yeah, I remember that part <eos> He knows how to say all the right things <eos> Knows how to gеt you outta that dress <eos> Knows how to make you think you're thе best thing <eos> But I know what happens next, girl <eos> Hey, next girl, you think that you know better <eos> Maybe the last girl was just a little bitter and jaded <eos> Yeah, there ain't no doubt <eos> But if he ever talks about the ex girl <eos> She tried like hell <eos> It was too late to save herself <eos> So now she's just tryna help the next girl <eos> I bet you probably met him at a bar <eos> Let him walk you to your car <eos> I bet he said he never falls this hard <eos> Yeah, I remember that part <eos> He knows how to say all the right things <eos> Knows how to get you outta that dress <eos> Knows how to make you think you're the best thing <eos> But I know what happens next <eos> You're gonna think it's all your fault <eos> It's just a switch that he turns off <eos> He'll make you think it's love <eos> But I promise you, it's not <eos> Oh no, it's not, no <eos> Oh, and I bet you probably met him at a bar <eos> Let him walk you to your car <eos> I bet he said he never falls this hard <eos> Yeah, I remember that part <eos> He knows how to say all the right things <eos> Knows how to get you outta that dress <eos> Knows how to make you think you're the best thing <eos> But I know what happens next, girl <eos> 
In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> 
It's not in the way that you hold me <eos> It's not in the way you say you care <eos> It's not in the way you've been treating my friends <eos> It's not in the way that you stayed till the end <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> It's not in the words that you told me <eos> It's not in the way you say you're mine <eos> It's not in the way that you came back to me <eos> It's not in the way that your love set me free <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> It's not in the words that you told me <eos> It's not in the way you say you're mine <eos> It's not in the way that you came back to me <eos> It's not in the way that your love set me free <eos> It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Hold the line <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Love isn't always on time <eos> Whoah-ooh-ooh <eos> 
I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> 
Every second counts <eos> I don't wanna talk to you anymore, and <eos> All these little games <eos> You can call me by the name I gave you yesterday, yeah <eos> Every minute counts <eos> I don't wanna watch TV anymore, yeah <eos> Can you figure me out? <eos> Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch <eos> Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time <eos> I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine <eos> Can you see me using everything to hold back? <eos> I guess this could be worse <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Pour your glass of wine <eos> Mitchell told me I should be just fine (Yeah) <eos> Cases under the bed <eos> Spill it open, let it rush to my head <eos> I don't wanna be forward, I don't wanna cut corners <eos> Savor this with everything I have inside of me <eos> I'm not the type to run <eos> I know that we're having fun <eos> But what's the rush? Kissing, then my cheeks are so flushed <eos> Tell you how I felt <eos> Sugar coated melting in your mouth <eos> Pardon my emotions <eos> I should probably keep it all to myself <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Know you'd make fun of me <eos> Can you see me? I'm waiting for the right time <eos> I can't read you, but if you want, the pleasure's all mine <eos> Can you see me using everything to hold back? <eos> I guess this could be worse <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos> Walking out the door with your bags <eos>

I'm jealous of the rain <eos> That falls upon your skin <eos> It's closer than my hands have been <eos> I'm jealous of the rain <eos> I'm jealous of the wind <eos> That ripples through your clothes <eos> It's closer than your shadow <eos> Oh, I'm jealous of the wind <eos> I wished you the best of <eos> All this world could give <eos> And I told you when you left me <eos> There's nothing to forgive <eos> But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was <eos> Heartbreak and misery <eos> It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way <eos> You're happy without me <eos> I'm jealous of the nights <eos> That I don't spend with you <eos> I'm wondering who you lay next to <eos> Oh, I'm jealous of the nights <eos> I'm jealous of the love <eos> Love that was in here <eos> Gone for someone else to share <eos> Oh, I'm jealous of the love, 'cause <eos> I wished you the best of <eos> All this world could give <eos> And I told you when you left me <eos> There's nothing to forgive <eos> But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was <eos> Heartbreak and misery <eos> It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way <eos> You're happy without me <eos> As I sink in the sand <eos> Watch you slip through my hands <eos> Oh, as I die here another day <eos> 'Cause all I do is cry behind this smile <eos> I wished you the best of <eos> All this world could give <eos> And I told you when you left me <eos> There's nothing to forgive <eos> But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was <eos> Heartbreak and misery <eos> It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way <eos> You're happy without me-e-e-eee <eos> It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way <eos> You're happy without me <eos> 
Morning scatters in and I am steady like a drug <eos> Feeling out this one <eos> She wakes up smashed as hell and steadies her ass against the rail <eos> And bends before the pounding rain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas all along about my love <eos> And I need this fucking fix and I beg her to pick from <eos> One of a million ways to feel no pain <eos> The morning after bends reflected in and I can hardly stand <eos> The way this whole thing makes me seem <eos> She climbs out from a dream with lungs hardening <eos> She screams a stereo scream <eos> And bends before astounding rain <eos> She's got a system made of metal with magnet bits inside her brain <eos> She opens her box of tricks and begs me to pick from <eos> One of a billion ways to feel no pain <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me uptight, let me breathe now <eos> She had the widest bright ideas <eos> That all the world would sleep away until the nightmare ends <eos> Everyone is on <eos> Wait <eos> Wait on the end <eos> Hold me upright, let me breathe now <eos> 
Well I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> Yes, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> With my brother standing by <eos> I said <eos> Brother, you know, you know <eos> It's a long road we've been walking on <eos> Yes it is,  yes it is, you know it is <eos> Such a long road we've been walking on <eos> Oh, brother, oh, brother <eos> And I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> With my sister standing by <eos> I said <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Here is what I know now <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Oh, but you know I am so weary <eos> And you know <eos> My heart, my heart's been broken now <eos> Sometimes <eos> Sometimes <eos> My mind is too strong to carry on <eos> Too strong, too strong to carry on <eos> But when I am alone <eos> When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone <eos> When I've lost all care for the things I own <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> That's when I miss you <eos> You who are my home <eos> You who are my home now <eos> And here is what I know now, brother <eos> Here is what I know now, sister <eos> Goes like this <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> My salvation lies <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> In your love <eos> Your love now <eos> Well, I had a dream <eos> I stood beneath an orange sky <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by now <eos> With my brother and my sister standing by <eos>

Well I chased her down the alley <eos> And over the hill to steal her will <eos> She was as hot as Georgia asphalt <eos> When the "A" crowd came to adore her brain <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> You should've seen her back in the city <eos> Poetry and jewels, broke all the rules <eos> She was as high as a Georgia pine tree <eos> Makeup and pills, overdue bills <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> Some sunny day when the hands of time <eos> Have had their way <eos> You'll understand why it was so hard to run away <eos> She's a loser she's a forgiver <eos> But she still finds good where no one could <eos> You ought to want her more than money <eos> Cadillacs and rust diamonds and dust <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> So leave Virginia alone <eos> Leave Virginia alone <eos> She's not like you and me <eos> She's not like you and me <eos>

When we met, it all happened so fast <eos> You said you loved me <eos> And that it would last <eos> But now it seems that it was all a lie <eos> And all my love for you will soon pass you by <eos> My love for you will never be the same <eos> My heart still aches <eos> From the sorrow and the pain <eos> Time has come for me to say goodbye <eos> Although the precious times <eos> Will never leave my mind <eos> Why did you have to change on me <eos> Your love was so easy and sweet <eos> Oh boy, I gave you all my time <eos> But why couldn't I make you mine <eos> Changing your love was the best thing to do <eos> My love wasn't strong for both me and you <eos> You go your own way, baby <eos> And I'll go mine <eos> Searching for the love we both hope to find <eos> If you decide to come back to me <eos> I'll be waiting so desperately <eos> Until then, I will find <eos> Someone to love me all of the time <eos> My love for you will never be the same <eos> My heart still aches <eos> From the sorrow and the pain <eos> Time has come for me to say goodbye <eos> Although the precious times <eos> Will never leave my mind <eos>

A growing sickness in the heart <eos> Defective, lack of control <eos> The cure is somewhere in the silence <eos> But I'm crushed by the noise inside <eos> Don't lock the door on me <eos> You'd kill me, face down, dead <eos> Another part of me falls for you <eos> Another day in the dark <eos> No, no <eos> Stranded in the night <eos> Stranded in the cold <eos> Don't lock the door on me <eos> You'd kill me, face down, dead <eos> Another part of you gone to waste <eos> Please hear me out <eos> You kill me, face down, dead <eos> Another day in the dark <eos> Don't lock the door on me <eos> You'd kill me, face down, dead <eos> Another part of you gone to waste <eos> Please hear me out <eos> You kill me, face down, dead <eos> Another day in the dark <eos> Leave the moment alone <eos> Leave the moment alone <eos> Leave the moment alone <eos> Leave the moment alone <eos> 
You were a child crawling on your knees toward it <eos> Making mama so proud but your voice is too loud <eos> We like to watch you laughing <eos> You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> The water is warm but it's sending me shivers <eos> A baby is born crying out for attention <eos> The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror <eos> Decision to decisions are made and not bought <eos> But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not <eos> Control yourself, take only what you need from it <eos> A family of trees wanted to be haunted <eos> 
You never act aloud the way you appear <eos> My every breath awakes alarms in your ears <eos> I'm not confused, it's just you're making me think <eos> Of all our conversations missing their link <eos> I wanna know all the dreams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I plan to take <eos> And I hope you won't care <eos> But all your makeup's running <eos> And I'm walking you home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> I see you more at night then you do the day <eos> I'm more concerned for what you'll leave if you stay <eos> I'm not confused, it's just I don't wanna talk <eos> It seems the key was not to peek through the locks <eos> So I wanna hear all the screams that you keep beneath <eos> I want the words that you whisper when I'm asleep <eos> Wanna give back the things that I never take <eos> And I know you don't care <eos> But all those pretty people are still going home <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> And my dick takes over <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout your lips <eos> But we're too damn sober <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> For mistakes like this <eos> Like this, like this, like this <eos> 
Fuck... <eos> Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road <eos> Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go <eos> So make the best of this test, and don't ask why <eos> It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> So take the photographs and still frames in your mind <eos> Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time <eos> Tattoos of memories, and dead skin on trial <eos> For what it's worth, it was worth all the while <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life <eos> It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right <eos> I hope you had the time of your life... <eos> 
Aha, ayy, aha <eos> Man, come on, man, don't leave, fuck <eos> What the fuck? Why you leave me on read? <eos> I don't like this, fuck, ahh <eos> If I told you what I'm thinkin' 'bout <eos> It's hard to say to you, but <eos> I just know that I need some time alone <eos> It's all I think about at night <eos> I need some time away from you <eos> Can't even be in the same room <eos> I think I'm going crazy <eos> Been home and lonely lately <eos> What do you think about me? <eos> Can you fight or will you flee? <eos> Call me, you got my number <eos> Don't let me go yet, lover <eos> You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone <eos> You know that I know <eos> That you're not comin' home <eos> These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown <eos> To drown <eos> Perdido en mi mente y buscando paraíso <eos> But I can not find that si no estás aquí conmigo <eos> Don't know what you're doin' and I don't know who you with <eos> En ruinas, reina, siento yo que me quedé <eos> Con mis esperanzas falsas, casi siento que me matan <eos> Regresa conmigo, amor, where did we go? <eos> I need some time away from you <eos> Can't even be in the same room <eos> I think I'm going crazy <eos> Been home and lonely lately <eos> What do you think about me? <eos> Can you fight or will you flee? <eos> Call me, you got my number <eos> Don't let me go yet, lover <eos> You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone <eos> You know, that I know <eos> That you're not comin' home <eos> These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown <eos> To drown <eos> Stuck inside my mind, I think I’ve lost it all <eos> Free me from my thoughts, I think I've fallen off <eos> Memories don't return, they seem to run away <eos> Dreamin' of a world where I would wanna stay <eos> You're gone, I'm done, I'm all alone <eos> You know, that I know <eos> That you're not coming home <eos> These days, I’m lost, you left me to drown <eos> To drown <eos>

Yo he peleado con cocodrilos <eos> Me he balanceado sobre un hilo cargando más de quinientos kilos <eos> Le he dado la vuelta al mundo en menos de un segundo <eos> He cruzado 100 laberintos y nunca me confundo <eos> Respiro dentro y fuera del agua como las focas <eos> Soy a prueba de fuego, agarro balas con la boca <eos> Mi creatividad vuela como los aviones <eos> Puedo construir un cerebro sin leer las instrucciones <eos> Hablo todos los idiomas de todos los abecedarios <eos> Tengo más vocabulario que cualquier diccionario <eos> Tengo vista de águila, olfato de perro <eos> Puedo caminar descalzo sobre clavos de hierro <eos> Soy inmune a la muerte <eos> No necesito bendiciones porque siempre tengo buena suerte <eos> Ven conmigo a dar un paseo por el parque <eos> Porque tengo más cuentos que contarte que García Márquez <eos> Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti <eos> Es que tú me sacas lo mejor de mí <eos> Soy todo lo que soy <eos> Porque tú eres todo lo que quiero <eos> Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti <eos> Es que tú me sacas lo mejor de mí <eos> Soy todo lo que soy <eos> Porque tú eres todo lo que quiero <eos> Puedo brincar la cuerda con solo una pierna <eos> Veo en la oscuridad sin usar una linterna <eos> Cocino lo que quieras, yo soy todo un chef <eos> Tengo sexo 24/7 todo el mes <eos> Puedo soplar las nubes grises pa' que tengas un buen día <eos> También sé como comunicarme por telepatía <eos> Por ti, cruzo la frontera sin visa <eos> Y le saco una buena sonrisa a la Mona Lisa <eos> Por ti, respiro antes de morirme <eos> Por ti voy a la Iglesia y escucho toda la misa sin dormirme <eos> Sigo siendo el rey, aunque no tenga reino <eos> Mi sudor huele a perfume y nunca me despeino <eos> Sé pelear todas las artes marciales <eos> También se como comunicarme con los animales <eos> Mientras más pasa el tiempo me veo más joven <eos> Esta canción la compuse sin escuchar como Beethoven <eos> Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti <eos> Es que tú me sacas lo mejor de mí <eos> Soy todo lo que soy <eos> Porque tú eres todo lo que quiero <eos> Por ti, todo lo que hago lo hago por ti <eos> Es que tú me sacas lo mejor de mí <eos> Soy todo lo que soy <eos> Porque tú eres todo lo que quiero <eos> 
Come as you are, as you were <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a friend, as a friend <eos> As an old enemy <eos> Take your time, hurry up <eos> Choice is yours, don't be late <eos> Take a rest as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach <eos> As I want you to be <eos> As a trend, as a friend <eos> As an old memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria (No, I don't have a gun) <eos> And I swear that I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> No, I don't have a gun <eos> Memoria <eos> Memoria <eos> 
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You really are a heel <eos> You're as cuddly as a cactus <eos> You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch <eos> You're a bad banana with a greasy black peel! <eos> You're a monster, Mr. Grinch <eos> Your heart's an empty hole <eos> Your brain is full of spiders <eos> You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch <eos> I wouldn't touch you with a thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole! <eos> You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You have termites in your smile <eos> You have all the tender sweetness <eos> Of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch <eos> Given the choice between the two of you <eos> I'd take the seasick crocodile! <eos> You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch <eos> You're a nasty wasty skunk <eos> Your heart is full of unwashed socks <eos> Your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch <eos> The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote <eos> "Stink, stank, stunk!" <eos> You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch <eos> You're the king of sinful sots <eos> Your heart's a dead tomato splotched <eos> With moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch <eos> Your soul is an appalling dump heap <eos> Overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable <eos> Mangled up in tangled up knots! <eos> You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch <eos> With a nauseous super "naus" <eos> You're a crooked dirty jockey <eos> And you drive a crooked horse, Mr. Grinch <eos> You're a three-decker sauerkraut <eos> And toadstool sandwich with arsenic sauce! <eos> 

THE EPIMETHEAN TRIUMVIRATE IS ASCENDANT! <eos> Beyond constellations known to man <eos> A type III spectral asteroid <eos> Ancient worlds where all life began <eos> Conjured by beings from beyond the void <eos> Quantum black distortion fields <eos> Imperial might now doomed to fall <eos> When gleams the eldritch mystic seal <eos> The great filter comes for us all <eos> Power! Now mine to claim <eos> I shall reap this planet's grave <eos> Within the timeless sands <eos> Elucidation now at hand <eos> A path of luminescent sigils guide me to the crater <eos> What mystery of the dеsert lies beforе me?! <eos> In the anteboreal wasteland <eos> An onyx gate appears <eos> Non-euclidean mystic portal <eos> With a message from the spheres <eos> If seek ye ancient wisdom <eos> Cast off thy mortal shell <eos> And traverse the forbidden gateway <eos> Into the unknown astral realm <eos> Thanatos! I yield to thee <eos> The price that I must pay <eos> For the infinite omnispatial knowledge of the cosmos <eos> Across the threshold of the void <eos> Between the boundless dimensions <eos> Under the spell of night <eos> Endless fractal recursions <eos> Quantum convergence in sight <eos> Ensorcelled tendrils <eos> Entwine my dying flesh <eos> With nano-particles <eos> The nexus interface <eos> Merging with my brain <eos> From death's cold embrace <eos> I SHALL RISE! <eos> Forbidden equations <eos> Reveal their truths to me <eos> Behold omnipotence synchronised <eos> Between the boundless dimensions <eos> Under the spell of night <eos> Endless fractal recursions <eos> Quantum convergence in sight <eos> In the depths of the Epimethean wasteland <eos> I have ascended <eos> Beyond this plane <eos> I wield the secrets of the stars <eos> 
Get out tonight <eos> From the deafening sound inside <eos> That I’ll deny <eos> But it feels like I’m right <eos> I’m feeling alright <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> Cut down to size <eos> Paralyzed <eos> Low tide <eos> Wait to rise <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos> You lye, you lye, you lye <eos> Until you decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> You decompose <eos> Until you... <eos> Light up <eos> No, blow it out <eos> Neurotic <eos> The flower burns <eos> Sinking down to the bone <eos> And you lye, lye, lye <eos> Decompose <eos> Decompose <eos>

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart <eos> Without saying a word you can light up the dark <eos> Try as I may I could never explain <eos> What I hear when you don't say a thing <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> All day long I can hear people talking out loud <eos> But when you hold me near you drown out the crowd <eos> Old Mister Webster could never define <eos> What's being said between your heart and mine <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos> The smile on your face lets me know that you need me <eos> There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me <eos> A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall <eos> Now you say it best when you say nothing at all <eos>

(Tenement slum <eos> Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah) <eos> You think that I don't feel love <eos> But what I feel for you is real love <eos> In those eyes, I see reflected <eos> A hurt, scorned, rejected <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, born in poverty <eos> Love child, never meant to be <eos> Love child, take a look at me <eos> Started my life in an old, cold, rundown <eos> Tenement slum (Tenement slum) <eos> My father left, he never even married Mom <eos> I shared the guilt my mama knew <eos> So afraid that others knew I had no name <eos> Ah, this love we're contemplating <eos> Is worth the pain of waiting <eos> We'll only end up hating <eos> The child we may be creating <eos> Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child (Scorned by) society <eos> Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, different from the rest <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> (Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby <eos> I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out) <eos> I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt <eos> To be without the simple things <eos> So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me <eos> Ah, don't think that I don't need you <eos> Don't think I don't wanna please you <eos> But no child of mine will be bearing <eos> The name of shame I've been wearing <eos> Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> You (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos> Love child, love child (Just a little bit longer, love child) <eos> I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on) <eos>

We've been to both Carolinas <eos> Seen a big Montana sky <eos> Driven up and down a coast a few times <eos> London, Paris, paradise <eos> But ain't got much memory of the scenes <eos> Come to think, I miss them all <eos> And damn, babe, it's all your fault <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach? <eos> You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea <eos> And the night rolled in <eos> And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall <eos> But God, I saw all I needed to <eos> Might as well have stayed in the room <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my) <eos> Don't you remember Times Square? <eos> And people counting down everywhere <eos> 2000-whatever, no, I didn't care <eos> 'Cause baby you were there <eos> And once again, couldn't help but stare <eos> No matter where we go <eos> No matter what we do <eos> If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> Halfway around the world <eos> Or the local corner booth <eos> Yeah, you guessed it, girl <eos> You know I got my eyes on you <eos> We could be on any street <eos> Any party, any room <eos> I'll be there all night with my eyes on you <eos> Don't matter where we've been <eos> No, there ain't no better view <eos> Than you in my arms with my eyes on you <eos> 
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear <eos> And I, I can't help but ask myself <eos> How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer <eos> It's driven me before <eos> And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal <eos> But lately I'm <eos> Beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos> So if I decide to waiver my chance <eos> To be one of the hive <eos> Will I choose water over wine <eos> And hold my own and drive? <eos> Oh <eos> It's driven me before <eos> And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around <eos> But lately I'm <eos> Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos> Would you choose water over wine? <eos> Hold the wheel and drive <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> With open arms and open eyes, yeah <eos> Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there <eos> I’ll be there <eos>

Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> You don't know how lucky you are <eos> You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin' <eos> For something bound to fall apart <eos> Everytime you're feeling empty <eos> Better thank your lucky stars <eos> If you ever felt one breaking <eos> You'd never want a heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> You don't know how lucky you are <eos> I've been on the road that you're on <eos> It didn't get me very far <eos> You ain't missing nothing <eos> 'Cause love is so damn hard <eos> Take it from me darling <eos> You don't want a heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> Hey there Mr. Tin Man <eos> I'm glad we talked this out <eos> You can take mine if you want it <eos> It's in pieces now <eos> By the way there Mr. Tin Man <eos> If you don't mind the scars <eos> You give me your armor <eos> And you can have my heart <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo-oo <eos> Oo <eos> 
I wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight <eos> I wouldn't even put up a fight <eos> I wouldn't care if you took it all away today <eos> I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain <eos> But I know I've got to live my life <eos> And roll around on the ground and feel the strife <eos> And realize along the way that I'm nothing more than <eos> A grain of salt in the salt of the earth, and everything is grace <eos> So come on with the darkness <eos> Come on with the fear <eos> Cause I've got to start somewhere <eos> And it might as well be here <eos> And when I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight <eos> I'll look back at all this selfishness and foolish pride <eos> And laugh at myself, laugh at myself <eos> Laugh at myself, laugh at myself <eos> Laugh at myself <eos> 
I can see it in your eyes <eos> See it in your face <eos> Bangin' on your chest <eos> Actin' tough, lookin' unfazed <eos> Trippin' over landlines <eos> Cuttin' deep with a dull blade <eos> Running out of unrest <eos> Goin' out of your mind <eos> Lonely days will follow, days will follow <eos> And the gaze that stuck the halls will know your name <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> I can see it with my own eyes <eos> The tracks down your face <eos> It can't be easy tryna unwind <eos> Sleepin' on your daydreams <eos> I'm not tryna role-play <eos> These things can make us take the wheel <eos> These days can break <eos> But I'm gonna take the wheel <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> Bet on the winners <eos> Worst of you's born to lose <eos> Bed with no dinner <eos> The rest of you's born to lose <eos> Better than zero <eos> Worst of you's born to lose <eos> Bet on the winners <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Ooh, ooh, ooh) <eos> Hit me like a tidal wave  (Ooh) <eos> Triggered by the aftershock <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (Triggered by the aftershock) <eos> (Aftershock, the aftershock) <eos> (The aftershock) <eos> 
Something has to change <eos> Undeniable dilemma <eos> Boredom's not a burden <eos> Anyone should bear <eos> Constant over-stimulation numbs me <eos> But I would not want you any other way <eos> Just not enough <eos> I need more <eos> Nothing seems to satisfy <eos> I said I don't want it <eos> I just need it <eos> To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive <eos> Finger deep within the borderline <eos> Show me that you love me and that we belong together <eos> Relax, turn around and take my hand <eos> I can help you change <eos> Tired moments into pleasure <eos> Say the word and we'll be <eos> Well upon our way <eos> Blend and balance <eos> Pain and comfort deep within you <eos> 'Til you will not want me any other way <eos> It's not enough <eos> I need more <eos> Nothing seems to satisfy <eos> I said I don't want it <eos> I just need it <eos> To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive <eos> Knuckle deep inside the borderline <eos> This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to <eos> Relax, slip away <eos> Chupa minha pica bicha <eos> Chupa minha pica bicha <eos> Chupa minha pica bicha <eos> Something kinda sad about <eos> The way that things have come to be <eos> Desensitized to everything <eos> What became of subtlety? <eos> How can this mean anything to me <eos> If I really don't feel anything at all? <eos> I'll keep digging <eos> 'Til I feel something <eos> Elbow deep inside the borderline <eos> Show me that you love me and that we belong together <eos> Shoulder deep within the borderline <eos> Relax, turn around and take my hand <eos> 
I used to walk home all alone <eos> It used to be so sad <eos> I used to be all by myself <eos> It used to be so bad <eos> Until you <eos> You came along <eos> And took me by the hand <eos> Until you <eos> You came along <eos> And said that you would be my man <eos> Now I'm jumping up and down <eos> Spinning all around <eos> Because of you, babe <eos> I'm as happy as can be <eos> And it's definitely <eos> Because of you babe <eos> Just because of you <eos> I used to go to bed at night <eos> Wishing I had a friend <eos> Someone to hold and squeeze me tight <eos> A very special friend <eos> Until you <eos> You came along <eos> And told me you would be the one <eos> Until you <eos> You came along <eos> And held me in your arms <eos> You are a dream come true <eos> And there's nothing in this world <eos> I wouldn't do <eos> Baby, just for you <eos> Baby, I love you <eos> I love you <eos> 
Thinking about quitting <eos> Think it's time now <eos> Thinking it's all over <eos> Quiet in my mind <eos> Everybody's laughing <eos> Everybody's sure <eos> Nothing seems likely <eos> Nothing's unknown <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and <eos> You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Maybe I'm grieving <eos> Maybe I'm dead <eos> Maybe I'm leaving <eos> My heart's like lead <eos> Something feels missing <eos> Something ain't right <eos> Remember first kissing <eos> My heart felt wide <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and <eos> You know I always feel like the blinds are drawing <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Oh, nothing last forever <eos> Oh, nothing suits me better <eos> Oh, I don't feel so clever <eos> But I'm tryin' to improve, oh-oh-oh <eos> So hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Yeah, everything's gonna be just fine <eos> So hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be alright <eos> Hey, hey, my, my <eos> Everything's gonna be just fine <eos> Did you ever feel like everything's falling? (Yeah, yeah) <eos> To fly like an eagle into the dawn and (Oh yeah) <eos> You know I always feel like the skies are falling (Oh-oh, yeah) <eos> To fly like an eagle and dare to reborn and <eos> 
We were all down at Margie's bar <eos> Telling stories if we had one <eos> Someone fired the old jukebox up <eos> The song sure was a sad one <eos> A teardrop rolled down Bubba's nose <eos> From the pain the song was inflicting <eos> And all at once he jumped to his feet <eos> Just like somebody kicked him <eos> Bubba shot the juke box last night <eos> Said it played a sad song it made him cry <eos> Went to his truck and got a forty five <eos> Bubba shot the juke box last night <eos> Bubba ain't never been accused of being mentality stable <eos> So we did not draw an easy breath <eos> Until he laid that colt on the table <eos> He hung his head till the cops showed up <eos> They dragged him right out of Margie's <eos> Told him "Don't you play dumb with us, son" <eos> "Know damn well what the charge is." <eos> Bubba shot the juke box last night <eos> Said it played a sad song it made him cry <eos> Went to his truck and got a forty five <eos> Well, he shot the juke box last night <eos> Well, the sheriff arrived with his bathrobe on <eos> The confrontation was a tense one <eos> Shook his head and said, "Bubba Boy," <eos> "You was always a dense one." <eos> Reckless discharge of a gun <eos> That's what the officers are claiming <eos> Bubba hollered, "Reckless! Hell!" <eos> "I hit just where I was aiming." <eos> Bubba shot the juke box last night <eos> Said it played a sad song it made him cry <eos> Went to his truck and got a forty five <eos> Well, he shot the juke box stopped it with one shot <eos> Bubba shot the jukebox last night <eos> Well, he could not tell right from wrong <eos> Through the teardrops in his eyes <eos> Beyond a shadow of a doubt <eos> It was justifiable homicide <eos> Bubba shot the juke box stopped it with one shot <eos> Bubba shot the jukebox last night <eos> 
Duele dejarlo así <eos> No fue lo que pedimos <eos> Duele pensarnos y no <eos> Vernos aquí <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? Ohh <eos> Duele dejarlo ir <eos> Todo lo que vivimos <eos> Como verlo en un libro <eos> Un diario del ayer <eos> Ahhh <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> Duеle pensarlo así <eos> No puedo digеrirlo, amor <eos> Fue lo que no dijimos <eos> Lo que quedó por dar. Ahh <eos> Cómo se nos durmió tanto amor <eos> Que un adiós se estrello aquí? <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> Baby ven y dime que no es cierto <eos> Baby yo, te lo juro que no entiendo <eos> Baby ven y dime que no es cierto <eos> Baby yo, baby yo <eos> Y ahora en tu playa que se encallan mis besos <eos> Y se me callan de duda los versos <eos> No es cierto <eos> Baby di que no es cierto. Ohh <eos> No es cierto <eos> 
Te quiero asi <eos> Deliciosa insospechada <eos> Porque creo en tu palabra <eos> Porque yo siento que aun te necesito <eos> Porque me alteras las ganas <eos> Te quiero asi estuendosa y delicada <eos> Entre alegria y nostalgia <eos> Porque me gusta tenerte vida mia <eos> Y no quiero que te vayas <eos> Porque el amor <eos> Cuando es verdad sale del alma <eos> Nos aturden los sentidos <eos> Y de pronto descubrimos <eos> Que la piel se enciende en llamas <eos> Chorus <eos> Bien <eos> Tu amor me hace bien <eos> Tu amor me desarma <eos> Ay tu amor me controla <eos> Eh oh me endulza, me encanta <eos> Pero bien <eos> Tu amor me hace bien <eos> Tu amor me desarma <eos> Ay tu amor me controla <eos> Eh oh me vence, me amarra <eos> Eh eh dile que me hace bien  <eos> Ay que me hace bien <eos> Te quiero asi <eos> Tan precisa y vocada <eos> Con tus detalles que matan <eos> Porque tenerte a mi lado me hace fuerte <eos> Si eres mi reina y mi espada <eos> Te quiero asi cuando ries cuando callas <eos> Porque al caer me levantas <eos> Porque mi voz sin espiritu se agita <eos> Cuando dices que me amas <eos> Porque tu amor <eos> Como es verdad me envuelve el alma <eos> Me despierta los sentidos <eos> Y de pronto descubri que aqui en mi piel <eos> Se encienden llamas <eos> Bien <eos> Tu amor me hace bien <eos> Tu amor me desarma <eos> Ay tu amor me controla <eos> Eh oh me endulza, me encanta <eos> Ay como te quiero <eos> Ay como te adoro <eos> Ay lolita linda eres mi tesoro <eos> Es que me vuelves loco <eos>

Just like that neon sign, I'm buzzing <eos> Just like that full moon, I'm so high <eos> No, it's not what you think, it's not from the drink <eos> It's not from something I'm smoking <eos> Makes me feel like I can fly <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> When I fall and hit rock bottom <eos> When my star comes crashing to the ground <eos> My soft place to land, my steady right hand <eos> You make it all good, you make me feel like a man <eos> You lift me up, you never let me down <eos> Lord knows that you never let me down <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, all my dreams come true <eos> Come morning light waking up next to you, right next to you <eos> Soft candle light, California red <eos> I can't keep my boots on the ground tonight when they're underneath your bed, baby <eos> When you're in these arms of mine <eos> I'm up on cloud nine <eos> On the dance floor floating around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> I never want this night to end <eos> You got me three sheets to the wind <eos> Like a record we're spinning around <eos> And I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Yeah, you're looking so fine, you got me up on cloud nine <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> Come on kiss me and then, kiss me again and again <eos> Yeah, baby, I can't keep my boots on the ground <eos> 
As long as time keeps ticking, long as people have to cry <eos> When I see loved ones leaving, saying last goodbyes <eos> I believe these blues are never gonna die <eos> When I see bad things happen to good folks everyday <eos> Children going hungry with nothin’ on their plates <eos> I believe these blues won’t ever go away <eos> People try to end their troubles by drinking whiskey down <eos> But I believe these blues will always be around <eos> I can’t tell the future but I can play my song <eos> I can’t tell the future but I sho' 'nuf can play my song <eos> And I believe these blues will go on and on and on <eos> 
Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo <eos> Caigo de nuevo en tu red <eos> Sé que tarda un tiempo <eos> Curarme de ti de una vez <eos> Tuve tantos momentos felices <eos> Que olvido lo triste que fue <eos> Darte de mi alma <eos> Lo que tú echaste a perder <eos> Yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> Y en la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Tienes, la misma culpa que tengo <eos> Aunque te cueste admitir <eos> Que sientes como siento <eos> La almohada no suele mentir <eos> Y yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer <eos> Cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos>

Nothing's wrong, and it's not what I'm used to <eos> Oh, does it surprise you too? <eos> When it's simple, is it easier than it should be? <eos> Nothing's wrong, but when you're not in my arms <eos> I send voice notes, you send hearts <eos> And get quiet, and I know that means you miss me <eos> You're jealous, you shouldn't be <eos> I want you obsessively <eos> But I know how complicated it can get <eos> When you're not in front of me <eos> I know insecurities get in your head <eos> But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes, get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Nothing's wrong, I just get in my head too <eos> Can you reassure me you, you're still in it? <eos> I just wish you could lean in and kiss me <eos> Say nothing's wrong, tell me to settle down <eos> You do it better than I've ever known how <eos> Won't pull some tricks for attention <eos> But could I get a little now? <eos> I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> You're jealous, you shouldn't be <eos> I want you obsessively <eos> But I know how complicated it can get <eos> When you're not in front of me <eos> I know insecurities get in your head <eos> But I'm not gonna interrupt if you need to talk about it <eos> Roll my eyes or get offended by the way you doubt it <eos> You know you're mine, you just forget sometimes <eos> So promise me you won’t <eos> And you know I'll remind you when you think I don't <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times before 7 AM <eos> I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times before 7 AM <eos> I love you <eos> How could you forget? <eos> I told you seventeen times <eos> Hey stupid, I love you <eos>

Hook: <eos> Small time Mexicana <eos> On the come up from the Eastside <eos> Ahora mírala <eos> X2 <eos> Verse 1: <eos> Raspado man <eos> Pour that syrup in my white foam cup <eos> Lot of POC <eos> Very little white folk stuff <eos> Looking real E <eos> But I got no sign thrown up <eos> I just feel me <eos> I ain’t tryna fight no one <eos> Know I’m in the East <eos> Even with my eyes closed shut <eos> Waiting in the streets <eos> Sometimes I would bike home t <eos> But the 22 and 25 were what I rode <eos> So the public transit was like my school bus <eos> He said let’s go to the Southside for fries <eos> I said "no manches guey <eos> You want it done right, ima take you straight to Santa Fe" <eos> He said "let’s go" <eos> I said "I’m already on the way" <eos> So much on the East <eos> That you really gotta contemplate <eos> This is where I reside <eos> La cultura aka Dickies and Levi’s <eos> It ain’t basura <eos> But it ain’t no pretty peace sign <eos> It’s where I grew up <eos> Yeah it’s the Eastside <eos> Hook <eos> Verse 2: <eos> Shouts to Karmen for the hustle and bustle <eos> Selling candy out her house <eos> She was one with the struggle <eos> Everyone on the block would go <eos> Even my cousins and uncles, sister and brother and grandmother, single lovers or couples <eos> It was the spot <eos> And any competition there was no <eos> You could get <eos> Shot <eos> I’m just kidding but we lived in no bubble <eos> We kept it locked <eos> For no unexpected visitor trouble <eos> We hear a knock <eos> Turn the light off, we don’t live here <eos> We unknown <eos> I’m in my place <eos> Chicanos, chicanas <eos> I’m with my race <eos> Fake beggars outside Tropicana <eos> Get out my face <eos> Bummin' in my pijamas <eos> But wide awake <eos> Do the work and we can be what we wanna <eos> Decide a fate <eos> Lotta real out here besides the fake <eos> Love is what I feel out here behind the hate <eos> It’s more than just the streetlights <eos> It’s where I grew up <eos> Yeah It’s the Eastside <eos> Hook <eos> 
And you can bring me to my knees again <eos> All the times that I could beg you please in vain <eos> All the times that I felt insecure for you <eos> And I leave my burdens at the door <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos> All the times that I felt like this won't end, it's for you <eos> And I taste what I could never have, it was from you <eos> All the times that I've cried <eos> My intentions, full of pride <eos> But I waste more time than anyone <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos> All the times that I've cried <eos> All this wasted, it's all inside <eos> And I feel all this pain <eos> Stuffed it down, it's back again <eos> And I lie here in bed <eos> All alone, I can't mend <eos> But I feel tomorrow will be okay <eos> But I'm on the outside, I'm looking in <eos> I can see through you, see your true colors <eos> 'Cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me <eos> I can see through you, see to the real you <eos> 
Your love is rain my heart the flower <eos> I need your drink or I will die <eos> My very life is in your power <eos> Will I wither and fade or blossom to the sky <eos> Água de beber <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> Água de beber <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> Água de beber <eos> (Água de beber, Água de beber) <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> Água de beber <eos> (Água de beber, Água de beber) <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> Água de beber <eos> (Água de beber, Água de beber) <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> Água de beber <eos> (Água de beber, Água de beber) <eos> Água de beber camará <eos> 
Lights go down, wheels go 'round <eos> I'm taking you home <eos> Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now <eos> I'm not ready to shut it down <eos> The way the dashboard glow <eos> Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind <eos> And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot <eos> Stop this car and throw it in park and just <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> (Slow dance in a parking lot) <eos> A half song gone, one door open, across the lot <eos> A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car <eos> Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time <eos> To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks <eos> You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman" <eos> And I don't care what song comes next <eos> I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> And get close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just <eos> A slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> 
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack frost nipping at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that santa's on his way - <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so i'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to ninety-two <eos> Although its been said many times <eos> Many ways: "merry christmas to you" <eos> 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Let your heart be light <eos> Next year all our troubles will be out of sight <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Make the Yuletide gay <eos> Next year all our troubles will be miles away <eos> Once again as in olden days <eos> Happy golden days of yore <eos> Faithful friends who were near to us <eos> Will be dear to us once more <eos> Through the years we all will be together <eos> If the fates allow <eos> Hang a shining star upon the highest bough <eos> And have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas, now <eos>

When the black man's word <eos> Was spoken, yeah <eos> And the white men thought <eos> It was a token, oh yeah <eos> We have suffered our whole life,  <eos> Doing things that you're not supposed to do, yeah <eos> We were beat until our back was black and blue <eos> Ahhh, I was born a loser <eos> Ahhh ahhh, I was born a loser <eos> Because I'm a black man <eos> I was living in my owner land <eos> I was moved because of white man's plan <eos> I am living in a different lair <eos> We don't want no war <eos> , oh no <eos> All we need is pay <eos> And some trust, ooh <eos> We were beaten our whole life,  <eos> Doing things that you're not supposed to do, yeah <eos> We were beat until our back was black and blue <eos> Ahhh, I was born a loser <eos> Ahhh ahhh, I was born a loser <eos> Because I'm a black man <eos> I was moved from my owner land <eos> Just because of all those white man's plan <eos> I am living in a white man's lair <eos>

You said that I drank too much <eos> The tattoos on my skin are not your style <eos> You didn't like cigarettes on my kiss <eos> Well I hope that's something you miss <eos> Cause I'm not slowing down for awhile <eos> I've been desperate to fix what we've been <eos> Somethings need to stay broken <eos> Realize you're not worth me trying to hide <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> Want you so bad that I couldn't see <eos> The truth was sitting there in front of me <eos> It's never love, it was never real <eos> You wanted something to fix not something to feel <eos> But I am not your accessory <eos> I am not a Marie Annette for your passenger seat <eos> A lesson learned and now I'm free <eos> Well your green eyes look like shit to me <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> So won't you go on and marry that lady <eos> Wears Louis Vuitton, drives around in her Mercedes <eos> Says, "Downtown Dallas is the place to be" <eos> Daddy gave her everything that she's got for free <eos> She looks real good with her head down low <eos> Always minds her business in your shadow <eos> Kisses your ass like you wanted me to <eos> Well good luck honey he's all for you <eos> Cause baby you don't own me <eos> You never could control me <eos> The road you're on looks lonely <eos> And I hope like hell it is <eos> Cause I'm never gonna be <eos> Your southern Texas wanna be beauty queen <eos> And I'm never gonna be <eos> Your red dress, long leg, blonde hair southern dream <eos> I know I'm more than just the pretty things <eos> And that's alright by me <eos> 
I know you're somewhere out there <eos> Somewhere far away <eos> I want you back, I want you back <eos> My neighbors think I'm crazy <eos> But they don't understand <eos> You're all I had, you're all I had <eos> At night when the stars light up my room <eos> I sit by myself <eos> Talking to the moon <eos> Tryna get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town <eos> They say I've gone mad <eos> Yeah, I've gone mad <eos> But they don't know what I know <eos> 'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back <eos> Yeah, they're talking back, oh <eos> At night when the stars light up my room <eos> I sit by myself <eos> Talking to the moon <eos> Tryna get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> Do you ever hear me calling? <eos> Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh <eos> 'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon <eos> Still trying to get to you <eos> In hopes you're on the other side talking to me, too <eos> Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon? <eos> Oh-oh <eos> I know you're somewhere out there <eos> Somewhere far away <eos>

Well, I heard you crying loud <eos> All the way across town <eos> You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl <eos> As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself <eos> Well, don't get lonely now <eos> And dry your whining eyes <eos> I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get <eos> So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> Oh, I heard it all before <eos> So don't knock down my door <eos> I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser <eos> To try and slag me down because I know you're right <eos> So go do what you like <eos> Make sure you do it wise <eos> You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there <eos> You can't go forcing something if it's just not right <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> No time to search the world around <eos> 'Cause you know where I'll be found <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos> When I come around <eos> 
Señor tigre, déjeme pasar por su vereda <eos> Le prometo que mis rayas son inciertas <eos> Maquillaje regional dejando huella <eos> En la oscuridad de la selva tropical <eos> En la jungla, tu pelaje viste de color de hierba <eos> Entre lianas que descansan en la tierra <eos> Tu reinado se respeta en la arboleda <eos> En la oscuridad de la selva tropical <eos> Señor tigre, que dolor aqueja su existir felino <eos> No hay humano que no tiеmble como niño <eos> Al pisar, su reino humedеcido <eos> De la oscuridad de la selva tropical <eos>

No existe amor perfecto <eos> Y empiezo a pensar que esto del amor es una fantasía <eos> Y no me la creo, que tú ya no te acuerdes <eos> De todas las veces que te hice mía <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Tе hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchastе cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de rogarte <eos> Y todavía me exiges <eos> Que olvide tu sonrisa y borre de mi mente todas tus caricias <eos> Me subes hasta el cielo y luego caigo al suelo <eos> Porque tú te vas cuando más te quería <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> ¿Por qué no te marchaste cuando aún no eras tan indispensable? <eos> Me pides que te olvide cuando hiciste todo para enamorarme <eos> ¿A qué estabas jugando? <eos> Dime por qué diablos me obligaste amarte y luego te alejaste <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> No creo que merezca que mi corazón tires a la basura <eos> Me suena tan ilógico que ahora digas que no fue tu culpa <eos> Si no te interesaba <eos> ¿Pa' qué me besabas con tanta dulzura y con tanta ternura? <eos> Te hubieras ido antes <eos> Y así ya no tendría estas ganas de <eos> De rogarte <eos>

Looking in your eyes <eos> I see a memory <eos> Of how it used to be <eos> Before our world came tumbling down <eos> I try <eos> I did nothing else <eos> But try to keep our love alive <eos> Oh, how I loved you so <eos> And you just made me cry <eos> Did you deceive me? <eos> Did you do me wrong? <eos> Boy, I can`t take it <eos> Can`t take it anymore <eos> I feel so helpless <eos> Not knowing what to do <eos> Do I keep on crying? <eos> Or do I leave you? <eos> Boy, I`ve been told <eos> Leaving you is the thing to do <eos> It would be easy <eos> If I didn`t want to start anew <eos> Boy, I`ve been told <eos> Leaving you is the thing to do <eos> It won`t be easy <eos> Cause breaking up is hard to do <eos> Touch this lonely heart <eos> As I try to say to you <eos> About the things you do <eos> Now I`m alone <eos> Dissatisfied <eos> Did you deceive me? <eos> Did you do me wrong? <eos> Boy, I can`t take it <eos> Can`t take it anymore <eos> I feel so helpless <eos> Not knowing what to do <eos> Do I keep on crying? <eos> Or do I leave you? <eos> Just like my friend said <eos> You were never good for me <eos> So just go about your way <eos> Don`t worry about me <eos> And just forget we ever happened <eos> The time has come to say goodbye <eos> Don`t ask why <eos> Just let it all go <eos> I`ve made it through <eos> There`s someone new <eos> 
I wanna hold the hand inside you <eos> I wanna take the breath that's true <eos> I look to you and I see nothing <eos> I look to you to see the truth <eos> You live your life, you go in shadows <eos> You'll come apart and you'll go blind <eos> Some kind of light into your darkness <eos> Colors your eyes with what's not there <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos> A stranger's light comes on slowly <eos> A stranger's heart without a home <eos> You put your hands into your head <eos> A million smiles cover your heart <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> Strange you never knew <eos> Fade into you <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos> I think it's strange you never knew <eos>

Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Let your heart be light <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be out of sight <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Make the Yuletide gay <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be miles away <eos> Once again as in olden days <eos> Happy golden days of yore <eos> Faithful friends who are dear to us <eos> Will be near to us once more <eos> Someday soon we all will be together <eos> If the fates allow <eos> Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow <eos> So have yourself a merry little Christmas now <eos> 
So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And never brought to mind? <eos> Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And days auld lang syne? <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll drink a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> Where we, too, have run about the braes <eos> And pulled the gowans fine <eos> But we've wandered many a weary foot <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We, too, have pedaled in the burn <eos> From morning sun 'till dine <eos> But seas between us braid have roared <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> And there's a hand, my trusty fiere <eos> And he's a hand o' thine <eos> And we'll take a right gude-willy waught <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang- one more time! <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For <eos> (Auld lang) <eos> Lang syne <eos>

La, la, la, la, la <eos> La, la, la, la, la <eos> I wrote her off for the tenth time today <eos> And practiced all the things I would say <eos> But she came over, I lost my nerve <eos> I took her back and made her dessert <eos> Now I know I'm being used <eos> That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse <eos> I know she's playing with me <eos> That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> We make plans to go out at night <eos> I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light <eos> This rejection's got me so low <eos> If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Now I'll relate this little bit <eos> It happens more than I'd like to admit <eos> Late at night, she knocks on my door <eos> She's drunk again and looking to score <eos> Now I know I should say no <eos> But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go <eos> I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb <eos> I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem <eos> Oh hey yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> Oh yeah yeah <eos> When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me <eos> Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends <eos> When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease <eos> Then I wonder how much more I can spend <eos> Well, I guess I should stick up for myself <eos> But I really think it's better this way <eos> The more you suffer <eos> The more it shows you really care <eos> Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos>

Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know I'm just a flight away <eos> If you want it, you could take a private plane <eos> A kilómetros estamos conectando <eos> Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando <eos> You know I got a lot to say <eos> All these voices in the background of my brain <eos> Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando <eos> Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know that I can see right through you <eos> I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> What you wanna do? <eos> It's written all over your face, times two <eos> 'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> I can hear your thoughts like a melody <eos> Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep <eos> You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe <eos> (On repeat) <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> (You know I got a lot to say) <eos> (All these voices in the background of my brain) <eos>

Forever <eos> Don't seem so far away <eos> 'till you get there <eos> This is the best part of me <eos> And it ain't fair <eos> The silhoutte (the silhoutte baby) still got a hold on me <eos> The second thing still smells smoke on me <eos> And I hate it but I love it, so <eos> It's probably why I can't let it go <eos> I swear she wants my soul <eos> Keep me goin' back and forth <eos> Back and forth <eos> Swingin' <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> Back and forth <eos> Between loving and running <eos> Back and forth <eos> Between something and nothing <eos> For you <eos> I'll keep swinging baby <eos> All you <eos> We don't ever say it's over <eos> We just make our way back to love <eos> We don't ever say it's over <eos> I could be stressin' <eos> I could be trippin' <eos> I could be losing my mind <eos> But I'm still pressin' <eos> And you still checkin' to see if a nigga been lyin' <eos> Such a waste of time <eos> But don't you waste that  <eos> Said you don't wanna feel <eos> I don't wanna feel either <eos> You say you need to learn me better <eos> Let me be your teacher <eos> Don't hold your breath when you're tryna breathe <eos> 'Cause that's enough to make a nigga deep <eos> And keep on swingin' <eos> Alright, alright <eos> Alright, alright <eos> Keep on swingin' <eos> We don't ever say it's over <eos> We just make our way back to us <eos> We don't ever say it's over <eos> We just make our way back to our love <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> And you keep me swingin' baby <eos> Back and forth <eos> Between loving and running <eos> Back and forth <eos> Between something and nothing <eos> For you <eos> I'll keep swinging baby <eos> All you <eos> 
I got good at holdin' back, never gettin' too attached <eos> I got good at knowin' that I'd be alone on Frdiday <eos> I got good at tellin' me my Romeo was make-believe <eos> He's gotta be 'cause, honestly, why else would I be lonely? <eos> Who wants to keep on pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> Yeah, just to let somebody break it more <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> You said I got it all wrong, you could turn my heart back on <eos> And that you'll always love me like that classic Dolly Parton song <eos> You had no problem pickin' pieces up off the floor <eos> I can't believe what I believed before <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did <eos> Nobody's kissed me in the pourin' rain <eos> No one could ever get this stubborn girl to change <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> You did <eos> Now I turn up every love song <eos> And I'm the first one to admit <eos> Never thought I'd wanna say "I do" <eos> Just look at what you did <eos> I didn't think my heart could love again <eos> I swore I'd fall out if I ever fell back in <eos> Didn't believe in for worse or better <eos> That someone could want me forever <eos> But you did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> You did (You did, you did, you did) <eos> I'm the furthest thing from perfect <eos> Didn't think that I was worth it <eos> But you did <eos> 
Miren como nos hablan de libertad <eos> Cuando de ella nos privan en realidad <eos> Miren como pregonan tranquilidad <eos> Cuando nos atormenta la autoridad <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Miren como nos hablan del paraíso <eos> Cuando nos llueven penas como granizo <eos> Miren el entusiasmo con la sentencia <eos> Sabiendo que mataban a la inocencia <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> El que oficia la muerte como un verdugo <eos> Tranquilo esta tomando su desayuno <eos> Con esto se pusieron la soga al cuello <eos> El quinto mandamiento no tiene sello <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos> Mientras más injusticias, señor Fiscal <eos> Más fuerza tiene mi alma para cantar <eos> Lindo segar el trigo en el sembrao <eos> Regado con tu sangre Julián Grimau <eos> Qué dirá el Santo Padre <eos> Que vive en Roma <eos> Que le están degollando <eos> A su paloma <eos>

I'm in, I'm in too deep <eos> Can't keep my head above water <eos> It's hard to breathe <eos> Drownin', fallin' beneath <eos> I think I need a minute <eos> Or I'll run out of speed <eos> Every night, I'm searchin' for something new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour, ah <eos> It's happy hour <eos> It's happy hour <eos> Hold me, hold me tonight <eos> It's the last thing I remember <eos> It's slowly dyin' <eos> You make me feel alive <eos> Every second spent togеther <eos> Was satisfyin' <eos> Every night, I'm searchin' for somеthing new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> Searchin' for something new <eos> How am I gonna get through? <eos> Every face reminds me of you, ah, ah <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour, ah <eos> It's happy hour <eos> It's happy hour <eos> We waste our nights <eos> From light to dark sides <eos> Like every hour is happy hour <eos> We're lost, not found <eos> We're all crashin' down <eos> When every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos> Every hour is happy hour <eos> 
Ô la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Hum la belle vie <eos> On est seul <eos> On est libre <eos> Et l'on s'aime <eos> On s'amuse à passer avec tous ses copains <eos> Des nuits blanches <eos> Qui se penchent <eos> Sur les petits matins <eos> Mais la belle vie <eos> Sans amour <eos> Sans soucis <eos> Sans problème <eos> Oui la belle vie <eos> On s'enlace <eos> On est triste <eos> Et l'on traîne <eos> Alors pense que moi je t'aime <eos> Et quand tu auras compris <eos> Réveille-toi <eos> Je serai là <eos> Pour toi <eos> 
Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But the fire is so delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought some corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> When we finally kiss good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you really hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear <eos> We're still goodbying <eos> As long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> He doesn't care if it's in below <eos> He's sitting <eos> By the fires glossy glow <eos> He don't care about the cold <eos> And the winds that blow <eos> He just says, let it snow <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> Ooh, wee, goes the storm <eos> Why should he worry <eos> When he's nice and warm? <eos> His girl by his side <eos> And the lights turned low <eos> He just says <eos> Let it snow, let it snow <eos> I don't care <eos> Oh, the weather outside is frightful <eos> But that fire is, mmm, delightful <eos> Since we've no place to go <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> It doesn't show signs of stopping <eos> And I've brought lots of corn for popping <eos> The lights are turned way down low <eos> So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> Let it snow <eos> When we finally say good night <eos> How I'll hate going out in the storm <eos> But if you'll only hold me tight <eos> All the way home I'll be warm <eos> Fire is slowly dying <eos> And, my dear, we're still goodbying <eos> Long as you love me so <eos> Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow <eos> 
A clean up woman is a woman who <eos> Gets all the love we girls leave behind <eos> The reason I know so much about her <eos> Is because she picked up a man of mine <eos> Jumpin' slick was my ruin <eos> 'Cause, I found out all I was doin' <eos> Was making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, oh yeah <eos> Just making it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my baby's love, uh-huh, mhm <eos> I took this man's love and put it on a shelf <eos> And like a fool I thought I had him all to myself <eos> When you needed love I was out having fun <eos> But I found out that all I had done <eos> Was made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To get my man's love, uh-huh <eos> Yeah, that's what I did, I made it easy for the clean up woman <eos> To steal my baby's love, oh yeah <eos> The clean up woman will wipe his blues away <eos> She'll give him plenty lovin' 24 hours a day <eos> The clean up woman, she'll sweep him off his feet <eos> She's the one who'll take him in when you dump him in the street <eos> So take a tip, you better get hip <eos> To the clean up woman 'cause she's tough <eos> I mean, she really cleans up <eos>

Some kids have and some don't <eos> And some of us are wondering why <eos> Mom won't watch the news at night <eos> There's too much stuff that's making her cry <eos> We need some help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> A house, a yard <eos> A neighbourhood <eos> Where you can ride your new bike to school <eos> A kind of world where Mom and Dad <eos> Still believe in the golden rule <eos> Life's not that simple <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice, one simple word <eos> Hearts know what to say <eos> One dream can change the world <eos> Keep believing <eos> Till you find a way <eos> Yesterday, while walking home <eos> I saw a kid on Newberry Road <eos> He pulled a pistol from his bag <eos> And tossed it in the river below <eos> Thanks for the help <eos> Down here on earth <eos> A thousand prayers, a million words <eos> But one voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> One voice was heard <eos> 
Go on and wring my neck <eos> Like when a rag gets wet <eos> A little discipline <eos> For my pet genius <eos> My head is like lettuce <eos> Go on, dig your thumbs in <eos> I cannot stop givin' <eos> I'm thirty-something <eos> Sense of security <eos> Like pockets jingling <eos> Midlife crisis <eos> Suck ingenuity <eos> Down, through the family tree <eos> You're perfect yes, it's true <eos> But without me, you're only you (You're only you) <eos> Your menstruating heart <eos> It ain't bleeding enough for two <eos> It's a midlife crisis <eos> It's a midlife crisis <eos> What an inheritance <eos> The salt and the kleenex <eos> Morbid self attention <eos> Bending my pinky back <eos> A little discipline <eos> A donor by habit <eos> A little discipline <eos> Rent an opinion <eos> Sense of security <eos> Holding blunt instrument <eos> Midlife crisis <eos> I'm a perfectionist <eos> And perfect is a skinned knee <eos> It's a midlife crisis <eos> It's a midlife crisis <eos>

This town was built on miles of hope <eos> And I dare you to give me one reason to stay <eos> And maybe I won't go away <eos> So far you've only dared me once <eos> And I think we know that's not even close enough <eos> Not enough for me to stay <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Well I'm getting tired of standing around <eos> Just sitting here and waiting to be found <eos> Same old shit just a different day <eos> Well I'll wait around for one more day <eos> But I know that's what I will always say <eos> Will this ever be O.K.? <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> 
Intro <eos> Oye, soy yo... <eos> Tu cuquito otra vez... <eos> Uufff.. <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Resistiré, yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré <eos> Te dije que yo sigo acabando... <eos> 'Si hombre <eos> Resisteré <eos> Cuando pierda todas las partidas <eos> Cuando duerma con la soledad <eos> Cuando se me cierren las salidas <eos> Why la noche no me deje en paz <eos> Cuando tenga miedo del silencio <eos> Cuando cueste mantenerse en pie <eos> Cuando se revelen los recuerdos <eos> Why me ponga contra la pared <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Me volveré de hierro para endurecer la piel <eos> Why aunque los vientos de la vida soplen fuerte <eos> Soy como el junco que se dobla pero siempre sigue en pie <eos> Resistiré <eos> Para seguir viviendo <eos> Recogeré los mares why jamás me venceré <eos> Why aunque los sueños se me rompan en pedazos <eos> Yo resistiré, resistiré <eos> Yo resistiré <eos> Resistiré brother <eos> Resistiré etc etc.... <eos>

The cycle repeated <eos> As explosions broke in the sky <eos> All that I needed <eos> Was the one thing I couldn't find <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> The colors conflicted <eos> As the flames climbed into the clouds <eos> I wanted to fix this <eos> But couldn't stop from tearing it down <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Caught in the burning glow <eos> And I was there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let you know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> You told me yes, you held me high <eos> And I believed when you told that lie <eos> I played soldier, you played king <eos> And struck me down when I kissed that ring <eos> You lost that right to hold that crown <eos> I built you up but you let me down <eos> So when you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> And you were there at the turn <eos> Waiting to let me know <eos> We're building it up to break it back down <eos> We're building it up to burn it down <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> When you fall, I'll take my turn <eos> And fan the flames as your blazes burn <eos> We can't wait to burn it to the ground <eos> 
I've spent way too much time moving on <eos> Tried a couple of therapists <eos> Even got rid of some stuff <eos> It's like my mind got a mind of its own <eos> 'Cause I've been busy getting over <eos> Getting over someone <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like my skin isn't longing <eos> After the weight of your touch <eos> It's what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Someone left me with a broken heart <eos> That I passed on to someone <eos> And broke a new one apart <eos> Things can be good enough <eos> Still not enough <eos> And that's why I'm terrified <eos> Having you by my side <eos> It's not like my brain's not rushing <eos> Every time you get too close <eos> It's not like I can't imagine <eos> Losing myself in your arms <eos> It's not like it ain't a habit <eos> Thinking 'bout "what if" too much <eos> Like what if I mess this up? <eos> So just take it slow <eos> 'Cause I'm scared to let go <eos> And my heart is struggling <eos> Not to get hurt again <eos> Just take it slow <eos> Mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> 
Preparé el café como siempre <eos> El mismo desayuno de los viernes <eos> Y no estabas, tú no estabas <eos> Sé que prometí ser paciente <eos> ¿Pero qué le hago si me duele? <eos> La distancia nos tiene en pausa <eos> Solo sé bailar si tú bailas conmigo <eos> Todo está tan mal si yo no estoy contigo, contigo <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> De amor de amor <eos> Porque yo te extraño desde la' 9 a las 5 <eos> Yo te extraño viernes, sábado y domingo <eos> Dime cuándo llega' (Dime cuándo llega') <eos> Pa' recogerte con cartel y con globito (Hmm-mm) <eos> Yo ya no quiero dormir solito <eos> ¿De qué me sirven los 5 sentidos si no te tengo conmigo? <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (Avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor (Me muero de amor) <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Ah-ah-ah-ah) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor <eos> Me pregunto cuánto falta <eos> Entiende cuánto me haces falta <eos> Ya no quiero la distancia <eos> Ya devuélveme la calma <eos> Un, dos, tres de la mañana <eos> Y la cama que te extraña <eos> Me pregunta cuánto falta <eos> Para ver tu cara <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? <eos> Toma el primer avión (El primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy <eos> Muriéndome de amor <eos> ¿Por qué no vuelves hoy? (¿Por qué no vuelves, no vuelves hoy?) <eos> Toma el primer avión (Toma el primer, el primer avión) <eos> No sabes cómo estoy (Que yo te extraño) <eos> Muriéndome de amor, de amor (Me estoy muriendo lento, lento, lento) <eos> To' los días que no puedo vivir sin ti (Ay, lento, lento, lento) <eos> Me haces falta (Tanta falta) <eos> Ay, móntante en el avión y ven <eos> 
Remember when we said goodbye <eos> I wiped my tears <eos> You didn't cry <eos> We both said things we didn't mean <eos> Reaching for the hope <eos> But caught between the screams <eos> And I would try to calm you down <eos> But you wouldn't listen <eos> And now I find you're not around <eos> And it's your love I'm missing <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't make things better <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't stay together <eos> If we could both go back in time <eos> Back to the days when you were mine <eos> We'd vow to try <eos> But who's to say that the love we shared <eos> Could ever be the same <eos> Maybe someday <eos> We'll both learn just how fragile love is <eos> The mind forgets <eos> But the heart still burns <eos> As it longs for your kiss <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't make things better <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't stay together <eos> Through the things that we said <eos> And the tears that we shed <eos> Love stayed <eos> (We never let it fade) <eos> But the words went to far <eos> We're both left with the scars of love <eos> Now we must go our separate ways, my love <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't make things better <eos> Louder than love <eos> (Louder than love) <eos> That's what we were, we were <eos> Louder than love <eos> And we couldn't stay together <eos>

I can't wait to get to school each day <eos> And wait for you to pass my way <eos> And bells start to ring <eos> And angels start to sing <eos> "Hey that's the girl for you <eos> So what are ya gonna do?" <eos> Hey little girl <eos> I love you (I love you so) <eos> All I do is think of you <eos> Day and night (day and night that's all i do) <eos> I can't get you off my mind <eos> Thinking back (all the time) <eos> All the time <eos> I begin to take the long way home <eos> Just so I can be alone <eos> To think of how to say <eos> My heart's here to stay <eos> (Hey I'm in love with you <eos> I think the world of you) <eos> So won't you please, please be mine? <eos> (oh please be mine mine mine) <eos> All I do is think of you (baby) <eos> Day and night (day and night that's all i do) <eos> I can't get you off my mind <eos> Thinking about (Thinking about you all the time) <eos> All the time <eos> Oooooooh (bub bub ba bub bu daaaa...ooooooooooh) <eos> Girl, I wanna say thing but I don't wanna tell ya <eos> (i just think about it and I'm in love with you) <eos> (bup bup bu da daaaaaa....oooooh) <eos> I think the world of you (ooooooh) <eos> Ooooooooooooh <eos> All I do is think of you <eos> Day and night (day and night)(night and day) night and day yeah yeah <eos> I can get you off my mind (oooooh) <eos> Thinking about <eos> Oooooooooh.....oooooooooooh baby <eos> I keep thinking about you <eos> All night long <eos> Oooooooooh <eos> Baby <eos> Day and night that's all I do <eos> Woooooaaaah (heeeeeeeey) <eos> I can't get you (heeeeey) <eos> I can't get you off my mind (heeeeey) <eos> Hoooooooooo (heeeeeey)(heeeeeeeeey) <eos> Ooooooh! <eos> All I do is think of you <eos> Day and night (Day and night that's all I do) <eos> I can't get you off my mind <eos> Thinking about (I should be thinking about you) <eos> 'Cause you know <eos> Sometimes <eos> All I do is think of you <eos> Day and night <eos> I can't get you off my mind <eos> Thinking about (Day and night that's all I do) <eos> 'Cause you know sometimes girl, (I should be thinking about you) <eos> I said sometimes <eos> I get so worried about the little somethings (Day and night that's all I do) <eos> 
Dreams, that's where I have to go <eos> To see your beautiful face anymore <eos> I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio <eos> Hope, hope there's a conversation <eos> We both admit, we had it good <eos> But until then it's alienation, I know <eos> That much is understood <eos> And I realise <eos> If you asked me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> (Not over you) <eos> Damn, damn girl, you do it well <eos> And I thought you were innocent <eos> You took this heart and put it through hell <eos> But still you're magnificent <eos> And I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me <eos> I turn around and I'm back in the game <eos> Even better than the old me <eos> But I'm not even close without you <eos> If you ask me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> And if I had the chance to renew <eos> You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do <eos> I could get back on the right track <eos> But only if you'd be convinced <eos> So until then <eos> If you ask me how I'm doing <eos> I would say I'm doing just fine <eos> I would lie and say that you're not on my mind <eos> But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two <eos> And finally, I'm forced to face the truth <eos> No matter what I say, I'm not over you <eos> Not over you, not over you, not over you <eos>

Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Enfrentarlo y no puedo, no puedo <eos> En el viaje perdí mi verdad <eos> Siendo una estrella dejé de brillar <eos> Mil voces comenzaron hablar (Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla) <eos> Mi subconsciente comenzó atacar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Cada noche el silencio es un mar (Un mar) <eos> En él me ahoga una tempestad <eos> Camino y corro para borrar (Para borrar, para borrar) <eos> Y en mi locura todo cuestionar <eos> Muy dentro me quiero rendir (Rendir) <eos> Mi mente en el juego contra mí (Contra mí) <eos> Tiembla toda fe que hay en mí (En mí) <eos> Un ruido interminable grita en mí (Grita en mí) <eos> Quiero hablar y no puedo <eos> Respirar y no puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y no puedo <eos> Quiero estar y no puedo <eos> Escuchar y no puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme y no puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> En la tormenta que habita en mí <eos> El sol brilla fuerte y lo puedo sentir <eos> Puede envolverme alma y mente <eos> Sentir que puedo seguir <eos> Quiero hablar y yo puedo <eos> Respirar y yo puedo <eos> Caminar, olvidar, enfrentarlo y yo puedo <eos> Quiero estar, y yo puedo <eos> Escuchar y yo puedo <eos> Regresar, descifrar, ya sanarme, yo puedo <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad (Me dije) <eos> Mi ansiedad <eos> 
You broke me first <eos> Maybe you don't like talking too much about yourself <eos> But you shoulda told me <eos> That you were thinking 'bout someone else <eos> You're drunk at a party <eos> Or maybe it's just that your car broke down <eos> Your phone's been off for a couple of months <eos> So you're calling me now <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> Took a while, was in denial when I first heard <eos> That you moved on quicker than I could've ever <eos> You know that hurt <eos> Swear, for a while, I would stare at my phone <eos> Just to see your name <eos> But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say <eos> I know you, you're like this <eos> When shit don't go your way you needed me to fix it <eos> And like me, I did <eos> But I ran out of every reason <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> I'll never let you have it <eos> What did you think would happen? <eos> Now suddenly you're asking for it back <eos> Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve? <eos> Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had <eos> But I don't really care how bad it hurts <eos> When you broke me first <eos> You broke me first (You broke me first) <eos> You broke me first, ooh oh <eos> 
All the silhouettes of passers-by <eos> The sound of streets and familiar cries <eos> Will vanish into the illusion <eos> No serenity and never compromise <eos> There’s no dignity as you fraternize <eos> With your delusions, so set me free <eos> Take all you need and I'll be waiting <eos> Together we’re jaded <eos> And now with enervated <eos> Wings ablaze I'm burning <eos> The wreckage of my life <eos> I nosedive to the furnace <eos> Set fire to the stars at night <eos> They got me this far <eos> The judgement now begins <eos> I'm bleeding from the inside <eos> Vanishing into thin air <eos> My body hits the floor <eos> Much slower than before <eos> Crisis, man overboard <eos> Emergency abort <eos> I watch them dancing <eos> All the fireflies of war gather <eos> All the damage that’s been done, paid for <eos> Won’t you reveal yourself to me? <eos> As I rise above the deep <eos> Won’t you reveal yourself to me? <eos> Ooh <eos> All the fireflies above gather <eos> All the damage that’s been done, paid for <eos> Now won’t you save yourself for me? <eos> Won’t you save yourself for me? <eos> Oh <eos> 
I pick you up and we ride <eos> To the end of the earth <eos> We can give it a try <eos> But it'll never work <eos> Oh no, I lied <eos> Oh no, you cried <eos> Oh no, you lied <eos> Oh no, I tried <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> Well, I hate myself <eos> And I hate the earth <eos> We could give it a try <eos> For whatever it's worth <eos> Oh no, I lied <eos> Oh no, you cried <eos> Oh no, you lied <eos> Oh no, I tried <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> Badillac <eos> 
Baby, I see them boys <eos> They always lookin' at you <eos> But I ain’t causin' a scene <eos> 'Cause girl, I’m the one that's with you <eos> They can shoot you a wink, they can buy you a drink <eos> Try to steal your attention <eos> They can talk a big talk, they can walk a big walk <eos> But I know you ain't going home with 'em <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> I know how you like your coffee <eos> And how hot you like your bath <eos> I know what makes you angry <eos> And what makes you laugh <eos> I know the taste of your lips, every inch of your skin <eos> The little things that turn you on <eos> I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine <eos> Saying baby, take me home <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> I'ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> I’m gonna love you, love you <eos> The only way that I know <eos> I’m gonna love you, love you <eos> Like there's no tomorrow <eos> Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do (Like I do) <eos> I’ma love you 'til the good Lord comes back for me and you <eos> Girl, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I do <eos> Yeah, nobody, nobody, nobody gonna love you like I <eos>

In the bleak midwinter, frost winds made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow <eos> In the bleak midwinter, long ago <eos> Angels and archangels may have gathered there <eos> Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air <eos> But his mother only, in her maiden bliss <eos> Worshiped the beloved with a kiss <eos> Hm <eos> Oh, what can I give him, poor as I am? <eos> If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb <eos> If I were a wise man, I would do my part <eos> Yet what I can I give him <eos> I will give my heart <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> In the bleak midwinter, frost wind made moan <eos> Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone <eos> 
You don't need to pretend, know you don't want to be friends with me <eos> Don't get defensive, I don't mean to offend, baby <eos> I'm all you want, all you need, so I guess it depends <eos> Don't make me ask you again, again <eos> Plant rosebuds on my cheek, I'll blush like rosé wine <eos> And if you water them enough, I promise we'll be fine <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yеah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> Straight out of the '90s, definition of brown sugar <eos> Hand on your thigh whеn I am driving downtown with you <eos> Everything's right, soon as those bedroom lights get dimmer, dimmer, oh <eos> You are like blood in my veins, you'll never be enough <eos> Approach me and pour a bit of your love <eos> In my cup <eos> And in LA, people don't dance at parties, baby <eos> But in London, we tear it up, so maybe <eos> You can go crazy, you can go crazy, yeah <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> You can have anything you want (Anything you want) <eos> Anything from you want from me is yours <eos> 'Cause I'm crazy (Crazy), yeah, I'm crazy for you (Crazy) <eos> Approach me, baby (Ah), I'm crazy for you, crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy (Crazy, crazy) <eos> You can go, go (Crazy, crazy, crazy) crazy, yeah (Oh, na, na, na) <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go, go crazy <eos> You can go, go (Oh) <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da, la-da <eos> La-da <eos>

When I'm alone <eos> I talk to myself <eos> Like I'm talking to you <eos> Talking to you <eos> I lie on the couch <eos> And hum a little tune <eos> Hmm-mm <eos> I'm singing to you <eos> And I know it'll take a little more time to get through <eos> 'Cause I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> You know I can't control it <eos> I'm acting like such a fool <eos> And I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> Here still wishing and hoping and waiting to hear it from you <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> If I fall asleep <eos> And find you in a dream <eos> Lying next to me <eos> Next to me <eos> I'm holding my breath <eos> We're tangled in sheets <eos> And I wanna believe <eos> I wanna believe <eos> But in the morning I'm still waiting for this dream <eos> To come true <eos> 'Cause I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> You know I can't control it <eos> I'm acting like such a fool <eos> And I'm so, I'm so in love with you <eos> Here still wishing and hoping and waiting to hear it from you <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> Let me hear it from you <eos> You <eos> 
Yo te di todo mi amor y más <eos> Y tu no reconoces ni lo que es amar <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Yo se que un día tu volverás <eos> Y tu de todo te arrepentirás <eos> Yo me puse dispuesta a tus pies <eos> Y tan solo con desprecio me has pagado pero ahora ve <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba, hoy me arrepiento <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba <eos> No se lo que pensé, estaba loca <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba y que por ti la vida daba <eos> Si una vez dije que te amaba no lo vuelvo a hacer <eos> Ese error es cosa de ayer <eos> 
I'm leaving this town tomorrow <eos> I got many places to see <eos> And many places to go <eos> I'm so tired of doing the same old thing <eos> Shooting for the highest star <eos> Want people to remember my name <eos> If you don't understand <eos> Let me break it down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> I have friends and family that I see everyday <eos> Don't plan on moving forward <eos> Stuck in the same old place <eos> But that's not the road that I wanna go down <eos> I gotta do what's best for me <eos> Ain't no hanging around <eos> I could stay here forever <eos> But I just can't stick around <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> When the rooster crows I'm leaving <eos> And I ain't looking back <eos> All you gonna see is taillights <eos> Crossing those railroad tracks <eos> If I don't leave I'll die here <eos> And end up six feet down <eos> I know that there's life <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos> Outside of this town <eos>

You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen <eos> Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen., <eos> But do you recall? <eos> The most famous reindeer of all? <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> Had a very shiny nose <eos> And if you ever saw it <eos> You would even say it glows <eos> All of the other reindeer <eos> Used to laugh and call him names; <eos> They never let poor Rudolph <eos> Join in any reindeer games <eos> Then one foggy Christmas Eve <eos> Santa came to say <eos> Rudolph with your nose so bright <eos> Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? <eos> Then how the reindeer loved him <eos> As they shouted out with glee <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> You'll go down in history <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> Had a very shiny nose <eos> And if you ever saw it <eos> You would even say it glows <eos> All of the other reindeer <eos> Used to laugh and call him names; <eos> They never let poor Rudolph <eos> Join in any reindeer games <eos> Then one foggy Christmas Eve <eos> Santa came to say <eos> Rudolph with your nose so bright <eos> Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? <eos> Then how the reindeer loved him <eos> As they shouted out with glee <eos> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer <eos> You'll go down in history <eos>

Where has it gone, that fire <eos> That from the darkn ess kept us <eos> Where all the righteous souls <eos> With flames in their eyes <eos> Yet in the end <eos> The gilded tongues <eos> Yes, in the end <eos> They burrowed in spines <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Step forward, lost seeker <eos> Read the signs of silence <eos> Come close, turn the last stone <eos> Truth lies in violence <eos> See the limbs of chilling mist <eos> Creeping these desolate halls <eos> Searching, it seems for solace <eos> For some haven <eos> From this terrible cold <eos> Yet in the end, the gilded tongues <eos> They were serpentine <eos> Yes, in the end, the gilded ones <eos> They were serpentine <eos>

If I can't let you go will darkness divide? <eos> For the fiction of love is the truth of our lies <eos> We were playing for keeps but we both knew the cost <eos> Now the only way out’s in your heart shaped box <eos> But I hate that it seemed you were never enough <eos> We were broken and bleeding but never gave up <eos> And I hate that I made you the enemy <eos> And I hate that your heart was the casualty <eos> Now I hate that I need you <eos> As we rest here alone like notes on a page <eos> The finest to compose could not play our pain <eos> With a candle through time I could still see your ghost <eos> But I can't close my eyes, for it <eos> For it is there where you haunt me most (Haunt me most) <eos> Where you haunt me most <eos> I hate that it seemed you were never enough <eos> We were broken and bleeding but never gave up <eos> And I hope that I sing through your memory <eos> As we echo through time in the melody <eos> Now I hate that I need you <eos> And I hear you now when you said it hurt <eos> But it had to fall, fall apart to work <eos> As I see you now in what's left of me <eos> Is it too late to plead insanity? <eos> I won’t let go <eos> 'Cause I hate that it seemed you were never enough <eos> You were broken and bleeding in the name of love <eos> And I hope that we meet in another life <eos> I hope that we meet in another life <eos> I don't hate that I need you <eos> (I don't hate that I need you) <eos> I don't hate that I need you <eos> (I don't hate that I need you) <eos> I don't hate that I need you <eos> 
No matter where you are <eos> I can still hear you when you drown <eos> You've traveled very far <eos> Just to see you I'll come around <eos> When I'm down <eos> All of those yesterdays <eos> Coming down <eos> No matter where you are <eos> I can still hear you when you dream <eos> You traveled very far <eos> You traveled far, like a star <eos> And you are <eos> All of those yesterdays <eos> Coming down <eos> Is it something someone said? <eos> Was it something someone said? <eos> Yesterday the sky was you <eos> And I still feel the same <eos> Nothing left for me to do <eos> And I still feel the same <eos> I wish, I wish I could fly <eos> I wish, I wish I could lie <eos> I will, I will try <eos> I will, I will <eos> Goodbye <eos> 
All of these years, all of this time <eos> Still you got all my attention <eos> I'm feeling it too, when you walk by <eos> Touching my hand like you need it <eos> Across the room, catching my eye <eos> Already know what you're thinking <eos> 'Cause I know all of your secrets <eos> How you talk in your sleep <eos> Play the songs on repeat 'til you know every single word <eos> Those commercials you like, how they all make you cry <eos> How you need a little space when you're hurt <eos> The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up <eos> The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup <eos> I love the way I know that you're lying, the way that you're smiling <eos> Darling, I love that I know you like no one does <eos> Sit on our bed, watch you get dressed <eos> Know we got plans we can break off <eos> I sit and I text all of our friends <eos> Tell 'em we're not gonna make it <eos> All of these years, all of these times that you got all my attention <eos> Yeah, you got all my attention <eos> The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up <eos> The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup <eos> I love the way I know that you're lying, the way that you're smiling <eos> Darling, I love that I know you like no one does <eos> Like no one does <eos> How you talk in your sleep <eos> Play the songs on repeat 'til you know every single word <eos> What you hate, what you like <eos> I see all of your sides and the new ones I'm trying to learn <eos> The way that your hair falls in the morning when you first wake up <eos> The way that I know all of the weird things in your coffee cup <eos> I love the way I know that you're lying, the way that you're smiling <eos> Darling, I love that I know you like no one does <eos> Ooh, like no one does <eos> Ooh, like no one does <eos> And darling, I love that I know you like no one does <eos> 
Y cuando sientas que no puedes más, que no encuentras la salida <eos> No la busques en el mismo bar o en la página amarilla <eos> Cuando el dolor es fuerte no te deja pensar <eos> Siempre habrá una canción que te pueda salvar <eos> En mi Pueblo nadie me entendió, fui un enigma indescifrable <eos> Qué daño causa la estrechez de la gente intolerable <eos> Cuando la mente no comprendе algo, se asusta <eos> Siempre habrá una canción quе te pueda salvar <eos> Sé que nunca fui el más popular en el colegio <eos> Pensé que me querrías aunque no fuera de abolengo, nena <eos> Que me amarías sin pensar en lo demás <eos> Pero me guardaste en una nevera tibia de amistad <eos> Sé que nunca fui el más popular en el colegio <eos> Pensé me querrías aunque no fuera de abolengo como tú <eos> Que me amarías sin pensar en lo demás <eos> Pero me guardaste en una nevera tibia de amistad <eos> 
Honey, you <eos> You can get on a train <eos> Take it to another town <eos> Leave your friends behind <eos> And you <eos> You could even change your clothes <eos> Throw away your blue jeans <eos> Trade em for a suit and tie <eos> But after all this time <eos> I'm still getting used to having you around <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> It's alright <eos> If you wanna start again <eos> Own a little piece of land <eos> Watch the way things grow <eos> And I, I could even follow you there <eos> I could keep the fire lit <eos> Forget what I used to know <eos> I might like the way your face turns brown in the summer <eos> When we're living out in the sun <eos> So please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things you don't need <eos> After all this time <eos> I think I'm getting used to having you around <eos> So please <eos> So please <eos> Please don't change your mind <eos> Change your mind about me <eos> And don't ever set me aside <eos> With the things that you don't need, you don't need <eos> 
Together again, my tears have stopped falling <eos> The long lonely nights are now at an end <eos> The key to my heart you hold in your hand <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos> Together again, the gray skies are gone <eos> You're back in my arms now, where you belong <eos> The love that I knew is living again <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos> And nothing else matters, we're together again <eos> 
Home, I'm making my way home <eos> My mind's already there <eos> Yes, my mind is light <eos> You're with me in the dark <eos> Light my way at night <eos> Let your light shine now <eos> This burden weighs me down <eos> The heaviest of weights <eos> Knocks me to the ground <eos> Right down to the dew <eos> That sparkles on the ground <eos> Blue mountains loom above <eos> Blue mountains loom <eos> And I walk alone <eos> One wish won't be forgotten <eos> Never forget that <eos> Long is the path ahead <eos> And though my body tires <eos> And I have far to go <eos> I know I'm going home <eos> Know I'm going home <eos> Know I'm going home <eos> Know I'm going home <eos> Know I'm going home <eos> Home, I'm making my way home <eos> My mind's already there <eos> Yes, my mind is light <eos> You're with me in the dark <eos> Light my way at night <eos> Let your light shine now <eos> This burden weighs me down <eos> The heaviest of weights <eos> Knocks me to the ground <eos> This burden weighs me down <eos> Burden weighs me down <eos> Burden weighs me down <eos> Burden weighs me down <eos> 
I always thought I was doing fine <eos> Spreading myself around another good time <eos> Then it hit me from out of the blue <eos> I was falling in love with you <eos> But now everything's been changed <eos> My hopes, my dreams <eos> Are rearranged, it's true <eos> And it's all because of you, my baby <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos> Every night I wonder if you know <eos> No matter what they say, I won't let go <eos> Don't ask yourself if I'll always be there <eos> 'Cause forever's how long I'll care <eos> As time goes by and the feeling gets stronger <eos> To be in your arms, can't wait any longer <eos> Look in my eyes and you'll see it's true <eos> Day and night, all my thoughts are of you <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos> I'll be loving you all my life <eos> 'Til my dying day is through <eos> I'll be loving you forever <eos>

Oh, Miles you changed this life for good <eos> It spins in ways I never thought it could <eos> Take all that we have grown and watch how it still blooms <eos> Though I’m far from you <eos> Oh, Miles, I wish you could have stayed <eos> Not only ‘cause I feel you’re hurt the same <eos> We push and pull and tried to stop the rain that left us soaked <eos> I miss you the most <eos> Oh, Miles, where did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Oh, Miles, I hope you find the girl <eos> That sends a shiver through your world <eos> To watch the moment the sun disappears behind thе hill <eos> Our little world so still <eos> Oh, Miles, wherе did you go? <eos> When these are the times I need you the most <eos> Oh my, what have I thrown away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> Away? <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> You found a way when nobody else was holding on <eos> But I couldn’t wait, couldn’t feel the way it was before <eos> 
Stuck in a daydream in Paradise <eos> That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh <eos> Don't need no reason, just livin' life <eos> No time for sleepin' <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, oh, yeah <eos> Had good intentions, guess it went wrong (Ooh) <eos> But I ain't trippin', no-oh <eos> So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long <eos> Went to every bar, underneath the stars, one by one <eos> You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself <eos> Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help <eos> Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> Oh, at least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone <eos> And I spent all of my money on Martinis and rum <eos> Now I only got one dollar 'til the end of the month <eos> Should be sorry, but not sorry <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun (Oh) <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> At least I had fun <eos> 
You don't remember do you, how many times I called your name <eos> Don't mean nothing to you, our separate lives, our lonely days <eos> Suddenly you're asking me to stay <eos> What do you want me to say? <eos> By this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> And every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> Didn't you hear the sirens, baby? <eos> Didn't you see the flames? <eos> So don't complain <eos> If this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> Every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> You have my affеction any time, any place <eos> Call it reconnеction <eos> Call it love <eos> Or the chase <eos> But oh, if you would give me your protection <eos> Instead of giving me so much space <eos> By this time tomorrow <eos> You're gonna be so far away <eos> And every time I think we're solid <eos> You change the game <eos> 
I'm drunk off your kiss <eos> For another night in a row <eos> This is becoming too routine for me <eos> But I didn't mean to lead you on <eos> And it's alright to pretend <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for show, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Please tell me everything <eos> That you think that I should know <eos> About all the plans you made <eos> When I was nowhere to be found <eos> And it's alright to forget <eos> That we still talk <eos> It's just for fun, isn't it? <eos> It's my fault that it fell apart <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you <eos> Just maybe you need this <eos> You need this <eos> And I didn't mean to <eos> Lead you on <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over <eos> You were everything I wanted <eos> (Everything I wanted) <eos> But I just can't finish what I've started <eos> There's no room left here on my back for you <eos> It was damaged long ago <eos> Though you swear that you are true <eos> I'd still pick my friends over you <eos> My friends over you! <eos>

En el pasado y me pone a imaginar <eos> Si mañana te quedas o mañana tú te vas <eos> Yo te amaba mucho, eso no voy a negar <eos> ¿Cómo iba saber que conmigo no sentías igual? <eos> Tu falsedad lo único que me supistes a dar <eos> Mientras yo aquí entregándote lo que tú me pidas <eos> Me lo hiciste mal, eso no se va perdonar <eos> Por tu culpa es imposible pa' volver a amar <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedan bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Todo por tu culpa, chiquitita <eos> Puro Porte Diferente <eos> Mi corazón no tiene sentido, es una piedra <eos> Se acabó el cariño que adentro yo tenía <eos> No tengo motivación para yo continuar <eos> Mi vida se ha acabado desde que tú ya no estás <eos> Por tu culpa ya ni me quiero enamorar <eos> Me voy con otras y quedo bien sentimental <eos> Perdón, chiquita, pero no sé qué tú pensabas <eos> ¿A dónde está tu casa? Ahorita te voy a dejar <eos> Por tu culpa cambiaste todito mi vida <eos> Un diablito que busca amor para lastimar <eos> Te voy a destruir como me lo hicieron a mí <eos> Mejor ni te acerques, porque aquí llegará tu fin <eos> Y puro Rancho Humilde <eos> 
Méteme porque estoy cogiendo el vuelo <eos> En ser el primero en bajarla de las estrellas del cielo <eos> No quiero fuego <eos> Ya llevo mechero <eos> Y si aunque quede mejor igual te pido un Ibuprofeno <eos> Hermano <eos> Iba hasta arriba de Barceló en el maletero <eos> Que no quiero sueldos por ser rapero <eos> Que si cobrara algo lo gastaría en pampero <eos> Me toca cambiar más de suegro que de calcero <eos> Pintalabios negro <eos> Nena vente pa' mi concierto <eos> Dando vueltas por el centro <eos> Dando vueltas sobro el si quiero <eos> O no <eos> Perro viejo <eos> Invito <eos> Bebiendo añejo <eos> A palo seco <eos> A pelo <eos> "Burguer" cinco entrellas <eos> Special one <eos> Echa la ley <eos> Echa la trampa <eos> Y dijeron que no llegaría <eos> Pero dijeron mal <eos> Creían que no lo lograría <eos> Pero creyeron mal <eos> Yo sigo pico y pala <eos> Eh papá <eos> Fui ese uno de mil <eos> No quise a ninguno <eos> Sólo a mí <eos> Definición de superación desde que nací <eos> Orgulloso de vivir <eos> Lo que viví <eos> Llevándome el oro <eos> Como un bandolero <eos> (Pum, pum) <eos> Haciendo del viejo oeste en el este <eos> En su cuerpo el podium <eos> En mi vida el desastre <eos> Primera plaza <eos> Perro de presa nunca pudo con el perro de caza <eos> Con todo puedo <eos> Con cada te quiero cielo <eos> En la cuneta sin triángulos <eos> Y tú, reza, reza <eos> Alekay, Alekay <eos> Por todos lados <eos> Se ríen pero el tanto ríe algún día se lamenta <eos> A mí tan solo me pasa cuando pienso en perderla <eos> Dije representando a Monzón <eos> (Eh) <eos> Y eso chirría <eos> Sigo con mi gente cada día <eos> Sigo partiéndola <eos> Como el primer día <eos> "Alekay's", maravilla <eos> Ciudad bendita <eos> I'm the fucking fruta prohibida <eos> Esos rapers la manzana podrida <eos> Me pongo los cascos y es tan solo mover los labios <eos> Llego tarde <eos> Por miedo a que sea demasiado pronto <eos> Solo quedan cenizas de lo que arde <eos> La quiero ante todo <eos> Me meti en este mundillo hasta el fondo <eos> Lucharemos codo con codo <eos> Por salir de este pozo <eos> Hermano <eos> Vamos subiendo, bajando <eos> Yo soy el Natos <eos> Donde esta mi Waor <eos> La crítica eso es la envidia de no poder lograrlo <eos> Postureo, postureo <eos> Niñas con el Desperados <eos> Yo bebiendo Vodka 40 grados <eos> Buscando a tu amor en los vasos <eos> (Ah, ah) <eos> (Buscando a tu amor en los vasos) <eos> El niño encantador <eos> Que nunca se encanto <eos> Aragón Prim <eos> Representando Monzón <eos> (Eh) <eos> Representing BH <eos> Galego <eos> Aquí rulamos con "Estrella Galicia" en packs <eos> "Ámbar" <eos> Non "Starbucks" <eos> BH <eos> (Ah, ah) <eos>

The tree of life my soul hath seen <eos> Laden with fruit, and always green: <eos> The trees of nature fruitless be <eos> Compared with Christ the apple tree <eos> His beauty doth all things excel: <eos> By faith I know, but ne'er can tell <eos> The glory which I now can see <eos> In Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> For happiness I long have sought <eos> And pleasure dearly I have bought: <eos> I missed of all; but now I see <eos> 'Tis found in Christ the apple tree <eos> I'm weary with my former toil <eos> Here I will sit and rest awhile: <eos> Under the shadow I will be <eos> Of Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos> This fruit doth make my soul to thrive <eos> It keeps my dying faith alive; <eos> Which makes my soul in haste to be <eos> With Jesus Christ the apple tree <eos>

I'll be home for Christmas <eos> You can count on me <eos> Please, have snow and mistletoe <eos> And presents under the tree <eos> Christmas Eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in my dreams <eos> Christmas Eve will find me <eos> Where the love light gleams <eos> I'll be home for Christmas <eos> If only in, if only in, if only in my dreams <eos> 
Fall down <eos> Marigold <eos> Fall sounds of rain <eos> Why can't I go <eos> Those days when spokes wound baseball cards tear hear them roar <eos> And faster still those boards which let fly souls <eos> Honeysuckle walk right afternoon time dies <eos> Wish for sometime soon <eos> I'll work it out <eos> My way <eos> So many faces <eos> So lost <eos> Why can't I go back when this mess was not made <eos> Forever turns out just the same as two months <eos> That rages on then after <eos> 
Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> And tell me, have you found a new man? <eos> Tell me, have you moved on? <eos> 'Cause me, I'm gettin' tired <eos> And this road, it's gettin' hard <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> And it's a fucked up situation I put us in <eos> When the woman I left you for left me for another man <eos> And I guess I should apologize <eos> But I never could lay down my pride <eos> 'Cause it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back down <eos> Oh <eos> And it's street signs and people <eos> Prescription pills and too much booze <eos> All the things I use, tryin' to forget about you <eos> And I still see your face in every single crowd <eos> But you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> No, you're never there to catch me <eos> When I come back <eos> Tell me, darlin', how's your mom been? <eos> How's the weather where you are? <eos> 'Cause me, I've been better <eos> Still chasin' dreams, still shootin' at the stars <eos> 
Me dira basta ya <eos> Y se ira de mi lado <eos> Yo la vi junto a el <eos> Comprendi que habia perdido <eos> Sus ojos le gritaban que lo amaban <eos> Como hace mucho que no hace conmigo <eos> Me mira hoy con pena por que sabe <eos> Que la amo locamente como ayer <eos> Recuerdo aquella luna en su cuarto <eos> El viento acarisiandole la cara <eos> Cuando eramos felicez de estar juntos <eos> Y ahora otro sueño nos separa <eos> Llorare <eos> Quizas si quizas no se no lloras tu <eos> Escribire <eos> Quizas si quizas no si me escribes tu <eos> Mienteme <eos> No me importa creer lo que digas tu <eos> Olvidare <eos> No te he visto con el si lo juras tu <eos> No ves que estoy llorando como un niño como un mendigo pido tu cariño <eos> No tengo dignidad ni tengo orgullo por que te amo mucho mas que eso <eos> Como a dios mismo te estoy rogando eres mi vida no me abandones <eos>

I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> 
Oh, never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop to think <eos> That I'd find myself here with you <eos> In your own world of dreams <eos> Oh, but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> Sometimes I stop and ask <eos> And wonder where you were <eos> Then I rip you from my mind <eos> Cause I thought you didn't care <eos> Oh but here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> This time I know <eos> That my heart is true <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Yeah <eos> I don't know why <eos> I had to play the game of losing you <eos> To make me see <eos> That I still love you <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> But here I am <eos> Again with you <eos> You are my joy <eos> And my joy is you <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oh no, oh no! <eos> Never never, ooh never baby <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> I just can't stop <eos> No, no, no <eos> Never, never, never <eos> Did I ever stop loving you <eos> Oooh  <eos>

I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> What I give, it takes away <eos> Whether I go or when I stay <eos> I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> I see a fire out by the lake <eos> I'll drive my car without the brakes <eos> I see a mountain in my way <eos> It's looming larger by the day <eos> I see a darkness in my fate <eos> I'll drive my car without the brakes <eos> Oh, gimme some time <eos> Show me the foothold from which I can climb <eos> Yeah, when I feel low <eos> You show me a signpost for where I should go <eos> I see a mountain at my gates <eos> I see it more and more each day <eos> And my desire wears a dark dress <eos> Ah, each day, I see you less <eos> Oh, gimme some time <eos> Show me the foothold from which I can climb <eos> Yeah, when I feel low <eos> You show me a signpost for where I should go <eos> Through lanes and stone rows <eos> Black granite, wind blows <eos> Fire lake and far flame <eos> Go now but come again <eos> Dark clouds gather 'round <eos> Will I run or stand my ground? <eos> Oh, when I come to climb <eos> Show me the mountain so far behind <eos> Yeah, it's farther away <eos> Its shadow gets smaller day after day <eos> Yeah, gimme my way <eos> Gimme my love <eos> Gimme my choice <eos> You keep me coming around <eos> Gimme my fate <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my voice <eos> You keep me coming around <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my <eos> Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my, gimme my way <eos> Gimme my fate <eos> Gimme my lungs <eos> Gimme my choice <eos> You keep me coming 'round <eos> 
"Simpsons" season 3 and a thing of hummus <eos> This is all I need <eos> I'm, like, super low-maintenance <eos> But every now and then I wonder why <eos> Just a little bit <eos> I'm slackin' all over the floor <eos> A snail-trail of lazy wherever I go <eos> I'm slackin' all over the floor <eos> Maybe I should read or watch the opera <eos> That don't sound like me <eos> It seems super high-maintenance <eos> But every now and then I wonder why <eos> Just a little bit <eos> I'm slackin' all over the floor <eos> A snail-trail of lazy wherever I go <eos> I'm slackin' all over the floor <eos> And if I do everything that I should <eos> When do I do nothing at all? <eos>

Saturday night I was downtown <eos> Working for the FBI <eos> Sittin' in a nest of bad men <eos> Whiskey bottles piling high <eos> Bootlegging boozer on the west side <eos> Full of people doing wrong <eos> Just about to call up the DA man <eos> When I heard this woman singin' a song <eos> Yeah, a pair of 45's made me open my eyes <eos> My temperature started to rise <eos> She was a long cool woman in a black dress <eos> Just a 5'9, beautiful, tall <eos> With just one look I was a bad mess <eos> 'Cause that long cool woman had it all <eos> I saw her heading to the table <eos> With a tall walking big black cat <eos> Charlie said, "I hope you're able, boy <eos> I'm telling you she knows where it's at" <eos> Then suddenly we heard a siren <eos> Everybody started to run <eos> A-jumping out of doors and tables <eos> Well, I heard somebody shootin' a gun <eos> DA was pumping my left hand <eos> And she was a-holding my right <eos> I told her don't get scared 'cause you're gonna be spared <eos> I've gotta be forgivin' if I wanna spend my living <eos> With a long cool woman in a black dress <eos> Just a 5'9 beautiful tall <eos> With just one look I was a bad mess <eos> 'Cause that long cool woman had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> Had it all <eos> 
Could've been the way <eos> The moonlight hit the dashboard <eos> Passenger window rolled down <eos> That got me thinking <eos> There's something we should talk about <eos> It's not worth waiting out <eos> I can give you space if you need it <eos> You can walk away, I'm not leaving <eos> There's pride in my mouth, I got used to the taste <eos> But I'll swallow it now and I'll be first to say <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos> We could both play the pretender <eos> Circling round this parking lot <eos> While one of us still remembers <eos> We're lucky to have what we've got <eos> We're taking the room for breathing <eos> You can walk away, I'm not leaving <eos> There's pride in your mouth, you got used to the taste <eos> Can you swallow it now when you hear me say <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages, I need you <eos> Thought I could read you <eos> But I lost my place <eos> Now we're on different pages <eos> Those green eyes are my green light <eos> I'm giving up on control <eos> You see red lights <eos> I see me blowing straight through to you <eos> If we're headed for the cliffside <eos> I'm ready for the fall, if you know me at all <eos> You know I don't need lights to decide <eos> I'm not changing my mind <eos>

Tengo puesto un nacimiento en un rincón de mi casa <eos> Con pastores y pastoras y un palacio en la montaña <eos> Ahí vive el rey Herodes, ahí viven sus soldados <eos> Todos están esperando que lleguen los Reyes Magos <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> En el cielo hay una estrella que a los Reyes Magos guía <eos> Hacia Belén para ver a Dios, hijo de María <eos> Cuando pasan los monarcas sale la gente al camino <eos> Y alegres se van con ellos para ver al tierno niño <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Hacia el portal del Belén se dirige un pastorcito <eos> Cantando de esta manera para alegrar el camino <eos> Ha nacido el Niño Dios en un portal miserable <eos> Para enseñar a los hombres la humildad de su linaje <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana está es fiesta y al otro también <eos> Arre, borriquito, arre, burro, arre <eos> Anda más de prisa que llegamos tarde <eos> Arre, borriquito, vamos a Belén <eos> Que mañana es fiesta y al otro también <eos> 
I’ve been waiting <eos> Give me a sign <eos> There’s nothing left to face <eos> Only the time <eos> I see shadows <eos> Devils, decline <eos> I’ve lost my faith in us <eos> Found my design <eos> So now <eos> Where is the enemy? <eos> I can feel no bite <eos> Where is the enemy <eos> When death is on my side? <eos> Something building <eos> Raging inside <eos> This hope gave me release <eos> Gave me a why (Gave me a why) <eos> Can’t shake this ground beneath <eos> I came to fight <eos> So now <eos> Where is the enemy? <eos> I can feel no bite <eos> Where is the enemy <eos> When death is on my side? <eos> Where is the enemy? <eos> I can feel no bite <eos> Where is the enemy <eos> When death is on my side? <eos> Consuming victory <eos> The trumpets calling out to me by name <eos> By name <eos> No looming debt for me <eos> No, death will find his aim to be in vain <eos> In vain <eos> So now <eos> Where is the enemy? <eos> I can feel no bite <eos> Where is the enemy <eos> When death is on my side? <eos>

See the stone set in your eyes <eos> See the thorn twist in your side <eos> I'll wait for you <eos> Sleight of hand and twist of fate <eos> On a bed of nails she makes me wait <eos> And I wait without you <eos> With or without you <eos> With or without you <eos> Through the storm, we reach the shore <eos> You give it all but I want more <eos> And I'm waiting for you <eos> With or without you <eos> With or without you, ah-ah <eos> I can't live with or without you <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> And you give, and you give <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> My hands are tied, my body bruised <eos> She got me with nothing to win <eos> And nothing left to lose <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> And you give, and you give <eos> And you give yourself away <eos> With or without you <eos> With or without you, ohh <eos> I can't live with or without you <eos> With or without you <eos> With or without you, ohh <eos> I can't live with or without you <eos> With or without you <eos> 
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear <eos> You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important <eos> That without them, you feel like nothing <eos> No one will ever understand how much it hurts <eos> You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you <eos> And when it's over and it's gone <eos> You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back <eos> So that you could have the good <eos> Yellow diamonds in the light <eos> And we're standing side by side <eos> As your shadow crosses mine <eos> What it takes to come alive <eos> It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny <eos> But I've gotta let it go <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> Shine a light through an open door <eos> Love and life, I will divide <eos> Turn away 'cause I need you more <eos> Feel the heartbeat in my mind <eos> It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny <eos> But I've gotta let it go <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> Yellow diamonds in the light <eos> And we're standing side by side <eos> As your shadow crosses mine <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos> We found love in a hopeless place <eos>

I looked to my arms <eos> And my legs <eos> And my head <eos> And my chest <eos> And I said that I'm okay <eos> No more thoughts of regret <eos> They're purely electrical signals <eos> So I might've flicked a switch <eos> Oh <eos> It's time to relax <eos> Have a snack and <eos> Walk to the river <eos> Noticed how it is bigger than all of this <eos> You were someone <eos> I met on the internet <eos> Not tonight <eos> You are real <eos> What a rush <eos> What a feel <eos> Take you out on a date <eos> And pretend that were making a ten point <eos> Series about our mistakes <eos> Time to relax <eos> Oh we're both kinda lightweight so <eos> We went for dinner <eos> Hanging with you is different to everything <eos> Wow <eos> 
Listen (Oh) <eos> Listen (Oh) <eos> Echoes <eos> Of your home <eos> Listen (Oh) <eos> Listen (Oh) <eos> 
I can't fool myself, I don't want nobody else to ever love me <eos> You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy <eos> There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you <eos> You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of you <eos> I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you <eos> How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you <eos> You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in <eos> That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much <eos> Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started <eos> I called you up, but you weren't there and I was broken-hearted <eos> Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demanding <eos> Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing <eos> Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar <eos> I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler <eos> Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winning <eos> We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> And I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A thousand kisses from you is never <eos> (Never too much, never too much, never too much) <eos> I just don't wanna stop <eos> Oh, my love <eos> A million days in your arms is never too much <eos> 
It's all on me, it's my mistake <eos> I said "I don't love you" a little too late <eos> But I guess there ain't ever a right time <eos> And I don't know why it's called a goodbye <eos> Go run my name into the ground <eos> Tell everyone you know just how <eos> How I slammed the door on our forever <eos> But I promise you it's for the better <eos> I hope you find what you were looking for <eos> I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore <eos> And you get moving on, all figured out <eos> And you don't hate me somehow <eos> 'Cause I hope you're happy now <eos> Who knew this heart could break this hard <eos> Or a love like ours could fall apart <eos> Without so much as a warning <eos> I thought that I was what you wanted <eos> Well I guess you found what you were looking for <eos> I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore <eos> I'm a wreck, I'm a mess <eos> And I ain't got nothing left <eos> And so I hope you're happy now <eos> I hope you find what you were looking for <eos> I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore <eos> Hope you get moving on, all figured out <eos> And you don't hate me somehow <eos> I'm a wreck, I'm a mess <eos> And I ain't got nothing left <eos> So I hope you're happy now <eos> Happy now <eos> Oh, I hope you're happy now <eos> Mmm <eos>

Wrote my whole life down in a notebook <eos> Songs about you and me <eos> I've been singing to every soul in Tennessee <eos> But nobody seems to listen <eos> And no one ever smiles the way that you do <eos> So I guess you'll never hear me on the radio <eos> And I'd give up this crazy dream of mine <eos> To hold you once more <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> I left home for Hollywood looking for a part to play <eos> Well, you always said I had such a pretty face <eos> But I guess I'm not that pretty <eos> 'Cause no one looks at me the way that you do <eos> Well, you'll always be a movie star to me <eos> And darlin', now I guess it's time that I let go of that dream <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> Well, we're stuck here in these hills that they call mountains <eos> But darlin', back home in your arms is right where I want to be <eos> Won't you meet me in Montana? <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos> I want to see the mountains in your eyes <eos> Oh, I've had all of this life I can handle <eos> Meet me underneath that big Montana sky <eos> In Montana <eos>

Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong <eos> My own beliefs are in my song <eos> The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then <eos> Makes no difference what group I'm in <eos> I am everyday people, yeah, yeah <eos> There is a blue one who can't accept the green one <eos> For living with a fat one, trying to be a skinny one <eos> And different strokes for different folks <eos> And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee <eos> Ooh, sha sha <eos> We got to live together <eos> I am no better and neither are you <eos> We are the same whatever we do <eos> You love me, you hate me, you know me and then <eos> You can't figure out the bag I'm in <eos> I am everyday people, yeah, yeah <eos> There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair <eos> For being such a rich one, that will not help the poor one <eos> And different strokes for different folks <eos> And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee <eos> Ooh, sha sha <eos> We got to live together <eos> There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one <eos> That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one <eos> Different strokes for different folks <eos> And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee <eos> Ooh, sha sha <eos> I am everyday people <eos> 
I will not follow the blind and betray my heart <eos> Let's reveal your cloak and dagger affair <eos> Your obsessive lust for your collapse <eos> To deny the path will be what buries the heart <eos> The conviction you lack will be a haunting voice that remains <eos> Can you feel me in your veins? <eos> Bare your soul and breathe in the blackened frost <eos> To deny the path will be what buries the heart <eos> The conviction you lack will be a haunting voice that remains <eos> To remind you of the past <eos> We're the rejects who wander the sky <eos> We have a place for you here <eos> Tune to our frequency, leave your friends behind <eos> Bring with your decency and peace will find you <eos> I'll catch a stare from your coffin eyes <eos> I'll walk away and leave behind all the weight of the world <eos> I'll carry on, never look back, with no regrets <eos> 
Unholy slumber on the night of your demise <eos> As countless bloody memories come streaming through your eyes <eos> Come to my haunted house - I'll give you what you crave <eos> You're only half - way dead with one foot in your grave <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> The shock upon your face betrays your grim surprise <eos> Your doom is playing out as I've so often fantasized <eos> You must have known that your deceitful life would end this way <eos> I stand above you laughing on your execution day <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos> A choir of rotting angels singing haunting requiems <eos> I see her in the fog as I go walking through the graveyard <eos> My mind replays so many fright-nights come and gone <eos> I'm covered in your blood, I've waited for this for so long <eos> Now I lay thee down to rest, your visage twisted in distress <eos> Your broken corpse is fucking dead and boring me <eos> My darkest fantasies are manifesting in the flesh <eos> I seal in bloody death this bitter love undying <eos> Unholy rapture of the most horrific kind <eos> I'm finally free now that you've met up with my chainsaw <eos> I carved a pentagram into your soft white skin <eos> And spilled your guts upon our hallowed haunting grounds <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> You're gonna die screaming! SCREAMING! <eos> Screaming in the night <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos> You can't run and don't try to hide <eos> There's no way in hell you'll escape with your life <eos> Wake up my darling your nightmare's coming true <eos> And you'll die screaming in the night when we come for you <eos>

Haunting spirit, hear these words that I proclaim <eos> I will guide your journey <eos> And you will have your due of flames <eos> Accept my humble sacrifice of the chosen few <eos> Slain and flayed before the pyre <eos> I'll make your wish come true <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> Burnt black by the fires of death <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> The transition through flames into the night <eos> As the fumes rise from the funeral pyre <eos> Oh, immortals hеar my call, I've shorn my hair and lit the pyre <eos> Thе stars shine and the fires cast light on the mournful choir <eos> Winds, I summon you, from the north and from the west <eos> Gather to feed flames, come forth to greet your guest <eos> Blood is shed <eos> The wine is spilled <eos> Bellowing smoke from the tripods <eos> No words unsaid <eos> The deed fulfilled <eos> An offering to the gods <eos> Gathered now the burnt remains <eos> A stark reminder of the pains <eos> On the road to immortality <eos> Where lesser men would die <eos> The rites are ended on the morrow <eos> The bones interred beneath the barrow <eos> Enshrined in gold forever more <eos> Pray Elysium awaits, and the names go on <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> Burnt black by the fires of death <eos> The beautiful dead that surround me now <eos> The transition through flames into the night <eos> As the fumes rise from the funeral pyre <eos>

The power of love is a curious thing <eos> Make a one man weep, make another man sing <eos> Change a hawk to a little white dove <eos> More than a feeling that's the power of love <eos> Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream <eos> Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream <eos> Make a bad one good make a wrong one right <eos> Power of love that keeps you home at night <eos> You don't need money, don't take fame <eos> Don't need no credit card to ride this train <eos> It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes <eos> But it might just save your life <eos> That's the power of love <eos> That's the power of love <eos> First time you feel it, it might make you sad <eos> Next time you feel it, it might make you mad <eos> But you'll be glad baby when you've found <eos> That's the power makes the world go'round <eos> And it don't take money, don't take fame <eos> Don't need no credit card to ride this train <eos> It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes <eos> But it might just save your life <eos> They say that all in love is fair <eos> Yeah, but you don't care <eos> But you know what to do <eos> When it gets hold of you <eos> And with a little help from above <eos> You feel the power of love <eos> You feel the power of love <eos> Can you feel it? <eos> Hmmm <eos> It don't take money and it don't take fame <eos> Don't need no credit card to ride this train <eos> Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel <eos> You won't feel nothin' till you feel <eos> You feel the power, just feel the power of love <eos> That's the power, that's the power of love <eos> You feel the power of love <eos> You feel the power of love <eos> Feel the power of love <eos> 
August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> My face above the water <eos> My feet can't touch the ground <eos> Touch the ground, and it feels like <eos> I can see the sands on the horizon <eos> Every time you are not around <eos> I'm slowly drifting away (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away, drifting, drifting away) <eos> I wish I could make it easy <eos> Easy to love me, love me <eos> But still I reach, to find a way <eos> I'm stuck here in between <eos> I'm looking for the right words to say <eos> I'm slowly drifting, drifting away <eos> Wave after wave, wave after wave <eos> I'm slowly drifting (Drifting away) <eos> And it feels like I'm drowning <eos> Pulling against the stream <eos> Pulling against the wave <eos>

I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way <eos> Seems like yesterday <eos> I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away <eos> I've never been the same <eos> I felt the strangest feeling <eos> Like a raging fire it burned <eos> She left, I cried for weeks <eos> And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away <eos> Had to earn my pay <eos> Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say <eos> It only ended up the same way <eos> And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone? <eos> Oh, girl, you answered my question <eos> This time it's working, you've given me new hope <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you <eos> It's got a power of its own <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> (Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho <eos> (Love changes) Let's make love <eos> (Love changes everything) Oh <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl (Love changes) <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> 
In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> 
(Do you believe?) Walk on water <eos> Can you even see what you're fighting for? <eos> Blood lust and a holy war <eos> Listen up, hear the patriot shout: <eos> "Times are changing" <eos> In the end, the choice was clear <eos> Take a shot in the face of fear <eos> Fist up in the firing line <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> (Do you believe?) <eos> Look at the sky, see a dying star <eos> White lies, it's a man on fire <eos> Making love with the devil hurts <eos> Times are changing <eos> A thin line, the whole truth <eos> The far right, the left view <eos> Breaking all those promises made <eos> Times are changing <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe that you can walk on water? <eos> Do you believe that you can win this fight tonight? <eos> Do you believe?

April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom <eos> Holiday tables under the trees <eos> April in Paris, this is a feeling <eos> That no one can ever reprise <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos> I never knew the charm of spring <eos> Never met it face to face <eos> I never knew my heart could sing <eos> Never missed a warm embrace <eos> Till April in Paris <eos> Whom can I run to <eos> What did you mean to <eos> What have you done to <eos> My heart <eos>

I don't need you to love me, I can't be broken twice <eos> Just tell me I'm beautiful as we lie down, that will suffice <eos> Don't look so guilty as though you've done me wrong <eos> I'm not your victim to be pitied <eos> I'm not yours at all for long <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Ahh Ahhh <eos> But you kissed me too softly and then I felt used <eos> You told me I was there, your call to arms your muse <eos> Don't act so bewitched as though you tried to stay true <eos> Did I enchant you with my voice, was it my hair that maddened you? <eos> Such excuses are heard only in songs <eos> From a time before you and I <eos> There is no great romance here, no <eos> Just a lust you tried to glorify <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> Oooh ooh ooh <eos> I'll never let you hurt me, I'll never let you in <eos> A fool was I to indulge in such sordid dealings <eos> I won't let this bruise me, the choice is my own <eos> Not to let another use me and learn to be alone <eos> Oh, with your hands you cheapened me <eos> And I'll never let another weaken me <eos> Go back to her running, that's my advice <eos> You won't find me running after <eos> I can't be broken twice <eos> Leave and go back to her running, take my advice <eos> Your cold heart couldn't bother one, long since turned to ice <eos> 
I left Oklahoma, drivin' in a Pontiac <eos> Just about to lose my mind <eos> I was goin' to Arizona <eos> Maybe on to California <eos> Where the people all live so fine <eos> My baby said, I'z crazy <eos> My mama called me lazy <eos> I was gonna show 'em all this time <eos> 'Cause you know I ain't no fool <eos> And I don't need no more schoolin' <eos> I was born to just walk the line <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Well, you'll know I been through it <eos> When I set my watch back to it <eos> Livin' on Tulsa Time <eos> Well, there I was in Hollywood <eos> Wishin' I was doin' good <eos> Talkin' on the telephone line <eos> But they don't need me in the movies <eos> And nobody sings my songs <eos> Guess, I'm just a wastin' time <eos> Well, then I got to thinkin' <eos> Man I'm really sinkin' <eos> An I really had a flash this time <eos> I had no business leavin' <eos> An nobody would be grievin' <eos> If I just went on back to Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Gonna set my watch back to it <eos> 'Cause you know I been through it <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> Gonna set my watch back to it <eos> 'Cause you know I been through <eos> Livin' on Tulsa time <eos> 
Intéressé(e) par l'explication des paroles de cette chanson ou d'autres ? Venez faire l'analyse des textes avec nous ! <eos> Y a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans <eos> Y veut t'piquer ta pelle et ton seau <eos> Ta couche-culotte avec les bombecs dedans <eos> Lolita défends-toi, fous-y un coup d'rateau dans l'dos <eos> Attends un peu avant d'te faire emmerder <eos> Par ces p'tits machos qui pensent qu'à une chose <eos> Jouer au docteur non conventionné <eos> J'y ai joué aussi je sais de quoi j'cause <eos> J'les connais bien les play-boys des bacs à sable <eos> J'draguais leur mère avant d'connaître la tienne <eos> Si tu les écoutes y t'f'ront porter leur cartable <eos> Heureusement qu'j'suis là, que j'te r'garde et que j't'aime <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Comme j'en ai marre de m'faire tatouer des machins <eos> Qui m'font comme une bande dessinée sur la peau <eos> J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés <eos> Un par un, plantés dans le cuir de mon blouson dans l'dos <eos> T'es la seule gonzesse que j'peux t'nir dans mes bras <eos> Sans m'démettre une épaule sans plier sous ton poids <eos> Tu pèses moins lourd qu'un moineau qui mange pas <eos> Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas <eos> Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes <eos> Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat <eos> Tu risques d'donner faim à un tas de p'tits mecs <eos> Quand t'iras à l'école si jamais t'y vas <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Qu'est-ce tu m'racontes ? Tu veux un petit frangin ? <eos> Tu veux qu'j't'achète un ami Pierrot ? <eos> Eh ! Les bébés ça s'trouve pas dans les magasins et j'crois pas <eos> Que ta mère voudra qu'j'lui fasse un p'tit dans l'dos <eos> Ben quoi Lola on est pas bien ensemble ? <eos> Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux ? <eos> T'entends pas ce bruit c'est le monde qui tremble <eos> Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux <eos> Allez viens avec moi j't'embarque dans ma galère <eos> Dans mon arche y'a d'la place pour tous les marmots <eos> Avant qu'ce monde devienne un grand cimetière <eos> Faut profiter un peu du vent qu'on a dans l'dos <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> 
I used to think that I deserved this <eos> Tried my best but never perfect <eos> I was helpless, and you know it <eos> You like to think you're a martyr, but you're just abusive, so now <eos> I'm not afraid to admit that there's nothing left <eos> I know you try to manipulate me again <eos> But I've come to grips with the fact that what's dead is dead <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would'vе never let you in <eos> Yеah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> All the years spent with a vermin <eos> Left me soul-sick, always searching <eos> I learned that trust is really worth it <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> You can't believe what you hear from the mouth of a serpent <eos> What's dead is dead, what's dead is dead, what's dead is dead <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> This is cut ties, no goodbye, nail in the coffin <eos> This is the nail in the coffin <eos> You fooled me once, twice never again <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> You were never being honest <eos> I bet that this is what you wanted <eos> I can't believe you got the best of me again <eos> I thought that you were being honest <eos> And now I wish I would've never let you in <eos> Yeah, I know it's my fault <eos> I love deep then lose it all <eos> I guess I wanted to believe it <eos> But blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> Blood's not thicker than water after all <eos> 
It's not a silly little moment <eos> It's not the storm before the calm <eos> This is the deep and dying breath of <eos> This love that we've been working on <eos> Can't seem to hold you like I want to <eos> So I can feel you in my arms <eos> Nobody's going to come and save you <eos> We pulled too many false alarms <eos> We're going down <eos> And you can see it, too <eos> We're going down <eos> And you know that we're doomed <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> I was the one you always dreamed of <eos> You were the one I tried to draw <eos> How dare you say it's nothing to me? <eos> Baby, you're the only light I ever saw <eos> I'll make the most of all the sadness <eos> You'll be a bitch, because you can <eos> You try to hit me, just to hurt me <eos> So you leave me feeling dirty <eos> 'Cause you can't understand <eos> We're going down <eos> And you can see it, too <eos> We're going down <eos> And you know that we're doomed <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> 
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> The kids were young and pretty <eos> Where have you been? Where did you go? <eos> Those summer nights seem long ago <eos> And so is the girl you used to call <eos> The Queen of New York City <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> The power of youth is on my mind <eos> Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time <eos> Will you still love me when I shine <eos> From words but not from beauty? <eos> My father's love was always strong <eos> My mother's glamour lives on and on <eos> Yet still inside, I felt alone <eos> For reasons unknown to me <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> And if you call, I'll run, run, run <eos> If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> And we were young and pretty <eos> 
Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain <eos> Out of your favorite dress? <eos> Black mascara off a pillowcase? <eos> Cure a one-too-many headache? <eos> Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days <eos> This weekend or next? <eos> And hey, how do you get a red wine stain <eos> Out of your favorite dress? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> Can you ask Daddy if he's got time <eos> To come and look at my front door? <eos> It got slammed last night <eos> And now it don't close right <eos> And just promise that you won't tell him everything <eos> And keep that pistol in the drawer <eos> Mama, please don't say <eos> I'm gonna laugh about this someday <eos> You didn't see the way he drove away <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> Oh, a broken heart <eos> Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard) <eos> Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark) <eos> Was it ever really real <eos> If he don't feel like I feel? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> How does he sleep at night? <eos> Mama, the nerve of this guy <eos> To leave me so easy <eos> Am I gonna be alright? <eos> I wanna kick myself for falling so hard <eos> Mama, can you die from a broken heart? <eos> A broken heart <eos> 
Se le respeta, del señor de Culiacán carga la camiseta <eos> Los radios sonando, siempre se ponen alerta <eos> Rugen los motores y también las metralletas <eos> Todos sus muchachos firmes, fieles a la empresa <eos> Ya saben que lo que se usa aquí es la cabeza <eos> No me espanto del gobierno ni de la pobreza <eos> Y los que la deben no se acercan, nomás rezan <eos> Y lloran en el panteón <eos> Al tiro por 'onde anda, pues él es el que manda <eos> Nadie lo baja del puesto y para ser honesto <eos> Se ganó el respeto, oh-oh <eos> Y conserva su puesto, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> En el carro va contando <eos> Pacas de las verdes es la' que va duplicando <eos> Y el que juega a traición él se lo lleva de encargo <eos> Y en la lista negra su nombre voy agregando <eos> Llenas las cuentas <eos> Conectados con los grandes mandando libretas <eos> Se les nota el porte que el muchacho representa <eos> Y el jale es calidad, por eso aumentan las ventas <eos> Si es porque él así lo decidió <eos> Compa Dan <eos> Y puros corridos tumbados, viejones <eos> Así nomás, mi compa Nata <eos> Ya sabe cómo es el rollo <eos> Su compa Oscar Maydon <eos> Representando la bandera <eos> Y puro Morales viejo, ¡eah! <eos> En camionetas blindadas, las rápidas se vieron por la sierra <eos> .50 montados, equipados pa' dar guerra <eos> Hombres listos que prefieren quedar bajo tierra <eos> Antes de fallar una misión <eos> Bien al cien con la plebada, pues no pasa nada <eos> Mandando kilos de la verde y también de lavada <eos> Todos bien activos para cualquier situación <eos> Con los radios en las manos para entrar en acción <eos> Todo está al cien con los viejos <eos> Aquí nada corre chueco, todo camina derecho <eos> Y una santa que lo cuida y esa la cuelga en el pecho <eos> La confianza me he ganado y eso lo hicieron mis hechos <eos> Ya con esta me despido <eos> Y ando cuidando el terreno y ese nunca lo descuido <eos> Culiacán, esta es mi casa, mi Sinaloa tan querido <eos> Donde tengo buen respaldo de mis más grandes amigos <eos>

Vivo fingiendo un sueño que no se cuenta <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> Pero el amor se escapa, aunque yo te mienta <eos> Yo estaba buscándote, sola aquí esperándote <eos> Y tú, mirándome sin hablar <eos> Y yo, hablándote sin mirar <eos> Y tú, no sé lo que estás sintiendo <eos> Pero yo me estoy muriendo <eos> No aguanto más <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos> El mar de tu piel, quiero navegar <eos> Perderme en las olas contigo <eos> Bailando en las olas contigo <eos> Un barco de papel, te quiero regalar <eos> Para que vengas conmigo <eos> Bailando en las olas conmigo <eos> Y tú, mirándome sin hablar <eos> Y yo, hablándote sin mirar <eos> Y tú, ya sé lo que estás sintiendo <eos> Ya sabes que estoy muriendo <eos> No aguanto más <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos esta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos> Cuando bailas brillan las estrellas <eos> Todas se derriten sobre el mar <eos> Espuma sobre el mar <eos> Sigo caminando tras tus huellas <eos> Y aunque se derriten en el mar <eos> Yo te voy a encontrar <eos> Bailar contigo, y perdernos ésta noche <eos> Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más <eos> Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores <eos> Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote <eos> (Uououououo) <eos> Vivo imaginándote <eos> 
I was just a wandering soul <eos> Working through the highs and lows <eos> I heard a spirit whisper slow <eos> Drift into a great unknown <eos> Will anybody see my ghost? <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I began to hear my name <eos> And silence in a hurricane <eos> The dust was leaving from my veins <eos> Like some forgotten border train <eos> Carried to my home again <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I wade in darkness <eos> But I can feel you calling, hear you calling <eos> As I shut my wanting eyes <eos> I said I'd love you 'till I die <eos> Ah <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos>

Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo <eos> Caigo de nuevo en tu red <eos> Sé que tarda un tiempo <eos> Curarme de ti de una vez <eos> Tuve tantos momentos felices <eos> Que olvido lo triste que fue <eos> Darte de mi alma <eos> Lo que tú echaste a perder <eos> Yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> Y en la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Tienes, la misma culpa que tengo <eos> Aunque te cueste admitir <eos> Que sientes como siento <eos> La almohada no suele mentir <eos> Y yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer <eos> Cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos>

It's Christmas time <eos> There's no need to be afraid <eos> At Christmas time <eos> We let in light and we banish shade <eos> And in our world of plenty <eos> We can spread a smile of joy <eos> Throw your arms around the world <eos> At Christmas time <eos> But say a prayer <eos> Pray for the other ones <eos> At Christmas time it's hard <eos> But when you're having fun <eos> n <eos> There's a world outside your window <eos> And it's a world of dread and fear <eos> Where the only water flowing <eos> Is the bitter sting of tears <eos> And the Christmas bells that ring there <eos> Are the clanging chimes of doom <eos> Well tonight thank God it's them <eos> Instead of you <eos> And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time <eos> The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh) <eos> Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow <eos> Do they know it's Christmas time at all? <eos> Here's to you <eos> Raise a glass for everyone <eos> Here's to them <eos> Underneath that burning sun <eos> Do they know it's Christmas time at all? <eos> Feed the world <eos> Feed the world <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> Feed the world <eos> Let them know it's Christmas time again <eos> 
Hush my baby, Don't you cry <eos> I'll dry your eyes. Fulfill your heart's desire <eos> Let's go in. Try again <eos> Careful this time. Broken promises linger in our mind <eos> I'll give in completely. Hearts break so easy <eos> I know. Believe me. Oh, I've tried <eos> But my arms can hold you. My kiss console you <eos> I'll come and love you tonight <eos> And I... <eos> I love, I love, I love <eos> Love hurts sometimes <eos> But this feels right <eos> You... <eos> You love, you love, you love <eos> Though you've been burned <eos> You still return <eos> Come and share my house, my home, and all I own <eos> I'd love to give to you <eos> Aren't you tired of going along this lonely road? <eos> It takes its toll on you <eos> Give me your emotion, your heart's devotion <eos> Give anything you like <eos> And I'll give understanding. Life's so demanding <eos> I'm all you need to get by <eos> And I... <eos> I love, I love, I love <eos> Love hurts sometimes <eos> But this feels right <eos> And You... <eos> You love, you love, you love <eos> Though you've been burned <eos> You still return <eos> I love, I love, I love <eos> Love hurts sometimes <eos> But this feels right <eos> And You... <eos> You love you love you love <eos> Though you've been burned <eos> You still return <eos> Still return <eos> Still return to love (Oh) <eos> Keep coming back to love (Ah oh) <eos> 
Goin' down like a sunset <eos> Burnin' out like a cigarette <eos> Blowin' through the cash, through the past <eos> Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left <eos> I could go on and on <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> I could drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> Trying to ride out the midnight <eos> Trying to fight through the daylight <eos> Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that <eos> I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> Why you're gone <eos> I could blame it on the whiskey <eos> I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me <eos> Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could blame it on a good high <eos> Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye <eos> Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times <eos> Should've never let you go <eos> Should've never watched you go <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah) <eos> I could say I never knew <eos> Yeah, I can drink around the truth <eos> But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?) <eos> Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?) <eos> 
We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But I'm always looking forward for an open door <eos> I found an outlet for all my feelings <eos> They're trying to cut the cord <eos> I'm thinking we've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> But there's always a place for you here in my wild heart <eos> I dream of you on a highway under a thousand stars <eos> We can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> We can have it all <eos> I can make it on my own <eos> We've got to run <eos> If you're holding on the seams will come undone <eos> And you'll only get part of me <eos> We don't want to catch a break while we're playing it safe <eos> You'll only get part of me <eos> And you can have it all <eos> Just like we're dreaming <eos> 
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining <eos> It's the night of our dear Savior's birth <eos> Long lay the world in sin and error pining <eos> 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth <eos> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <eos> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn <eos> Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices! <eos> O night divine, O night when Christ was born <eos> O night divine, O night divine! <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> 
Ooh, let's go! <eos> Steve walks warily down the street <eos> With the brim pulled way down low <eos> Ain’t no sound but the sound of his feet <eos> Machine guns ready to go <eos> Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this? <eos> Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? <eos> Out of the doorway the bullets rip <eos> To the sound of the beat, yeah <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> And another one gone, and another one gone <eos> Another one bites the dust, yeah <eos> Hey, I'm gonna get you too <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> How do you think I'm going to get along <eos> Without you, when you’re gone <eos> You took me for everything that I had <eos> And kicked me out on my own <eos> Are you happy, are you satisfied? <eos> How long can you stand the heat? <eos> Out of the doorway the bullets rip <eos> To the sound of the beat <eos> Look out <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> And another one gone, and another one gone <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Hey, I'm gonna get you, too <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Hey <eos> Oh, take it <eos> Bite the dust, hey <eos> Bites the dust, hey <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Another one bites the dust, ow <eos> Another one bites the dust, hey hey <eos> Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh <eos> Ooh, shootout <eos> There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man <eos> And bring him to the ground <eos> You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad <eos> And leave him when he's down, yeah <eos> But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you <eos> I'm standing on my own two feet <eos> Out of the doorway the bullets rip <eos> Repeating to the sound of the beat <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> And another one gone, and another one gone <eos> Another one bites the dust, yeah <eos> Hey, I'm gonna get you, too <eos> Another one bites the dust <eos> Shootout <eos> Ay-yeah <eos> Alright <eos>

I saw the part of you <eos> That only when you're older, you will see too <eos> You will see too <eos> I held the better cards <eos> But every stroke of luck has gotta bleed through <eos> It's gotta bleed through <eos> You held the balance of the time <eos> That only blindly I could read you <eos> But I could read you <eos> It's like you told me <eos> Go forward slowly <eos> It's not a race to the end <eos> Well, you look like yourself <eos> But you're somebody else <eos> Only it ain't on the surface <eos> Well, you talk like yourself <eos> No, I hear someone else though <eos> Now you're making me nervous <eos> You were the better part <eos> Of every bit of beating heart that I had <eos> Whatever I had <eos> I finally sat alone <eos> Pitch black flesh and bone <eos> Couldn't believe that you were gone <eos> Well, you look like yourself <eos> But you're somebody else <eos> Only it ain't on the surface <eos> Well, you talk like yourself <eos> No, I hear someone else though <eos> Now you're making me nervous <eos> Well, you look like yourself <eos> But you're somebody else <eos> Only it ain't on the surface (Surface) <eos> Well, you talk like yourself <eos> No, I hear someone else though <eos> Now you're making me nervous (Nervous) <eos> Where are we? <eos> Where are we? <eos> Well, you look like yourself <eos> But you're somebody else <eos> Only it ain't on the surface <eos> Well, you talk like yourself <eos> No, I hear someone else though <eos> Now you're making me nervous <eos> Well, you look like yourself <eos> But you're somebody else <eos> Only it ain't on the surface <eos> Well, you talk like yourself <eos> No, I hear someone else though <eos> Now you're making me nervous <eos> I saw the part of you <eos> That only when you're older, you will see too <eos> You will see too <eos> 
I wish we could cut all ties with the morning light <eos> Because our secret’s in the dark <eos> And though I don’t take it to heart <eos> I just need more time <eos> To appreciate what we’ll leave behind <eos> Like the feeling when you’re holding me still with your eyes <eos> It’s as real as the stars that freckle the sky <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> And all of the light we’re missing <eos> Thanks to the sun’s indifference <eos> Oh limited time is hard to survive <eos> With no sacrifice <eos> But conversation’s flowing <eos> Further than every ocean <eos> Oh please tell me why <eos> Please tell me why <eos> This feels so right <eos> But how long will we fall <eos> For how long will we fall <eos> Before we can climb? <eos> And will this get too hard <eos> Will we even get far <eos> Will our words suffice? <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Let’s just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I wanna know what it’s like <eos> Lets just erase all the downsides <eos> If not forever then just for tonight <eos> Give me all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> Oh there’s no need to clarify <eos> I know I’ll have your heart in time <eos> It’s just so hard when you’re all I desire <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine, we’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos> We’ll be fine <eos> I just want all of you <eos> Trust me, I know that we’ll be fine <eos>

Come on, skinny love, just last the year <eos> Pour a little salt, we were never here <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer <eos> I tell my love to wreck it all <eos> Cut out all the ropes and let me fall <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Right in this moment, this order's tall <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And in the morning I'll be with you <eos> But it will be a different kind <eos> And I'll be holding all the tickets <eos> And you'll be owning all the fines <eos> Come on, skinny love, what happened here? <eos> Suckle on the hope in light brassieres <eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my <eos> Sullen load is full, so slow on the split <eos> And I told you to be patient <eos> And I told you to be fine <eos> And I told you to be balanced <eos> And I told you to be kind <eos> And now all your love is wasted <eos> And then who the hell was I? <eos> And I'm breaking at the britches <eos> And at the end of all your lines <eos> Who will love you? <eos> Who will fight? <eos> Who will fall far behind? <eos> 
Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Gave thee life & bid thee feed <eos> By the stream & o'er the mead; <eos> Gave thee clothing of delight <eos> Softest clothing wooly bright; <eos> Gave thee such a tender voice <eos> Making all the vales rejoice! <eos> Little Lamb who made thee <eos> Dost thou know who made thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee <eos> Little Lamb I'll tell thee! <eos> He is called by thy name <eos> For he calls himself a Lamb: <eos> He is meek & he is mild <eos> He became a little child: <eos> I a child & thou a lamb <eos> We are called by his name <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> Little Lamb God bless thee <eos> 
In the midst of my confusion <eos> In the time of desperate need <eos> When I am thinking not too clearly <eos> A gentle voice does intercede <eos> Slow down, slow down, be still <eos> Be still and wait, on the Spirit of the Lord <eos> Slow down and hear His voice <eos> And know that He is God <eos> In the time of tribulation <eos> When I'm feeling so unsure <eos> When things are pressing in about me <eos> Comes a gentle voice so still, so pure <eos> Slow down, slow down, be still, my child <eos> Be still and wait, on the Spirit of the Lord <eos> Slow down and hear His voice <eos> And know that He is God <eos> And know that He is God <eos> 
Hey you, big star <eos> Tell me when it's over <eos> (Cloud) <eos> Hey you, big mood <eos> Guide me to shelter <eos> 'Cause I'm through when the two <eos> Hits the six and it's summer <eos> (Cloud) <eos> (Come) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (Shove) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (The sun) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (Aside) Shove it aside! <eos> I think God is moving its tongue <eos> There's no crowds in the street and no sun <eos> In my own summer <eos> The shade is a tool, a device, a savior <eos> See, I try and look up to the sky <eos> But my eyes burn <eos> (Cloud) <eos> (Come) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (Shove) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (The sun) Shove it! Shove it! Shove it! <eos> (Aside) Shove it aside! <eos> (Come) Shove! Shove it!

Each time we have a quarrel <eos> It almost breaks my heart <eos> 'Cause I'm so afraid <eos> That we will have to part <eos> Each night I ask the stars up above <eos> Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> One day, I feel so happy <eos> The next day, I feel so sad <eos> I guess I'll learn to take <eos> The good with the bad <eos> 'Cause each night I ask the stars up above <eos> Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> I cried a tear <eos> For nobody but you <eos> I'll be a lonely one <eos> If you should say we're through <eos> Well, if you want to make me cry <eos> That won't be so hard to do <eos> If you should say goodbye <eos> I'll still go on loving you <eos> Each night I ask the stars up above <eos> Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> I cried a tear <eos> For nobody but you <eos> I'll be a lonely one <eos> If you should say we're through <eos> Well, if you want to make me cry <eos> That won't be so hard to do <eos> And if you should say goodbye <eos> I'll still go on loving you <eos> Each night I ask the stars up above <eos> Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> (In love) Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> (In love) Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> (In love) Why must I be a teenager in love? <eos> 
Es tan difícil no extrañarte <eos> Esa manera de quererte no la he vuelto a conseguir <eos> No viajo solo, hay alguien más <eos> Y aunque la adoro <eos> Nadie ocupa tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> No hay nadie nunca en tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> Dicen que el tiempo encuentra el modo (Mmm) <eos> Pero cuando hablo con el tiempo me pregunta sobre ti <eos> Lo desahogo <eos> ¿En dónde estás? Aún te adoro <eos> Nadie ocupa tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> No hay nadie nunca en tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> Nunca aprendí a olvidar, contigo me quedé <eos> En ti encontré un amor que nunca superé <eos> Por ti aprendí a reír, pero también lloré <eos> Yo te he buscado en tantos besos y no te encontré <eos> Por ti perdí la voz, pero por ti canté <eos> Esas canciones de los dos que luego no borré <eos> Pero no digo adiós, en Dios yo tengo fe <eos> Pa' que te diga que por ti yo todo lo intenté <eos> Y nadie ocupa tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> Nadie ocupa en tu lugar <eos> Y yo, aunque jamás volví <eos> Lo intenté todo <eos> Lo intenté todo por ti <eos> Oh-oh <eos> Mmm, mmm <eos> Oh-oh-oh <eos> Oh-oh <eos> 
Sitting in a park in Paris, France <eos> Reading the news and it sure looks bad <eos> They won't give peace a chance <eos> That was just a dream some of us had <eos> Still a lot of lands to see <eos> But I wouldn't wanna stay here <eos> It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here <eos> Oh, but California <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> I'm going to see the folks I dig <eos> I'll even kiss a Sunset pig <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> I met a redneck on a Grecian isle <eos> Who did the goat dance very well <eos> He gave me back my smile <eos> But he kept my camera to sell <eos> Oh, the rogue, the red red rogue <eos> He cooked good omelets and stews <eos> And I might have stayed on with him there <eos> But my heart cried out for you, California <eos> Oh, California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, make me feel good rock 'n roll band <eos> I'm your biggest fan <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, it gets so lonely <eos> When you're walking <eos> And the streets are full of strangers <eos> All the news of home you read <eos> Just gives you the blues <eos> Just gives you the blues <eos> So I bought me a ticket <eos> I got on a plane to Spain <eos> Went to a party down a red dirt road <eos> There were lots of pretty people there <eos> Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue <eos> They said, "How long can you hang around?" <eos> I said a week, maybe two <eos> Just until my skin turns brown <eos> Then I'm going home to California <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, will you take me as I am <eos> Strung out on another man <eos> California, I'm coming home <eos> Oh, it gets so lonely <eos> When you're walking <eos> And the streets are full of strangers <eos> All the news of home you read <eos> More about the war <eos> And the bloody changes <eos> Oh, will you take me as I am? <eos> Will you take me as I am? <eos> Will you? <eos> Will you take me as I am? <eos> Hmmm mmmmm <eos> Take me as I am <eos>

I'm sittin' in the railway station <eos> Got a ticket for my destination, mmm <eos> On a tour of one night stands <eos> My suitcase and guitar in hand <eos> And every stop is neatly planned <eos> For a poet and a one man band <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Everyday's an endless stream <eos> Of cigarettes and magazines, Mmm <eos> And each town looks the same to me <eos> The movies and the factories <eos> And every stranger's face I see <eos> Reminds me that I long to be <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Tonight I'll sing my songs again <eos> I'll play the game and pretend, mmm <eos> But all my words come back to me <eos> In shades of mediocrity <eos> Like emptiness in harmony <eos> I need someone to comfort me <eos> Homeward bound <eos> I wish I was <eos> Homeward bound <eos> Home, where my thought's escaping <eos> Home, where my music's playing <eos> Home, where my love lies waiting <eos> Silently for me <eos> Silently for me <eos> 
Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know I'm just a flight away <eos> If you want it, you could take a private plane <eos> A kilómetros estamos conectando <eos> Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando <eos> You know I got a lot to say <eos> All these voices in the background of my brain <eos> Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando <eos> Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> You know that I can see right through you <eos> I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> What you wanna do? <eos> It's written all over your face, times two <eos> 'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind <eos> I can hear your thoughts like a melody <eos> Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep <eos> You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe <eos> (On repeat) <eos> Quién lo diría que se podría <eos> Hacer el amor por telepatía <eos> La luna está llena, mi cama vacía <eos> Lo que yo te haría <eos> Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría <eos> De noche y de día, de noche y de día <eos> (You know I got a lot to say) <eos> (All these voices in the background of my brain) <eos> 
She says she's no good <eos> With words, but I'm worse <eos> Barely stuttered out <eos> A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue <eos> Weighed down with words too <eos> Overdramatic <eos> Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse" <eos> Versus "No one should ever feel like..." <eos> I'm two quarters and a heart down <eos> And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds <eos> These words are all I have so I write them <eos> So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ) <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me <eos> You always fold just <eos> Before you're found out <eos> Drink up, it's last call, last resort <eos> But only the first mistake, and I <eos> I'm two quarters and a heart down <eos> And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds <eos> These words are all I have so I write them <eos> So you need them just to get by <eos> Why don't you show me the little bit of spine <eos> You've been saving for his mattress, love <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me <eos> Why don't you show me the little bit of spine <eos> You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress) <eos> I only want sympathy in the form of you <eos> Crawling into bed with me <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love) <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love) <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me... <eos> Dance, dance, dance, dance <eos> Dance, dance, dance, dance <eos>

I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire <eos> You come to me, come to me, wild and wild <eos> When you come to me, give me everything I need <eos> Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams <eos> Speak the language of love like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong, baby <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone, anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart? No, no! <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> In your heart I see the start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone, anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart? No, no! <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> Each time you leave me I start losing control <eos> You're walking away with my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel you even when I'm alone <eos> Oh, baby, don't let go <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone, anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Tear us apart?

Don't ask me <eos> What you know is true <eos> Don't have to tell you <eos> I love your precious heart <eos> I... I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never tear us apart <eos> We could live <eos> For a thousand years <eos> But if I hurt you <eos> I'd make wine from your tears <eos> I told you <eos> That we could fly <eos> 'Cause we all have wings <eos> But some of us don't know why <eos> I... I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never, ever tear us apart <eos> I... I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never ever tear us apart <eos> You... You were standing <eos> I was there <eos> Two worlds collided <eos> And they could never tear us apart <eos> I... I was standing <eos> You were there <eos> 
One night to be confused <eos> One night to speed up truth <eos> We had a promise made <eos> Four hands and then away <eos> Both under influence <eos> We had divine sense <eos> To know what to say <eos> Mind is a razor-blade <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> One night of magic rush <eos> The start: a simple touch <eos> One night to push and scream <eos> And then relief <eos> Ten days of perfect tunes <eos> The colors red and blue <eos> We had a promise made <eos> We were in love <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> And you, you knew the hand of a devil <eos> And you, kept us awake with wolves teeth <eos> Sharing different heartbeats in one night <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Would that be good enough for me <eos> To call for hands of above, to lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough for me <eos> 
It's a mystery to me <eos> We have a greed, with which we have agreed <eos> You think you have to want more than you need <eos> Until you have it all, you won't be free <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> When you want more than you have, you think you need <eos> And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed <eos> I think I need to find a bigger place <eos> 'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> There's those thinking more or less less is more <eos> But if less is more how you keeping score? <eos> Means for every point you make your level drops <eos> Kinda like you're starting from the top <eos> And you can't do that <eos> Society, you're a crazy breed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely without me <eos> Society, have mercy on me <eos> I hope you're not angry if I disagree <eos> Society, crazy, indeed <eos> I hope you're not lonely, without me <eos> 
Destiny left its mark in the room <eos> It's got me open wide, now I'm waking at noon <eos> How can I forget your presence <eos> When having you around just isn't so pleasant? <eos> Aquí nunca hay soledad <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan a encalmar <eos> I've seen somewhere in between <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan en soledad <eos> I think we both know, you've noticed it too <eos> It isn't just you and me alone in this room <eos> How can I forget your presence <eos> When having you around just isn't so pleasant? <eos> Aquí nunca hay soledad <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan a encalmar <eos> I've seen somewhere in between <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan en soledad <eos> Tu fantasma vive aquí <eos> Why'd it take so long for you to see? <eos> Aquí nunca hay soledad <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan a encalmar <eos> I've seen somewhere in between <eos> Mil fantasmas gritan en soledad <eos>

I’ve been told to be a seer, one must be ruthless <eos> So, I’ve eaten the yellow text of Paul and Brutus <eos> The soothsayers came and went, now I believe <eos> To be reborn, we first must cultivate a seed <eos> Oh, spit it out <eos> Release that precious piece <eos> Of pebbled ash from your mouth <eos> That’s a working-class jewel <eos> Spinning round your hopeless head <eos> It ain’t for chewing on <eos> It’s for looking through instead <eos> You prefer the common stone to the pearls <eos> Under the plexiglass with the factory girl <eos> Who told her sister all about you <eos> Hanging bedsheets on the clothesline in the sun <eos> She keep you warm, she keep you fed <eos> Now you’ve gone and lost your bed <eos> On the doorstep of the sick and indignant society <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who watched night disown day <eos> 35 days after defection <eos> I am sat in the cheapest of rooms <eos> There’s an oil lamp defiantly snapping at the shadows <eos> I’ve had notions to start playing chess <eos> But the mice, they have stolen the pieces <eos> I have told them to start paying rent or they must leave <eos> I am writing my letters <eos> I am anchored in an arm chair <eos> I intend on shooting the postman <eos> When he passes at dawn <eos> I haven’t eaten for 13 days <eos> I’ve taken the form of a Bosnian beggar <eos> And I’m reason the preachers are screaming and shouting <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> Tell their mother I’m home <eos> And as Christmas comes <eos> Send word to all the ones <eos> Who would love to be remembered <eos> By the ghosts of November <eos> On St. Stephens’s Day <eos> In some minuscule way <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> Across the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia <eos> I can’t get out now <eos> So here’s a postcard from Catalonia <eos>

When I was fourteen I was fallin' fast <eos> For a blue-eyed girl in my homeroom class <eos> Tryin to find the courage to ask her out <eos> Was like tryin' to get oil from a water spout <eos> What she would've said, I can't say <eos> I never did ask then she moved away <eos> I learned something from my blue-eyed girl <eos> Sink or swim, you gotta give it a whirl <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> The longer I live the more I believe <eos> You do have to give if you wanna receive <eos> There's a time to listen, a time to talk <eos> And you might have to crawl even after you walk <eos> Had sure things blow up in my face <eos> Seen the long-shot win the race <eos> Been knocked down by the slammin' door <eos> Picked myself up and came back for more <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow <eos> Don't worry 'bout what you don't know <eos> Life's a dance, you learn as you go <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Life's a dance <eos> Take a chance on love <eos> Life's a dance <eos> You learn as you go <eos> 
In the thundering rain <eos> You stare into my eyes <eos> I can feel your hand <eos> Moving up my thighs <eos> Skirt around my waist <eos> Wall against my face <eos> I can feel your lips, ooh <eos> I don't wanna stop just because <eos> People walking by are watching us <eos> I don't give a damn what they think <eos> I want you now <eos> I don't wanna stop just because <eos> You feel so good inside of my love <eos> I'm not gonna stop no, no, no <eos> I want you <eos> All I wanna say is <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around, mmm <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around, no, no, no, no, no <eos> Dancing on the floor <eos> Feeling the slow groove <eos> My mind is starting to burn <eos> With forbidden thoughts <eos> Strangers all around <eos> With the lights down low <eos> I was thinking maybe we could <eos> Well... you know <eos> I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop baby) <eos> People standing around are watching us (Standing around are watching us) <eos> I don't give a damn what they think (I don't give a damn) <eos> I want you now (I want you now) <eos> I don't wanna stop just because (I don't wanna stop) <eos> You feel so good inside of my love (Inside of my love) <eos> I'm not gonna stop no, no, no (No, no, no) <eos> I want you ((I want you now)) <eos> All I wanna say is <eos> Any time <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around (No, no, no, no, no, no, no) <eos> Any time baby <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around (Say it again, say it, oh yeah) <eos> Any time (Any time) <eos> And any place <eos> I don't care who's around <eos> Baby, baby <eos> I don't care who's around <eos> Any time baby <eos> Any place sugar <eos> They pass, they can stare I don't care who's around <eos> 
Don't wanna make a scene <eos> I really don't care if people stare at us <eos> Sometimes I think I'm dreamin' <eos> I pinch myself just to see if I'm awake or not (Oh) <eos> Is it real, what I feel? Could it be <eos> You and me 'til the end of time <eos> Never part, take my heart, hold it tight <eos> It's true love, you know I gotta be <eos> I gotta be the one you touch (Oh) <eos> Baby, I gotta be the one you love (I'm tellin' you that) <eos> I gotta be the one you feel <eos> And I gotta be the one to fill your life with sunshine <eos> I gotta be the one you know <eos> 'Cause I will always love you so (I'm lovin' you, girl) <eos> I gotta be the one you need <eos> I'm just tellin' you that I gotta be <eos> I picture you and me <eos> Startin' a life together, we could be <eos> We'll take this vow to love one another <eos> Make this thing a reality, ooh <eos> Is it real, what I feel?

The First Noel, the angels did say <eos> Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay <eos> In fields where they lay keeping their sheep <eos> On a cold winter's night that was so deep <eos> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel <eos> Born is the King of Israel <eos> They looked above and saw a star <eos> Shining in the east beyond them far <eos> And to the earth it gave great light <eos> And so it continued both day and night <eos> Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel <eos> Born is the King of Israel <eos> 
How can someone stand so damn close <eos> And feel like they're worlds away? <eos> I can see your sad story eyes <eos> So how do you have no words to say? <eos> All I want is to fall in deeper <eos> Than I've ever been <eos> Why won't you let me? <eos> I can handle your heart, so help me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright <eos> Through the dark for the both of us <eos> And "I've done it outta love" is not enough <eos> But God, how I wish it was <eos> And I don't wanna find out <eos> How much lonely I can take before you lose me <eos> Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos> I can't let it go <eos> From moments in your arms <eos> But they come back again <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves <eos> Here you are, next to me <eos> So much beauty at my feet <eos> All I wanna do is swim <eos> But the waves keep crashin' in <eos> No, I'm not afraid to drown <eos> Take me out, take me down <eos> I'm so tired of the shore <eos> Let me in, baby <eos> You're an ocean beautiful and blue <eos> I wanna swim in you <eos>

Tanto tiempo disfrutamos <eos> Este amor <eos> Nuestras almas se acercaron <eos> Tanto así <eos> Que yo guardo tu sabor <eos> Pero tú llevas también <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Si negaras mi presencia en tu vivir <eos> Bastaría con abrazarme y conversar <eos> Tanta vida yo te dí <eos> Que por fuerza llevas ya <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> No pretendo ser tu dueño <eos> No soy nada <eos> Yo no tengo vanidad <eos> De mi vida doy lo bueno <eos> Soy tan pobre que otra cosa puedo dar <eos> Pasarán más de mil años <eos> Muchos más <eos> Puedo hacer que tenga amor la inmensidad <eos> Pero allá tal como aquí <eos> En la boca llevarás <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> No pretendo ser tu dueño <eos> No soy nada <eos> Yo no tengo vanidad <eos> De mi vida doy lo bueno <eos> Soy tan pobre que otra cosa puedo dar <eos> Pasarán más de mil años <eos> Muchos más <eos> Puedo hacer que tenga amor la inmensidad <eos> Pero allá tal como aquí <eos> En la boca llevarás <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos> Sabor a mí <eos>

É pau, é pedra <eos> É o fim do caminho <eos> É um resto de toco <eos> É um pouco sozinho <eos> É um caco de vidro <eos> É a vida, é o sol <eos> É a noite, é a morte <eos> É o laço, é o anzol <eos> É peroba do campo <eos> É o nó da madeira <eos> Caingá, candeia <eos> É o Matita Pereira <eos> É madeira de vento <eos> Tombo da ribanceira <eos> É o mistério profundo <eos> É o queira ou não queira <eos> É o vento ventando <eos> É o fim da ladeira <eos> É a viga, é o vão <eos> Festa da cumeeira <eos> É a chuva chovendo <eos> É conversa ribeira <eos> Das águas de março <eos> É o fim da canseira <eos> É o pé, é o chão <eos> É a marcha estradeira <eos> Passarinho na mão <eos> Pedra de atiradeira <eos> É uma ave no céu <eos> É uma ave no chão <eos> É um regato <eos> É uma fonte <eos> É um pedaço de pão <eos> É o fundo do poço <eos> É o fim do caminho <eos> No rosto o desgosto <eos> É um pouco sozinho <eos> É um estrepe, é um prego <eos> É uma ponta, é um ponto <eos> É um pingo pingando <eos> É uma conta, é um conto <eos> É um peixe, é um gesto <eos> É uma prata brilhando <eos> É a luz da manhã <eos> É o tijolo chegando <eos> É a lenha, é o dia <eos> É o fim da picada <eos> É garrafa de cana <eos> O estilhaço na estrada <eos> É o projeto da casa <eos> É o corpo na cama <eos> É o carro enguiçado <eos> É a lama, é a lama <eos> É um passo <eos> É uma ponte <eos> É um sapo, é uma rã <eos> É um resto de mato <eos> Na luz da manhã <eos> São as águas de março fechando o verão <eos> É a promessa de vida no teu coração <eos> É uma cobra, é um pau <eos> É João, é José <eos> É um espinho na mão <eos> É um corte no pé <eos> São as águas de março fechando o verão <eos> É a promessa de vida no teu coração <eos> É pau, é pedra <eos> É o fim do caminho <eos> É um resto de toco <eos> É um pouco sozinho <eos> É um passo <eos> É uma ponte <eos> É um sapo, é uma rã <eos> É um belo horizonte <eos> É uma febre terçã <eos> São as águas de março fechando o verão <eos> É a promessa de vida no teu coração <eos> Au, edra, im, minho <eos> Esto, oco, ouco, inho <eos> Aco, idro, ida, ol, oite, orte, aço, zol <eos> São as águas de março fechando o verão <eos> É a promessa de vida no teu coração <eos> 
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart <eos> But to movin' on is the hardest part <eos> It comes in waves, the letting go <eos> But the memory fades, everybody knows <eos> Everybody knows <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Maybe months go by, maybe years from now <eos> And I meet someone and it's workin' out <eos> Every now and then, he can see right through <eos> 'Cause when I look at him <eos> Yeah, all I  see is you <eos> What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye? <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Ooh yeah <eos> What if I never get over? <eos> What if I never get closure? <eos> What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya? <eos> What if It never gets better? <eos> What if this lasts forever and ever and ever? <eos> I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes <eos> And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye <eos> And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got? <eos> What if your love was my one and only shot? <eos> What if I end up with nothing to compare it to <eos> What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> What if I never get over you? <eos> Oh, what if I never get over? <eos> Over you <eos> 
Many's the time I've been mistaken <eos> And many times confused <eos> Yes, and I've often felt forsaken <eos> And certainly misused <eos> Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right <eos> I'm just weary to my bones <eos> Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant <eos> So far away from home <eos> So far away from home <eos> I don't know a soul who's not been battered <eos> I don't have a friend who feels at ease <eos> I don't know a dream that's not been shattered <eos> Or driven to its knees <eos> Oh, but it's all right, it's all right <eos> For we've lived so well so long <eos> Still, when I think of the road we're traveling on <eos> I wonder what's gone wrong <eos> I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong <eos> And I dreamed I was dying <eos> I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly <eos> And looking back down at me, smiled reassuringly <eos> And I dreamed I was flying <eos> And high up above, my eyes could clearly see <eos> The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea <eos> And I dreamed I was flying <eos> We come on the ship they call the Mayflower <eos> We come on the ship that sailed the moon <eos> We come in the age's most uncertain hour <eos> And sing an American tune <eos> But it's all right, it's all right, all right <eos> You can't be forever blessed <eos> Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day <eos> And I'm trying to get some rest <eos> That's all I'm trying to get some rest <eos> 
We get some rules to follow <eos> That and this, these and those <eos> No one knows <eos> We get these pills to swallow <eos> How they stick in your throat <eos> Tastes like gold <eos> Oh, what you do to me <eos> No one knows <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> I journey through the desert <eos> Of the mind with no hope <eos> I follow <eos> I drift along the ocean <eos> Dead lifeboat in the sun <eos> End come undone <eos> Pleasantly caving in <eos> I come undone <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> Heaven smiles above me <eos> What a gift here below <eos> But no one knows <eos> A gift that you give to me <eos> No one knows <eos> Ustedes que son padres de familia... <eos> …Buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el <eos> "DJ Héctor Bonifacio Echevarría Cervantes de la Cruz Arroyo Rojas" <eos> Esta es la radio Quetzalcoatl <eos> Estación donde el rock vive y no muere <eos> Vamos a escuchar un par de temas de Queens of the Stone Age <eos> Primero vamos a escuchar "First It Giveth..." <eos> ...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… <eos>

Well, I don’t know what happens when we go <eos> But I hear that the streets are paved in gold <eos> And maybe there’s a little red dirt for my soul <eos> And maybe, just maybe the beer’s still cold <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> Well, I wonder if that light at the end is neon <eos> And I sure hope there’s a barstool for me to be on <eos> Give me Hank, give me Cash, give me Merle, give me Jones <eos> I know where I’m going when I’m home <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> Lord knows that’s where I’ll be <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> I hope it’s filled up with country songs <eos> I hope it’s got a dance floor <eos> So we can two-step to ‘em all night long <eos> I’ll keep ‘em rollin’ and rockin’ <eos> So them good times ain’t stopping for all of eternity <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> If Heaven’s got a jukebox <eos> That’s where I’ll be <eos> 
Like Elvis, like everyone <eos> We all die, we all live on in photos <eos> And paperbacks, if we're lucky <eos> We're coming back <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos> We notice <eos> We understand <eos> We throw out all we can <eos> We're on the market, we're up on racks <eos> If we're really lucky we're coming back <eos> I would never decide <eos> Mother Mary over, over <eos> Mother Mary over over me <eos>

Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She always has trouble <eos> Falling asleep <eos> And she likes to cuddle <eos> While under the sheets <eos> She loves pop songs <eos> And dancing, and bad trash TV <eos> There’s still a few other things <eos> She loves love notes and babies <eos> And likes giving gifts <eos> Has a hard time accepting <eos> A good compliment <eos> She loves hеr whole family <eos> And all of her friends <eos> So if you'rе the one she lets in <eos> Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart, don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> Kiss her with passion <eos> As much as you can <eos> Run your hands through her hair <eos> Whenever she’s sad <eos> And when she doesn’t notice <eos> How pretty she is <eos> Tell her over and over <eos> So she never forgets <eos> Take it <eos> If she gives you her heart, don't you break it <eos> Let your arms be a place she feels safe in <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> She’ll love you <eos> If you love her like that <eos> She’ll love you <eos> If you love her <eos> On days when <eos> It feels like the whole world might cave in <eos> Stand side by side and you’ll make it <eos> She’s the best thing that you'll ever have <eos> She’ll love you, if you love her like that <eos> 
As time passes, I feel so low <eos> Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole <eos> I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul <eos> I'll throw all of my cares away for you <eos> I'll be there to wait for you <eos> Maybe you weren't the one for me <eos> But deep down I wanted you to be <eos> I'll still see you in my dreams <eos> All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you <eos> So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting <eos> Through my emotion <eos> I will be coasting, roller-coasting <eos> I'm hoping that you'll come back to me <eos> Moving on seems harder to do <eos> When the one that you love moves faster than you <eos> I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies <eos> And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me <eos> As time passes I'm feeling high <eos> You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight <eos> I may not be over you, but I'll try inside <eos> I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh <eos> Coasting, roller-coasting <eos> In my emotions, oh <eos> I'll be coasting, roller-coasting <eos> I noticed you weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> Weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> So don't come back to me, no <eos> No, don't come back to me, no <eos> No, don't come back to me <eos> No, don't come back to me, no <eos> No, don't come back to me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> You weren't the one for me <eos> 
Hold me close and hold me fast <eos> The magic spell you cast <eos> This is "La vie en rose" <eos> When you kiss me, heaven sighs <eos> And though I close my eyes <eos> I see "La vie en rose" <eos> When you press me to your heart <eos> I'm in a world apart <eos> A world where roses bloom <eos> And when you speak, angels sing from above <eos> Everyday words seem to turn into love songs <eos> Give your heart and soul to me <eos> And life will always be <eos> "La vie en rose" <eos> 
I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> If you ask, just to show that I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> That it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> A return from unnatural vacation <eos> Left my mind and left my body vacant <eos> To remove from an old situation <eos> To where it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> So wait in the last place you lost me <eos> I aim to change, play the rules <eos> That I've wanted to break <eos> But refuse any longer <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> Just for you, I could show you I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> And never forget <eos> Never forget <eos> Never <eos> 
This time <eos> I'll wait, for the moment to dissipate <eos> With a new way, of viewing you <eos> Your walls are falling down <eos> This feeling has me within <eos> To start from the ground, <eos> and build again <eos> I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> You seem so, ready to pull close and let go <eos> You always let go <eos> This flame is burning out <eos> You're cold and I am within <eos> To light another match, <eos> and hope it sparks <eos> And I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> When everything we've built, burns to the ground <eos> And all the time we've spent, it seems wasted now <eos> It's an unusual feeling, that I still believe in <eos> And I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> No I can't keep from loving you <eos> And it's an unusual feeling, you used to believe in <eos> 
Money in my pocket <eos> But I just can't get no love <eos> Money in my pocket <eos> But I just can't get no love <eos> I'm praying for a girl to be my own <eos> Sonya said she's coming <eos> But I don't believe a word she says <eos> ‘Cause she run away and left me one rainy day <eos> She made me had in mind <eos> That her love would never die <eos> And now I'm alone, yeah, so alone <eos> So alone, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> Money in my pocket <eos> But I just can't get no love, oh no <eos> Money in my pocket <eos> But I just can't get no love <eos> The love I had in mind <eos> Was very, very hard to find, oh <eos> It's hard for a man to live without a woman (yeah) <eos> And a woman needs a man to cling to <eos> You see what love can do <eos> After making me feel blue <eos> Ain't that a shame?

(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> 
Yeah, go! <eos> Did you hear the one about me being a punk? <eos> Did you hear the one about me being a drunk? <eos> Did you hear the one about me losing my nerve? <eos> Or how I'm just another fuckin' sheep in the herd? <eos> Did you hear about the money, how it made me change? <eos> So funny to me, all the time that they waste <eos> Did you hear the one about me giving a shit? <eos> 'Cause if I ever did, I don't remember it <eos> You can be me and I will be you <eos> You can live just like a star <eos> I'll take my sanity; you take the fame <eos> I'm under it, over it all <eos> I'm under and over it <eos> Did you hear the one about me playing the game? <eos> Selling my soul and changing my name? <eos> Did you hear the one about me being a prick? <eos> Did you know I don't care, and you can suck my—? <eos> Did you hear the one about me trying to die? <eos> Fist in the air and a finger to the sky? <eos> Do I care if you hate me? Do you wanna know the truth? <eos> C'est la vie, adiós, good riddance, fuck you <eos> You can be me and I will be you <eos> You can live just like a star <eos> I'll take my sanity; you take the fame <eos> I'm under it, over it all <eos> I'm under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> You can be me and I will be you <eos> You can live just like a star <eos> I'll take my sanity; you take the fame <eos> I'm under it, over it all <eos> I'm under and over it <eos> I’m under it, over it all <eos> I’m under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> I—I—I'm under and over it <eos> 
Seasons change <eos> And I've tried hard just to soften you <eos> Seasons change <eos> But I've grown tired trying to change for you <eos> Cuz I've been waiting on you <eos> I've been waiting on you <eos> Cuz I've been waiting on you <eos> I've been weighing on you <eos> As it breaks, the summer will wake <eos> But the winter will wash what is left, of the taste <eos> As it breaks, the summer will warm <eos> But the winter will crave what has gone <eos> Will crave what has all <eos> Gone away <eos> People change <eos> But you know some people never do <eos> You know, when people change <eos> They gain a peace, but they lose one too <eos> Cuz I’ve been hanging on you <eos> I’ve been weighing on you <eos> Cuz I've been waiting on you <eos> I've been hanging on you <eos> As it breaks, the summer will wake <eos> But the winter will wash what is left, of the taste <eos> As it breaks, the summer will warm <eos> But the winter will crave what has gone <eos> Will crave what has all <eos> Gone away <eos> I've been waiting on you... <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos>

I fell by the wayside like everyone else <eos> I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself <eos> Our every moment, I start to replace <eos> 'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was never the right time, whenever you called <eos> Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all <eos> Our every moment, I start to replay <eos> But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face <eos> When you hurt under the surface <eos> Like troubled water running cold <eos> Well, time can heal but this won't <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> Would we be better off by now <eos> If I'd have let my walls come down? <eos> Maybe, I guess we'll never know <eos> You know, you know <eos> Before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make your heart beat better? <eos> If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather <eos> So, before you go <eos> Was there something I could've said <eos> To make it all stop hurting? <eos> It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless <eos> So, before you go <eos> 
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day <eos> When it's cold outside I've got the month of May <eos> Well, I guess you'd say <eos> What can make me feel this way? <eos> My girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> My Girl <eos> I've got so much honey the bees envy me <eos> I've got a sweeter song than the birds from the trees <eos> Well I guess you'd say <eos> What can make me feel this way? <eos> My girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> My girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> My girl <eos> I've got sunshine on a cloudy day <eos> When it's cold outside I've got the month of May <eos> Well, I guess you'd say <eos> What can make me feel this way? <eos> My girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> My Girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> Talkin' 'bout my girl <eos> My girl <eos> My girl <eos> Talin' 'bout my girl <eos> 
No hay mal que por bien no venga <eos> Por eso es que la extraña <eos> Ahora ella quiere que vuelva <eos> Pero yo ya me olvidé (Yeah) <eos> La vida me sale a cuenta <eos> Por fin me di cuenta que <eos> Podría tenerte cerca pero, eh <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien (Bien), sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero <eos> Te fuiste solito 'e mi casa <eos> No tengo nada que decirte <eos> Siempre dice' que algo te pasa <eos> Con eso ya me aburriste <eos> Podría escribirte pero te borré del celular <eos> Ya viste que me solté el pelo <eos> No voy a disimular que voy bien <eos> Que estar sin ti me gusta <eos> Tu enojo no me asusta <eos> Sé que no fui injusta, papá <eos> Sabes que no tengo la culpa <eos> Por eso ahora me buscas <eos> Es demasiado tarde para perdonar <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien, sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero (Yeah) <eos> A ti te tocó perder <eos> De tanto que sí, que no <eos> Volvió a llamar otra vez <eos> Pero esta vez se acabó <eos> Yo sé que no hay dos sin tres <eos> Y tú ya fallaste dos (Dos) <eos> Qué fácil pedir perdón <eos> Qué fácil pedir perdón, oye <eos> Ahora esta vida me tiene loco <eos> Viviendo arriba como un piloto <eos> Y ahora que pienso en lo de antes, no quiero ni verte porque to' me sabe a poco, yeh (¡No, no!) <eos> Se vive bien sin saber de nadie <eos> Se vive bien sin saber del otro <eos> Y si me ves por la calle no me hables, ni pidas, ya no hay nada entre nosotros, baby, porque <eos> Esta vida sienta bien sin ti (Sin ti) <eos> Ahora me lloras (Uh, yeah) <eos> Lo siento, pero <eos> Esta vida sienta bien, sin ti <eos> No se perdona a un traicionero <eos> ¿Para qué si tú me traicionas, nene? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos> ¿Para qué jugás conmigo? <eos>

There was a time <eos> When I was so broken hearted <eos> Love wasn't much of a friend of mine <eos> The tables have turned, yeah <eos> 'Cause me and them ways have parted <eos> That kind of love was the killin' kind <eos> Now listen <eos> All I want is someone I can't resist <eos> I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm trying to forget you <eos> Love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dying 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do down on me <eos> Now there's not even breathing room <eos> Between pleasure and pain <eos> Yeah, you cry when we're making love <eos> Must be one and the same <eos> It's down on me <eos> Yeah I got to tell you one thing <eos> It's been on my mind <eos> Girl, I gotta say <eos> We're partners in crime <eos> You got that certain something <eos> What you give to me <eos> Takes my breath away <eos> Now the word out on the street <eos> Is the devil's in your kiss <eos> If our love goes up in flames <eos> It's a fire I can't resist <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm trying to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dying 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do to me <eos> 'Cause what you got inside <eos> Ain't where your love should stay <eos> Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love <eos> 'Til you give your heart away <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm tryin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' just to get you <eos> Now I'm dyin' to let you <eos> Do what you do what you do down to me <eos> Baby, baby, baby <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm tryin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet misery <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you <eos> Do what you do down to , down to, down to, down to <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> Now I'm dyin' to forget you <eos> Your love is sweet <eos> I was cryin' when I met you <eos> 
I've been sittin' here, tryna write a pop song <eos> Tryna follow up that viral shit that popped off <eos> Wrackin' my brain <eos> Like, "What can I say?" <eos> I'm just tryna recreate what I did the first time <eos> Is any topic even worthy of a first line? <eos> Been here all night <eos> I think I might cry <eos> I didn't mean to come out (Come out, come out) <eos> But then my girl walked in (Walked in, walked in) <eos> And I figured out what I'm writin' <eos> What's more beautiful than a woman? Nothin' <eos> Ain't no fuckin' vibe like a woman's lovin' <eos> No drug gon' get you high like <eos> Grabbin' her hips, workin' your way up and down her <eos> Every inch, kissin' on the kitchen counter <eos> Change my mind <eos> What's more beautiful than a woman? <eos> Woman, woman, woman <eos> Woman, woman, woman <eos> Woman, woman, woman <eos> Babe, I really gotta thank you that you came through <eos> You a baddie, make me happy, you're my main muse <eos> Lucky me <eos> You're a masterpiece <eos> I didn't mean to come out (Come out, come out) <eos> But then my girl walked in (Walked in, walked in) <eos> And I figured out what I'm writin' <eos> What's more beautiful than a woman?

Even when I'm right I'm wrong again <eos> Even in the light the shadows win <eos> I know what it takes for you to win the war <eos> Cursing at the face that stares behind the door <eos> Living proof <eos> You'll do what's best for you <eos> Taken all I am for granted <eos> Waken to a dream abandoned <eos> The more we play the part <eos> Will you let me fall apart <eos> Even now I know you still deceive <eos> Even now I try to make believe <eos> Can you be the one that I am looking for <eos> Hell is waiting patiently behind the door <eos> Living proof <eos> You'll do what's best for you <eos> Taken all I am for grantеd <eos> Waken to a dream abandoned <eos> Thе more we play the part <eos> Will you let me fall apart <eos> You don't even know me <eos> Is there nothing sacred <eos> Nothing sacred at all <eos> You don't even know me <eos> (Will you let me fall apart) <eos> Taken all I am for granted <eos> Waken to a dream abandoned <eos> The more we play the part <eos> Will you let me fall apart <eos> (You don't even know me) <eos>

The scent that you left on my pillow <eos> The sound of your heartbeat with mine <eos> The look in your eyes like a window <eos> The taste of your kiss soaked in wine <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> Guess you forgot what you told me <eos> Because you left my heart on the floor <eos> Baby, your ghost still haunts me <eos> But I don't want to sleep with him no more <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Of every little thing <eos> They say time is the only healer <eos> God, I hope that isn't right <eos> Cause right now I'd die to not remember <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Every little thing <eos> I remember every little thing <eos> I'm haunted by the memories of <eos> Every little thing <eos> The high, the hurt, the shine, the sting <eos> Every little thing <eos>

When you were here before <eos> Couldn't look you in the eye <eos> You're just like an angel <eos> Your skin makes me cry <eos> You float like a feather <eos> In a beautiful world <eos> I wish I was special <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I don't care if it hurts <eos> I wanna have control <eos> I want a perfect body <eos> I want a perfect soul <eos> I want you to notice <eos> When I'm not around <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> I wish I was special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> Oh, oh <eos> She's running out the door <eos> She's running out <eos> She run, run, run, run <eos> Run <eos> Whatever makes you happy <eos> Whatever you want <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> I wish I was special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I don't belong here <eos> 
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack frost nipping at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that santa's on his way - <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so i'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to ninety-two <eos> Although its been said many times <eos> Many ways: "merry christmas to you" <eos> 
Mmm-mm-mm <eos> Tú siempre decías que nunca te irías sino que iría bien <eos> No luchar por lo que quieres sólo tiene un nombre y se llama perder <eos> Si te hice daño no fue sin quererte sino sin querer <eos> Dime sólo qué prefieres si tienes la opción de tener o temer <eos> Mmm-mm-mm <eos> Tú sólo piensas en cómo se acaba <eos> Yo sólo pienso en cómo acabaré <eos> Un día me dices "Me faltan las ganas" <eos> Otro lo pienso y nunca te gané <eos> Yo que hice todo porque te quedaras (Uuh, uuh) <eos> Ahora lo pienso y con qué me quedé (Uuh, uuh) <eos> Tiempo perdido, quizás lo he ganado (Uuh, uuh) <eos> De echarte de menos a decirte que <eos> Lo siento, por hacerte perder el tiempo <eos> Por pensar que hacer otro intento <eos> Por tenerte, lucharte y sentirte te haría feliz <eos> Reviento, porque a veces ni yo me entiendo <eos> Cómo voy a entender lo nuestro <eos> Si nunca te entendí ni a ti <eos> Yo sé que en importarme el pasado <eos> Que antes me mataba sólo es crecer <eos> Que nunca hemos sido dos <eos> Ya que contando el miedo éramos tres <eos> Porque somos tan iguales que si yo me voy tú te vas también <eos> El fallo es tener un problema y nunca aprender <eos> Si voy a quedarme que sea contigo <eos> Si voy a correr que sea por el filo <eos> Sé que el futuro no estaba delante <eos> Ahora sí me doy cuenta que me castigo <eos> Ya gané al tiempo y no está perdido <eos> Yo nunca recuerdo, pero no olvido <eos> Existen más cartas que nunca se dieron <eos> Porque ya no hay fuerza' por quien la ha escrito <eos> Lo siento, por hacerte perder el tiempo <eos> Por pensar que hacer otro intento <eos> Por tenerte, lucharte y sentirte te haría feliz <eos> Ay, reviento, porque a veces ni yo me entiendo <eos> Cómo voy a entender lo nuestro <eos> Si nunca te entendí ni a ti <eos> Porque tus aciertos dirán donde estás <eos> Y tus fallos tan sólo por donde ir <eos> De qué me vale la cantidad <eos> Si sólo la intensidad va a hacerme feliz <eos> Antes de hacer lo que va destrozarnos <eos> Prefiero salvarme y hacerme a mí <eos> Ahora comprendo que no puedes darme aquello que no tienes ni vive en ti <eos> Lo siento, por hacerte perder el tiempo <eos> Por pensar que hacer otro intento <eos> Por tenerte, lucharte y sentirte te haría feliz <eos> Yo reviento, porque a veces ni yo me entiendo <eos> Cómo voy a entender lo nuestro <eos> Si nunca te entendí ni a ti <eos> Tú siempre decías que nunca te irías sino que iría bien <eos> No luchar por lo que quieres sólo tiene un nombre y se llama perder <eos> Si te hice daño no fue sin quererte sino sin querer <eos> Dime sólo qué prefieres, si tienes la opción de tener o temer <eos> 
Pierdo y quemo todo lo que fue <eos> Me derrite y se siente tan bien <eos> Siento, siento todo en movimiento <eos> Psilocibina en mi cuerpo <eos> El sonido cambia de color <eos> Ya se fue <eos> El sonido de mi voz <eos> Vibración <eos> Infinita del amor <eos> Derrumbe <eos> Dosis que me hace entender <eos> Puede ser <eos> Que con esto me encontré <eos> Tal vez no pude asimilarlo <eos> (El sonido, derrumbe, derrumbе) oh yeah, hey <eos> Pero mi mеnte no soy yo <eos> Ya se fue <eos> El sonido de mi voz <eos> Vibración <eos> Infinita del amor <eos> Derrumbe <eos> Dosis que me hace entender <eos> Puede ser <eos> Que con esto me encontré <eos> Ya se fue <eos> El sonido de mi voz <eos> Vibración <eos> Infinita del amor <eos> Derrumbe <eos> Dosis que me hace entender <eos> Puede ser <eos> Que con esto me encontré <eos> Taranananana <eos>

Caught in my mind, I'm just a misfit <eos> Leave me to die, the world can't fix it <eos> Thought I was fine, but I'm sick <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one will help you now <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now, safe now <eos> Caught in a brilliant state of mind, I <eos> Thought I was sick, but I am fine, I lied <eos> Thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos> We'll torch every street and watch the whole Earth fry <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Fear not, my dear, liberate the Earth <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> I thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos> 
(Verse 1:  David Frizzell) <eos> There's a full moon over Tulsa <eos> I hope that it's shining on you <eos> The nights are getting cold <eos> In Cherokee County <eos> There's a Blue Norther passing through <eos> I remember green eyes and a rancher's daughter <eos> But remember is all that I do <eos> Losing you left a pretty good cowboy <eos> With nothing to hold on to <eos> Sundown came and I drove to town <eos> And drank a drink or two <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 2:  Shelly West) <eos> Here the city lights outshine the moon <eos> I was just now thinking of you <eos> Sometimes when the wind blows you can <eos> See the mountains <eos> And all the way to Malibu <eos> Everyone's a star here in L.A. County <eos> You ought to see the things that they do <eos> All the cowboys down on the Sunset Strip <eos> Wish that they could be like you <eos> The Santa Monica Freeway <eos> Sometimes makes a country girl blue <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> (Verse 3:  Both) <eos> I work 10 hours on a John Deere tractor <eos> Just thinking of you all day <eos> I've got a calico cat and a two-room flat <eos> On a street in West L.A <eos> (Chorus) <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> You're the reason God made Oklahoma <eos> And I'm sure missing you <eos> I'm sure missing you <eos> 

Christmas time is here <eos> Happiness and cheer <eos> Fun for all that children call their favorite time of year <eos> Snowflakes in the air <eos> Carols everywhere <eos> Olden times and ancient rhymes and love and dreams to share <eos> Sleigh bells in the air; <eos> Beauty every where; <eos> Yuletide by the fireside <eos> And joyful memories there <eos> Christmas time is here; <eos> Families drwing near; <eos> Oh that we could always see such spirit through the year <eos>

They say "Love is more precious than gold" <eos> Can't be bought and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> I got a woman with eyes that shine <eos> Down deep, as a diamond mine <eos> She's my treasure, so very rare <eos> She made me a millionaire <eos> When we ride around, ride around this old town <eos> In my beat-up car, with the windows down <eos> People look at her and they look at me <eos> And say "That boy is sure livin' in luxury" <eos> Sweet luxury <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought no, never could be sold <eos> I got love, enough to share <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> When the kisses fall from everywhere <eos> Like riches on a millionaire <eos> When my pockets are empty and the cupboard is bare <eos> I still feel like a millionaire <eos> 'Cause love is more precious than gold <eos> It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold <eos> I got love, enough to spare <eos> That makes me a millionaire <eos> 
Lights go down, wheels go 'round <eos> I'm taking you home <eos> Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now <eos> I'm not ready to shut it down <eos> The way the dashboard glow <eos> Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind <eos> And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot <eos> Stop this car and throw it in park and just <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> (Slow dance in a parking lot) <eos> A half song gone, one door open, across the lot <eos> A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car <eos> Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time <eos> To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks <eos> You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman" <eos> And I don't care what song comes next <eos> I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a <eos> Slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos> And get close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just <eos> A slow dance with you <eos> Spinning you around by the Walmart sign <eos> And moving our feet over the painted white lines <eos> Getting close to you <eos> Making the most of whatever we got <eos> Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot <eos>

Mary took to running with a travelling man <eos> Left her momma crying with her head in her hands <eos> Such a sad case, so broken hearted <eos> She say, momma, gotta go, gotta get outta here <eos> Gotta get outta town, tired of hanging around <eos> I gotta roll on between the ditches <eos> Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go <eos> 'Round and around, nobody knows <eos> But the highway goes on forever <eos> That ol' highway rolls on forever <eos> Lord, she never would’ve done it if she hadn't got drunk <eos> If she hadn't started running with a travelling man <eos> If she hadn't started taking those crazy chances <eos> She say, daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelling' kind <eos> Everywhere he's goin' such a very short time <eos> He'll be long gone before you know it <eos> He'll be long gone before you know it <eos> She say, never have I known it when it felt so good <eos> Never have I knew it when I knew I could <eos> Never have I done it when it looked so right <eos> Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight <eos> This is down in the swampland, anything goes <eos> It's alligator bait and the bars don't close <eos> It's the real thing down in Louisiana <eos> Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad <eos> When he really got trouble like a daughter goin’ bad <eos> It gets real hot down in Louisiana <eos> The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed <eos> He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will <eos> It ain't no time for lengthy speeches <eos> There ain't no time for lengthy speeches <eos> Just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go <eos> 'Round and around nobody knows <eos> But the highway goes on forever <eos> That old highway rolls on forever <eos>

You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos>

As I undressed in my apartment, empty-hearted <eos> Did you remember how we made it without a sound? <eos> And with all the vapor that you brought in <eos> And you never even let me hit the ground <eos> You still never make a sound in the air <eos> But you never made a downpour in the sky <eos> And the window clears as my tears pouring down <eos> We could never rain as one on empty houses <eos> It would downpour back to town with deafening sound <eos> It would clean the insides inside-out <eos> You never made a cloud float in the air <eos> But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile <eos> The time you put has made a wound <eos> It's just a wound it leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos> You'll never know what's happening <eos> It leaves a wound he leaves behind <eos>

I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I see a line of cars and they're all painted black <eos> With flowers and my love, both never to come back <eos> I see people turn their heads and quickly look away <eos> Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day <eos> I look inside myself and see my heart is black <eos> I see my red door, I must have it painted black <eos> Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts <eos> It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black <eos> No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue <eos> I could not foresee this thing happening to you <eos> If I look hard enough into the setting sun <eos> My love will laugh with me before the morning comes <eos> I see a red door and I want it painted black <eos> No colours anymore, I want them to turn black <eos> I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes <eos> I have to turn my head until my darkness goes <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted black <eos> Black as night, black as coal <eos> I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky <eos> I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black <eos> Yeah <eos> 
Heart beats fast <eos> Colors and promises <eos> How to be brave <eos> How can I love when I'm afraid to fall? <eos> But watching you stand alone <eos> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> Time stands still <eos> Beauty in all she is <eos> I will be brave <eos> I will not let anything take away <eos> What's standing in front of me <eos> Every breath <eos> Every hour has come to this <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> One step closer <eos> One step closer <eos> I have died every day waiting for you <eos> Darling, don't be afraid <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> And all along I believed I would find you <eos> Time has brought your heart to me <eos> I have loved you for a thousand years <eos> I'll love you for a thousand more <eos> 
You may think that I'm talking foolish <eos> You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free <eos> You may wonder how I can promise you now <eos> This love that I feel for you, always will be <eos> But you're not just time that I'm killing <eos> I'm no longer one of those guys <eos> As sure as I live, this love that I give <eos> Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen​ <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> I'll be happy to tell you again <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> They say that time takes its toll on a body <eos> Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey <eos> But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair <eos> And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway <eos> They say that time can play tricks on a memory <eos> Make people forget things they knew <eos> Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me <eos> I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling <eos> I'm gonna love you forever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> As long as old men sit and talk about the weather <eos> As long as old women sit and talk about old men <eos> If you wonder how long I'll be faithful <eos> Well, just listen to how this song ends <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos> I'm gonna love you forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, forever and ever <eos> Forever and ever, Amen <eos>

Si me dieran a elegir una vez más <eos> Te eligiría sin pensarlo <eos> Es que no hay nada que pensar <eos> Que no existe ni motivo, ni razón <eos> Para dudarlo ni un segundo <eos> Porque tú has sido lo mejor <eos> Que tocó este corazón <eos> Y que entre el cielo y tú <eos> Yo me quedo contigo <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> Si esto no es querer entonces dime tú lo que será <eos> Si necesito de tus besos pa' que pueda respirar <eos> Y de tus ojos que van regalando vida <eos> Y que me dejan sin salida <eos> ¿Y para qué quiero salir? <eos> Si nunca he sido tan feliz <eos> Que te prefiero más que nada en este mundo <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> (Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo) <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¡Oh! ¿Y es que no ves <eos> Que toda mi vida tan sólo depende de ti? <eos> Yeh-he <eos> Si te he dado todo lo que tengo <eos> (Si te he dado todo lo que tengo) <eos> Hasta quedar en deuda conmigo mismo <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo <eos> (Si no hay un minuto de mi tiempo) <eos> Que no me pasas por el pensamiento <eos> Y todavía preguntas si te quiero <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> ¿Tú de qué vas? <eos> 
Home now, end of the night <eos> It's colder to turn on your side <eos> And I know you're up in two hours <eos> But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow <eos> So don't ruin now <eos> How we gonna move together? Just come closer <eos> If we don't move together, just come closer <eos> How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together? <eos> Just keeping the peace between the sheets <eos> And I creep in, and everything's loud <eos> I'm sorry, I've woken you now <eos> And we'll argue the tiniest thing <eos> But we didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow <eos> So I'm done whispering, done whispering <eos> How we gonna move together? Just come closer <eos> If we don't move together, just come closer <eos> How we gonna breathe?

Just come closer <eos> If we don't move together, come closer <eos> How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together? <eos> Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace <eos> Just keeping the peace between these sheets <eos>

In this hole that is me <eos> The dead are rolling over <eos> In this hole, thickening <eos> Dirt shoveled over shoulders <eos> I feel it in me, so overwhelmed <eos> Oh, this pressured center rising <eos> My life overturned, unfair the despair <eos> All these scars keep ripping open <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> In this hole that is me <eos> A life that's growing feeble <eos> In this hole, so limiting <eos> The sun has set, all darkens <eos> Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel <eos> Internal path-way to contention <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Are you happy? <eos> Are you happy? <eos> Are you feeling <eos> Happy? <eos> In this hole that is me <eos> Left with a heart exhausted <eos> What's my release? What sets me free? <eos> Do you pull me up just to push me down again? <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear meat from the bone <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Peel me from the skin <eos> (Peel me from the skin) <eos> Tear me from the rind <eos> Does it make you happy now? <eos> Tear me from the bone <eos> (Tear me from the bone) <eos> Tear me from myself <eos> Are you feeling happy now? <eos> Does it make you happy? <eos> Are you feeling happy <eos> Are you fucking happy <eos> Now that I'm lost, left with nothing? <eos> Does it make you happy? <eos> Are you feeling happy? <eos> Are you fucking happy <eos> Now that I'm lost, left with nothing? <eos>

Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> My baby beside me at the wheel <eos> I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile <eos> My curiosity runnin' wild <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> Ridin' along in my automobile <eos> I's anxious to tell her the way I feel <eos> So I told her softly and sincere <eos> And she leaned and whispered in my ear <eos> Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> No particular place to go <eos> So we parked way out on the kokomo <eos> The night was young and the moon was bold <eos> So we both decided to take a stroll <eos> Can you imagine the way I felt? <eos> I couldn't unfasten her safety belt <eos> Ridin' along in my calaboose <eos> Still tryin' to get her belt aloose <eos> All the way home I held a grudge <eos> But the safety belt it wouldn't budge <eos> Cruisin' and playin' the radio <eos> With no particular place to go <eos> 
I get lonely even if I never say it <eos> I hate the silence I need someone else to break it <eos> I don't think that I would fare too well in Vegas <eos> I'm feeling lucky so I ask you how your day is <eos> I say some crazy shit and then I walk it back <eos> "The clothes you'll die in hanging on your rack" <eos> Don't know what I meant to you by saying that <eos> But now you're crying, so <eos> Don't kiss me I have a cold <eos> It's New Years Eve and I feel old <eos> Don't hold my hand, I broke my thumb <eos> It's Valentines Day and I feel numb <eos> Stay the hell away from me <eos> 'Cause I'm staying home on Halloween <eos> I've got a real short wish list <eos> I just wanna be alone for Christmas <eos> I can't pick up all the things that fall out my mouth <eos> Don't know why I say 'em, maybe I think too loud <eos> Really wish I could ask you where you are now <eos> But I've got some sense of boundaries <eos> Everybody thinks they're so goddamn unique <eos> For looking for somebody who hates the same thing <eos> I say I hate myself but what I really mean <eos> Is that I hate that you're not enough for me <eos> Don't kiss me I have a cold <eos> It's New Years Eve and I feel old <eos> Don't hold my hand, I broke my thumb <eos> It's Valentines Day and I feel numb <eos> Stay the hell away from me <eos> 'Cause I'm staying home on Halloween <eos> I've got a real short wish list <eos> I just wanna be alone for Christmas <eos> 
Is it just me? <eos> Or did we <eos> Do this this the last time we said it’s the last time <eos> I’d be lying <eos> If I said I been <eos> Moving on like I thought I’d be <eos> I know it’s wrong but it’s how I feel <eos> Already know it’s a bad idea <eos> I should take my own advice <eos> But I, I still think about you baby <eos> I wish you didn’t feel so right <eos> I really wanna tell you I don’t miss you and really mean <eos> I just can’t though I want to it <eos> But I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Take back goodbye <eos> Say I changed my mind <eos> Been there before but <eos> I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Call you tonight <eos> It’s almost like <eos> I miss you more when I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Yeah I’m tryin’ not to <eos> I don’t want to <eos> But I still want you <eos> It’s so perfect <eos> It gets on my nerves yeah <eos> I tried so hard, ain’t getting me far <eos> Pushing away just brings you even closer to me <eos> Yeah I still think about you baby <eos> I wish you didn’t feel so right <eos> I really wanna tell you I don’t miss you and really mean it <eos> I just can’t though I want to it <eos> But I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Take back goodbye <eos> Say I changed my mind <eos> Been there before but <eos> I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Call you tonight <eos> It’s almost like <eos> I miss you more when I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Yeah I’m tryin’ not to <eos> Maybe we could get it right this time <eos> Or maybe I'm just lying to myself <eos> But I’m trying not to <eos> 
You say that you really love me <eos> I'm always on your mind <eos> And you say I should be your lover <eos> And we should spend some time <eos> But I'm not persuaded that quickly <eos> My heart has been broken before you see <eos> So if you want to be my lover <eos> You have to prove your love is true to me <eos> Cause it's easy <eos> To tell me you love me <eos> Easy to say <eos> You're thinking of me <eos> Words are so easy to say <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Actions speak louder than words <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> Cause all those lies I've already heard <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Let me believe that it's true <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> And I'll get together with you <eos> You say that there is no other <eos> I am the only one <eos> And you say that if we were lovers <eos> We would have so much fun <eos> But my mother warned me <eos> That I should beware of young boys <eos> Saying things that you say <eos> So I must be sure that <eos> If I give you my love <eos> You won't take it then run away <eos> Cause it's easy <eos> To tell me you love me <eos> Easy to say <eos> You're thinking of me <eos> Words are so easy to say <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Actions speak louder than words <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> Cause all those lies I've already heard <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Let me believe that it's true <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> And I'll get together with you <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Actions speak louder than words <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> Cause all those lies I've already heard <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really love me <eos> Let me believe that it's true <eos> Show me, show me <eos> You really need me <eos> And I'll get together with you <eos>

Drawing our names after hours <eos> What is it about me that I can't find peace? <eos> Traces of flowers from Traverse <eos> Kept your letters in a box, should I even bother? <eos> Here's the truth <eos> I'll always go back to you <eos> No one ever told me <eos> You would leave me <eos> Leave me here so lonely <eos> Lonely <eos> Playing with snow like little kids <eos> Laughing 'til we were crying, I'd hurt my ribs <eos> Winter was heavy, wasn't it? <eos> I distracted with a song <eos> But I won't admit it's about you <eos> It's always about you <eos> 'Bout you <eos> Here's the truth <eos> I'll always go back to you <eos> No one ever told me <eos> You would leave me <eos> Leave me here so lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely <eos> Lonely <eos> February, March, what's the catch? <eos> It's been dragging us through the water to face the fact <eos> That I'm leaving on Sunday at 2 PM <eos> And I might never see you laughing again <eos> I'll always go back to you <eos> No one ever told me <eos> You would leave me <eos> Leave me here so lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely <eos> Lonely, lonely <eos>

Digamos, que te creo <eos> Que te arrepientes <eos> Pero es diferente a que te perdone <eos> Seré buena gente, pero no tu pendejo <eos> Yo no me dejo <eos> Y yo sé que te van a dar ganas de <eos> Besar mi boca una vez más <eos> Pero por tu culpa, ¿sabes cuándo va a pasar? <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Vuelves a dormir conmigo <eos> Yo en cualquier esquina me hallo una de tu tipo <eos> Tú que encuentres otro igual, eso sí va a estar canijo <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Me dirijas la palabra <eos> Me caen en la punta las personas que son falsas <eos> No te pongas a llorar, déjate de payasadas <eos> Tú ya me perdiste, lo mejor es que te vayas <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Vuelves a dormir conmigo <eos> Yo en cualquier esquina me hallo una de tu tipo <eos> Tú que encuentres otro igual, eso sí va a estar canijo <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Me dirijas la palabra <eos> Me caen en la punta las personas que son falsas <eos> No te pongas a llorar, déjate de payasadas <eos> Tú ya me perdiste, lo mejor es que te vayas <eos>

L'amour, l'amour, l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> À l'amour, c'est un printemps craintif <eos> Une lumière attendrie, ou souvent une ruine <eos> L'amour, l'amour, c'est le poivre du temps <eos> Une rafale de vent, une feuillée de lune <eos> L'amour, l'amour, à l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> L'amour, mais la nuit a un bonnet <eos> Et le jour porte un masque <eos> Qui veulent que l'on grimace <eos> L'amour, l'amour <eos> C'est parfois même aussi, que le visage d'un autre <eos> Qui n'est ni lui ni l'autre <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour, à l'amour <eos> Dont on parle toujours <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour c'est plus d'une fois <eos> Un panier vide aux bras l'arc-en-ciel sur deux coeurs <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour <eos> À l'amour c'est quand je t'aime <eos> À l'amour c'est quand tu m'aimes <eos> Sans me le dire <eos> Sans te le dire <eos> À l'amour, à l'amour <eos> L'amour c'est quand tu m'aimes <eos> L'amour c'est quand je t'aime <eos> Sans te le dire <eos> Sans me le dire <eos> 
Take it, I don't need it (I don't need it) <eos> I don't wanna hear your motherfuckin' side <eos> You can love it (You can love it) <eos> Or you can leave it (Or you can leave it) <eos> Because nothing I say and nothing I feel is right <eos> Even if you wanted to, you couldn't understand <eos> While I'm sitting up here dying, you're just holding out your hand <eos> And even if I wanted to, I couldn't have explained <eos> 'Cause you don't know the difference between violence and pain <eos> There's no denying it, you've never had control <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> I'm not a dog (I'm not a dog), I'm not a slave (I'm not a slave) <eos> It doesn't matter how much money I get paid <eos> I give a shit (I give a shit), I never did (I never did) <eos> So you can wipe it away, that silly fuckin' grin <eos> If I wrote it down for you, could you ever see it clear? <eos> Or would it go straight through your soul and come right out your ear? <eos> If I slowed it down for you, would you think me insincere? <eos> 'Cause in the end, I'll never bend, I'll never shed a tear <eos> There's no denying it, I've always had control <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> (Inside out) <eos> How you've turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> How you've turned me inside out <eos> I'm inside out <eos> So inside out <eos> I stand alone <eos> Guess I knew it all along <eos> Yes, I knew that you were wrong <eos> How you left when I was down <eos> I want you to say <eos> It was never really me <eos> You just turned and walked away <eos> How you turned me inside out <eos> Inside out <eos> Inside out <eos>

Sitting at the stoplight <eos> He can't be bothered by the heart cry <eos> Written on the cardboard in her hand <eos> But when she looks him in the eye <eos> His heart is broken open wide <eos> And he feels the hand of God reach out through him <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus, help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> There's silence at the table <eos> He wants to talk, but he's not able <eos> For all the shame that's locked him deep inside <eos> But her words are the medicine <eos> When she says they can begin again <eos> And forgiveness will set him free tonight <eos> As Heaven touches earth <eos> God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> I said, God put a million, million doors in the world <eos> For his love to walk through <eos> One of those doors is you <eos> Oh, we bring the Kingdom come <eos> Oh, with every act of love <eos> Jesus help us carry You <eos> Alive in us, Your light shines through <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos> With every act of love <eos> We bring the Kingdom come <eos>

Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And the cares that hung around me through the week <eos> Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak <eos> When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to climb a mountain <eos> And reach the highest peak <eos> But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to go out fishing <eos> In a river or a creek <eos> But I don't enjoy it half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Now Mamma Dance with me <eos> I want my arm(s) about you <eos> That (Those) charm(s) about you <eos> Will carry me through... <eos> (Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging) <eos> Out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos>

A complicated sunset <eos> Sets the mood within the room <eos> All bets are up and <eos> We keep looking down <eos> To try and find <eos> The will to turn this around <eos> I spent the last three months <eos> In mental traction <eos> Woeing all I could forsee <eos> I slept myself free and <eos> Cursed at all awake <eos> The medicine I'd take <eos> I broke down <eos> On the train to southtown <eos> Midway inbound <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> I held out <eos> Carrying this crutch around <eos> Angry words came rushing out <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> Now I could pound on the keys so hard and <eos> Make the mallets slap the strings and <eos> Pump the pedals till I'm breathless and <eos> Sing off key and <eos> Wouldn't that be just like me? <eos> Now people in the back yell hey <eos> When they see me today <eos> I got a smile so wide it stems offstage <eos> They say go go you gone soul and <eos> For all I know <eos> They now know <eos> Oh no <eos> You broke down <eos> As I tore the pages out <eos> During all the painful parts <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> You held out <eos> Carrying your diary around <eos> Angry ink came rushing out <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> So we finished the night and <eos> We laud the long ride <eos> Because it leads to my own bed <eos> So at least tonight <eos> My head will be alright <eos> We broke down <eos> Miles out of Morgantown <eos> A midnight rainstorm crashing down <eos> Not one breathing soul around <eos> Eleven to your seven <eos> 
What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> What is more beautiful tonight <eos> And bluer than the sky <eos> I had to climb <eos> Higher and higher <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone? <eos> Are you alone now? <eos> Are you? <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until I fall <eos> Until I fall, until <eos> 
I looking for the star right now <eos> I wonder where you are right now <eos> (wait a minute) <eos> We three kings of Orient are <eos> Bearing gifts we traverse afar <eos> Field and fountain, moor and mountain <eos> Following yonder star <eos> (whoo) <eos> (yah) <eos> (stars) <eos> Born a king on Bethlehem’s plain, (Bethlehem’s) <eos> Gold I bring to crown Him again, (you are) <eos> King forever, ceasing never <eos> Over us all to reign <eos> Star of wonderful, you light of the night <eos> Star of royal and your beauty is bright <eos> Westward leading, still proceeding <eos> Guide us to the Light <eos> (We won’t stop) <eos> We won’t stop until we see the light <eos> I wonder where find the light <eos> Everything for everyday <eos> To find a light that will save your day <eos> To the storm (?) <eos> No matter how long takes <eos> Star of wonderful, you light of the night <eos> Star of royal and your beauty is bright <eos> Westward leading, still proceeding <eos> Guide us to the Light <eos> (We won’t stop) <eos> We won’t stop until we see the light <eos> I feel so cold <eos> We need a new heart <eos> For over broken soul’s <eos> We know what we need <eos> We need a love (I love song) <eos> (?) (for the whole world) <eos> From the day come (Good morning comes) <eos> What will it bring (tell me) <eos> Tell me what will it brings <eos> I’m looking for the star right now <eos> I wonder where you are right now <eos> I’m looking for the star right now <eos> I wonder where you are right now <eos> Star of wonderful, you light of the night <eos> Star of royal and your beauty is bright <eos> Westward leading, still proceeding <eos> Guide us to the Light <eos> (We won’t stop) <eos> We won’t stop until we see the light <eos> 
Yeah <eos> We're stuck in the same old standstill again <eos> Sick of waiting for you to feel it <eos> Always waiting for the next breakdown to begin <eos> Scared of getting too complicated <eos> What a shame (What a shame) <eos> Hiding in your shell again <eos> Bitter, fucked out of better days and missed opportunities <eos> I don't wanna hear that the times are changing <eos> I'm the same as I've always been <eos> Why can't you see? Are you even listening to me? <eos> I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become <eos> Get in or get out, I don't care, but don't waste my time <eos> Stand by my side or you can move on with your life <eos> Burnt out, enslaved, I'm left carry a weight that has me <eos> Worn down, in doubt, I'm left to drown with no oxygen <eos> Burnt out, drain me until there's nothing left to bleed <eos> Burdened by the chains and too exhausted to run away <eos> I gave you everything <eos> You spit it back in my face <eos> It never meant anything <eos> Left me to swallow the pain <eos> So much for the dream <eos> What a shame (What a shame) <eos> Hiding in your shell again <eos> Bitter, fucked out of better days and missed opportunities <eos> I don't wanna hear that the times are changing <eos> I'm the same as I've always been <eos> Why can't you see? Are you even listening to me? <eos> I am not the one to blame for the monsters we've become <eos> Get in or get out, I don't care, but don't waste my time <eos> Stand by my side or you can move on with your life <eos> You took what you could just to throw me away <eos> I gave you everything <eos> So much for the dream <eos> I gave you everything <eos> 
Storming through the party like my name was El Niño <eos> When I'm hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino <eos> As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name <eos> Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came <eos> I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school <eos> Never going, never showing up when we had to <eos> Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave <eos> I'm sick of always hearing "act your age" <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall <eos> But what would you expect with a conscience so small? <eos> Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised <eos> Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised <eos> 'Cause we like having fun at other people's expense and <eos> Cutting people down is just a minor offense then <eos> It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn <eos> I'm sick of being told to wait my turn <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> Don't count on me to let you know when <eos> Don't count on me, I'll do it again <eos> Don't count on me, it's the point you're missing <eos> Don't count on me, 'cause I'm not listening <eos> Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat <eos> Back-packed, and I don't give a shit about nothing <eos> You be standing on the corner talking all that kufuffin <eos> But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing <eos> 'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringing off the hook <eos> You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book <eos> I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion <eos> The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion <eos> I don't want to waste my time <eos> Become another casualty of society <eos> I'll never fall in line <eos> Become another victim of your conformity and back down <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Casualty of society <eos> (Waste my time with them) <eos> Victim of your conformity and back down <eos>

Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Esto que siento me supera y no lo aguanto <eos> Sin ti los días pasan sin su encanto <eos> No tengo nada en mi defensa, sabes que no soy un santo <eos> Pero si me lo preguntas, quizá no era para tanto <eos> Yo dando potes <eos> Gritando tu nombre con fuerza pa' que lo notes <eos> Camino donde caminas esperando que te topes <eos> Soñando que me llamas y voy a todo galope <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la nochе ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienеs, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Y tú en silencio <eos> El día de la noche ya no diferencio <eos> Y tú no vienes, ya no llamas, ya no estás <eos> Y si te invito pa' otro vals, tú ya no vas <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Te quise más de lo que tú me quisiste <eos> Inestable desde que te fuiste y muy triste <eos> Mi consciencia dice: "¿Acaso enloqueciste?" <eos> Y yo no sé qué decirle, me tiembla la voz <eos> Ya no veo tu luz <eos> Ahora estás lejos, ya no hay plenitud <eos> ¿Ahora cómo le haré pa' agarrar altitud? <eos> Me haces falta, no hay como tú, auh <eos> Me acostumbré a no estar solo, uh, uh <eos> Ando ansioso y no lo controlo, uh-uh-uh, uh <eos> Estoy consciente de toda la razón que había en la gente <eos> Te doy tu despedida, mi amor, un beso en la frente <eos> Lo mío por ti seguirá latente <eos> Detente, permíteme mirarte bien, no quiero olvidarte <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> Me quiero morir <eos> Sin tu corazón <eos> No aguanto a que vuelvas <eos> No aguanto el dolor <eos> 
The other night when we kissed <eos> You told me I was yours forever <eos> But when I woke up the next morning, you were gone <eos> Come back baby <eos> Come into my arms <eos> You, you showed me how love could be <eos> Just show me how much you need <eos> You've always been by my side <eos> Oh, baby that's no lie <eos> 'Cause I, I've always been true to you <eos> I've always loved one, that's true <eos> Oh baby, can't you see that it's you <eos> You know that I love you so <eos> Chorus: <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real <eos> I've always been too much for you it burns inside <eos> To wake up in the morning and you're not by my side <eos> Repeat (2x) <eos> You, you shared your thoughts with me <eos> You shared your secrecies <eos> And oh, how that makes me feel <eos> Listen baby, lets be forever <eos> 'Cause I, I know I will always be good <eos> I know in my heart I should <eos> I'll never ever do you wrong <eos> My love for you is strong <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> We, we can't just let this die <eos> You gotta give our love a try <eos> Oh please be by my side <eos> Don't even begin to cry <eos> 'Cause I, I'm waiting to be with you <eos> Just give me the chance to prove <eos> That I'm the only one for you <eos> You know I was the one <eos> Chorus (2x) <eos> You were not by my side, your not by my side <eos> Why aren't you here <eos> So please be by my side <eos> Please be by my side <eos> Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel <eos> This love for you is real <eos> It burns inside <eos> I know you're sorry you did me wrong <eos> But until then I'll remember <eos> You'll be back, back into my arms <eos>

Oh, thinkin' about our younger years <eos> There was only you and me <eos> We were young and wild and free <eos> Now nothin' can take you away from me <eos> We've been down that road before <eos> But that's over now <eos> You keep me comin' back for more <eos> Baby, you're all that I want <eos> When you're lyin' here in my arms <eos> I'm findin' it hard to believe <eos> We're in Heaven <eos> And love is all that I need <eos> And I found it there in your heart <eos> It isn't too hard to see <eos> We're in Heaven <eos> Oh, once in your life you find someone <eos> Who will turn your world around <eos> Bring you up when you're feelin' down <eos> Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me <eos> Oh, there's lots that I could say <eos> But just hold me now <eos> Cause our love will light the way <eos> And baby you're all that I want <eos> When you're lyin' here in my arms <eos> I'm finding it hard to believe <eos> We're in Heaven <eos> Yeah, love is all that I need <eos> And I found it there in your heart <eos> It isn't too hard to see <eos> We're in Heaven, yeah <eos> I've been waitin' for so long <eos> For somethin' to arrive <eos> For love to come along <eos> Now our dreams are comin' true <eos> Through the good times and the bad <eos> Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you <eos> And baby you're all that I want <eos> When you're lyin' here in my arms <eos> I'm findin' it hard to believe <eos> We're in Heaven <eos> And love is all that I need <eos> And I found it there in your heart <eos> It isn't too hard to see <eos> We're in Heaven, Heaven, woah <eos> You're all that I want <eos> You're all that I need <eos>

When I was a young boy, my mama said to me <eos> There's only one girl in the world for you <eos> And she's probably in Tahiti <eos> Or Maybe she's in the Bahamas <eos> Where the Caribbean Sea is blue <eos> We've been in a tropical moonlight night <eos> Cause nobody taught her 'bout you <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> Why am I hanging around in the rain out here <eos> Trying to pick up a girl <eos> Why are my eyes filling up with these lonely tears <eos> When there's girls all over the world <eos> Is she lying on a tropical beach somewhere <eos> Underneath the tropical sun <eos> Pining away in a heat wave there <eos> Hoping that I won't be long <eos> I should be lying on that sun soaked beach with her <eos> Caressing her warm brown skin <eos> Then in a year or maybe not quite <eos> We'll be sharing the same next of kin <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> Just to find her <eos> I'd go the whole wide world, I'd go the whole wide world <eos> To find out where they hide her <eos> 
Two young people without a thing <eos> Say some vows and spread their wings <eos> And settle down with just what they need <eos> Livin' on love <eos> She don't care 'bout what's in style <eos> She just likes the way he smiles <eos> It takes more than marble and tile <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Two old people without a thing <eos> Children gone but still they sing <eos> Side by side in that front porch swing <eos> Livin' on love <eos> He can't see anymore <eos> She can barely sweep the floor <eos> Hand in hand they'll walk through that door <eos> Just livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> Livin' on love, buyin' on time <eos> Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime <eos> Just like an old fashion story book rhyme <eos> Livin' on love <eos> But, it sounds simple that's what you're thinkin' <eos> But love can walk through fire without blinkin' <eos> It doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> No it doesn't take much when you get enough <eos> Livin' on love <eos> 
Toda la vida coleccionado mil amores <eos> Haciendo juegos malabares <eos> Para no amarte en exclusiva <eos> Toda la vida poniendo trampas al orgullo <eos> Tantas historias como estrellas <eos> Para no ser esclavo tuyo <eos> Para obtener mi propia musica <eos> Toda la vida descubriendo puertas a escondidas <eos> Para escapar de tus heridas <eos> Para buscar la aventuras que me liberen de tus besos <eos> Solo por eso, solo por eso <eos> Toda la vida para olvidate <eos> Para perderte y recuprate <eos> Y no dormirme en tus sentidos <eos> Como un idiota enamorado desmadejado <eos> Aburrido que se conforma <eos> Toda la vida marcando numeros secretos <eos> Mandando cartas a escondidas <eos> Haciendo citasindiscretas <eos> Como un romantico suicida, un suicidas <eos> Toda la vida sabiendo siempre que me esperas <eos> Siempre segura de ti misma <eos> Siempre mujer siempre perfecta <eos> Y yo buscando mi otra musica, mi propia musica <eos> En me musica aaah <eos> Toda la vida pensando siempre en tu egoismo <eos> Y por no ser esclavo tuyo <eos> Soy el esclavo de mi mismo <eos> Toda la vida tirando amor por por todos lados <eos> Dejando beso enganchados <eos> En cada nueva despedida <eos> Y tu al final la mas querida <eos> Toda la vida..... <eos> Toda la vida..... <eos> Toda La Vida <eos> Toda La Vida <eos> 
I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance <eos> They're looking for a little romance <eos> Given half a chance <eos> And I have never seen that dress you're wearing <eos> Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes <eos> I have been blind <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> But I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight <eos> I've never seen you shine so bright <eos> You were amazing <eos> I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side <eos> And when you turned to me and smiled <eos> It took my breath away <eos> And I have never had such a feeling <eos> Such a feeling of complete and utter love <eos> As I do tonight <eos> The lady in red is dancing with me <eos> Cheek to cheek <eos> There's nobody here <eos> It's just you and me <eos> It's where I want to be <eos> Well, I hardly know this beauty by my side <eos> I'll never forget the way you look tonight <eos> I never will forget the way you look tonight <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> The lady in red <eos> My lady in red <eos> I love you <eos> 
Maybe we could make it all right <eos> We could make it better sometime <eos> Maybe we could make it happen, baby <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> Just a little, little bit better <eos> Good enough to waste some time <eos> Tell me, would it make you happy, baby <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> We could keep trying but things will never change <eos> So I don't look back <eos> Still I'm dying with every step I take <eos> But I don't look back <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> And it hurts with every heartbeat <eos> 
Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever <eos> It paved a wave of distance between the syntax error <eos> From Austin's yellow brick road, this is forever <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled, no sign of relief <eos> 'Cause this you know, this you know, this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Makes no difference, your alphabet is missing letters <eos> Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather <eos> A drizzle, brisk and profound <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled no sign of relief <eos> This is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died <eos> If you can't get the best of us now <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> March Twenty-Third hushed the wind, the music died (You know) <eos> If you can't get the best of us now (You know) <eos> (You know) <eos> It's cause this is forever <eos> Strum this broken harp <eos> We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts <eos> Yes, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Cut and paste, were you sitting down <eos> On the beaded impotence of New Orleans? <eos> A hint of suspense when that telephone rings <eos> This is forever, this is forever, this is forever <eos> Makes no! Makes no! Makes no! <eos> Seventeen, embalmed, in caskets lowered into the weather <eos> A drizzle, brisk and profound <eos> From this Texas breath exhaled <eos> Strum this broken harp <eos> We were struck by the chords sent from their hearts <eos> This is forever, no turning back, this is forever <eos> (You know, you know) <eos> Yeah, this is forever, no turning back, this is forever <eos> (You know that this is forever) <eos> But you can't get the best of us now <eos>

They said I needed something in my life <eos> Said I was doing dumb shit all the time <eos> 'Cause broken dreams won't pay your bills at all <eos> I heard it was the wrong things I get right <eos> I blame it on the monsters in my mind <eos> With stories from outside these prison walls <eos> 'Cause even if we're hopeless <eos> And we know that this will hurt <eos> Tomorrow is just a word <eos> And they can't control <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Believers <eos> So incomplete, yet all we need <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> I said I wouldn't run but I'm terrified <eos> Headed for the sun but I'm scared of heights <eos> So you and me go falling through the dark <eos> You told me be someone that I like <eos> Instead of being someone in their eyes <eos> Your battle scars make you look like a star <eos> 'Cause even if we're hopeless <eos> And we know that this will hurt <eos> Tomorrow is just a word <eos> And they can't control <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Believers <eos> So incomplete, yet all we need <eos> Believers <eos> Let's raise a toast, enjoy the show <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> Want you to know that <eos> They can't control it <eos> No they can’t control <eos>

El perfume de su almohada, tú lo conoces bien <eos> Y la humedad de sus sábanas blancas también <eos> Qué suerte la tuya que puedes tenerlo a tus pies <eos> Sintiendo en tu boca sus besos que saben a miel <eos> Mirando cómo le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene <eos> Y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que día a día puedes tenerle <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que solo entre tus brazos se duerme <eos> ¿Quién como tú? <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que tarde a tarde esperas que llegue <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que con ternura cura sus fiebres <eos> ¿Quién como tú? <eos> Esas noches de locura, tú las disfrutas bien <eos> Y entre sus brazos las horas no pasan, lo sé <eos> Mirando cómo le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene <eos> Y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que día a día puedes tenerle <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que solo entre tus brazos se duerme <eos> ¿Quién como tú? <eos> ¿Quién como tú? Que día a día puedes tenerle <eos> ¿Quién como tú?

Juntos, la inmensidad <eos> Un mundo, nuestra casa chica, el tiempo no importa porque <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos para inventar <eos> A no aburrirnos <eos> Desafiar las horas de un futuro incierto <eos> Que solo nos sirve <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Coro: <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Nos juramos juntos que aunque la vida pase <eos> Los rios corran y los pajaros emigren <eos> Siempre habra un buen dia <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Basta que te mire <eos> Basta que te roce <eos> Bastan nuestros cuerpos humedos y tibios <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Para amarnos mas <eos> Juntos la eternidad <eos> Dos soledades <eos> Un iman perfecto <eos> Casi el egoismo <eos> Solo para amarnos <eos> Para amarnos mas... <eos> Coro... <eos> 
Oh, to see without my eyes <eos> The first time that you kissed me <eos> Boundless by the time I cried <eos> I built your walls around me <eos> White noise, what an awful sound <eos> Fumbling by Rogue River <eos> Feel my feet above the ground <eos> Hand of God, deliver me <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The first time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> Lord, I no longer believe <eos> Drowned in living waters <eos> Cursed by the love that I received <eos> From my brother's daughter <eos> Like Hephaestion, who died <eos> Alexander's lover <eos> Now my riverbed has dried <eos> Shall I find no other? <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> I'm running like a plover <eos> Now I'm prone to misery <eos> The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me <eos> How much sorrow can I take? <eos> Blackbird on my shoulder <eos> And what difference does it make <eos> When this love is over? <eos> Shall I sleep within your bed? <eos> River of unhappiness <eos> Hold your hands upon my head <eos> Till I breathe my last breath <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The last time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> 
Eva Lady Boss <eos> A culpada da tua ejaculação precoce <eos> Eles queriam que no rap eu fosse uma groupie <eos> Abanasse o booty por causa do Gucci <eos> Estou a dormir rappers sem usar a pussy <eos> Estou a comer rappers sem usar a pussy <eos> Farta desses pobres a falar de guita <eos> Cambada de paninas, nenhum rapper me excita <eos> Nem a minha fé em Deus me mete santa <eos> Minha kizomba é tão boa que até Valete canta <eos> Isso é se eu como quem mufete janta <eos> Elite boicota, o musseque levanta <eos> Eva Rapdiva, matéria que estudas <eos> Pra sincera não sei porque que ainda lutas <eos> Se o que separa a minha carreira da tua <eos> É o mesmo que separa a Terra da Lua <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Deixem passar a Lady Boss <eos> Eva (Rap Diva) <eos> Eva (Lady Boss) <eos> Eva <eos> Eva <eos> Big Boss desse game, olha para agenda <eos> Com o rapper pago algo tão sutil: renda <eos> Não há que me prenda, não há quem aprenda <eos> Estou big nesse game como as bolas do lenda <eos> Atravessei o continente, com cd's na mala <eos> Ninguém iguala até a magama bate pala <eos> Tornei rainha a chavala da sanzala <eos> Hoje sou a montanha que a tua inveja não escala <eos> E essas damas que me bifam, todas são fracas <eos> Todas têm filhos, mas carreiras são mbacas <eos> Todas querem cash, todas querem top <eos> Mas eu sou a rainha desse rap mangop <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Pra mim é de leve, pra mim é de leve <eos> Deixem passar a Lady Boss <eos> 
Creole Williams lived down a dirt road <eos> He made homemade wine like nobody I know <eos> I dropped by one Friday night and said, "Can you help me, Creole? <eos> I got a little girl waiting on me, and I want to treat her right." <eos> He said "I got what you need, son," as we sat down in the cellar <eos> He reached through the cobwebs as he turned on the light and said <eos> "There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time" <eos> You were sitting in the porch swing as I pulled up the driveway <eos> My old heart was racing as you climbed inside <eos> You slid over real close as we drove down to the lake road <eos> And watched the sun fade in that big red sky <eos> I reached under the front seat and said, "Now here's something special <eos> It's just been waiting for a night like tonight <eos> "There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time" <eos> You're still with me <eos> We've made some memories <eos> After all these years <eos> There's one thing I've found <eos> Some say good love <eos> Is like a fine wine <eos> It keeps getting better <eos> As the days go by <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But don't let it fool you about what's inside <eos> There might be a little dust on the bottle <eos> But it's one of those things that gets sweeter with time <eos> Don't let it fool you! <eos> 
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me <eos> I still feel your touch in my dream (In my dream) <eos> Forgive me, my weakness, but I don't know why <eos> Without you, it's hard to survive <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> Your arms are my castle, your heart is my sky <eos> They wipe away tears that I cry (That I cry) <eos> The good and the bad times, we've been through them all <eos> You make me rise when I fall <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last <eos> Need you by my side <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static <eos> And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky <eos> Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go <eos> Want you in my life <eos> 'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling <eos> And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly <eos> Can't you feel my heart beat fast?

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style <eos> In the air there's a feeling of Christmas <eos> Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile <eos> And on every street corner you hear <eos> Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells) <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> (Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green) <eos> As the shoppers rush home with their treasures <eos> (Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene) <eos> And above all this bustle you hear <eos> (Silver bells) Silver bells, (Silver bells) silver bells <eos> It's Christmas time in the city <eos> Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring) <eos> Soon it'll be Christmas Day <eos> Silver bells, silver bells, silver, silver bells <eos> 
"The problem is all inside your head," she said to me <eos> "The answer is easy if you take it logically <eos> I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover" <eos> She said "it's really not my habit to intrude <eos> Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued <eos> But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Ooh, slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free" <eos> She said "it grieves me so to see you in such pain <eos> I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again" <eos> I said "I appreciate that, and would you please explain <eos> About the 50 ways?" <eos> She said "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight <eos> And I believe in the morning, you'll begin to see the light" <eos> And then she kissed me, and I realized she probably was right <eos> There must be fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> Fifty ways to leave your lover <eos> You just slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just get yourself free <eos> Oh, you hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos> Slip out the back, Jack <eos> Make a new plan, Stan <eos> You don't need to be coy, Roy <eos> Just listen to me <eos> Hop on the bus, Gus <eos> You don't need to discuss much <eos> Just drop off the key, Lee <eos> And get yourself free <eos>

Sit there thinking <eos> In your room <eos> You feel the pressure <eos> You're going crazy too <eos> The walls around you <eos> Closing in <eos> You need a change <eos> Claustrophobic <eos> Feeling scared <eos> You need somebody <eos> But no one seems to care <eos> A one way ticket <eos> A change of pace <eos> You've had enough <eos> Can't take no more <eos> Breaking the chains around you <eos> Nobody else can bind you <eos> Take a good look around you <eos> Now you're breaking the chains <eos> Got this letter <eos> Came today <eos> From my baby <eos> Who left me yesterday <eos> Said she loves me <eos> She'll come back <eos> She wants to try <eos> I won't let her <eos> She'll be upset <eos> I know it's better <eos> Than something I'll regret <eos> She's been dishonest <eos> And insincere <eos> I lost my mind <eos> Twenty times a year <eos> Breaking the chains around me <eos> Nobody else can bind me <eos> Take a good look around me <eos> Now I'm breaking the chains <eos> Woke up today <eos> I'm alone <eos> I look around <eos> But baby you were gone <eos> But I don't mind <eos> And I don't worry <eos> I will survive <eos> I'm alone <eos> Now that you're gone <eos> Don't need nobody <eos> To hold or tie me down <eos> I broke the chains <eos> So let me be <eos> I've gotta be free <eos>  x2 <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos> 
Traigo huevos <eos> Y son más que los trae una cartera <eos> Pa' pegarnos en la madre donde quieran <eos> Con el equipo que yo traigo aquí se sientan <eos> Un minimi <eos> Un aparato que trae cada camioneta <eos> Un M4 con tubo no se despega <eos> Mi compañero en sus manos trae un 50 <eos> Si soy bélico <eos> Que por qué navego tantas camionetas <eos> Yo les respondo con una mirada seria <eos> Aquí la cosa es nada más con quien la deba <eos> Seguimos fuertes, señores <eos> Y arriba toda la chavalada <eos> 140 <eos> Son los monos que navego en donde sea <eos> Recuerden que la envidia también se desvela <eos> Pónganse truchas o los carga la carreta <eos> Doble rodado <eos> Que va enfrente con un tostón empotrado <eos> Vidrios duros pa' meterse a los chingazos <eos> Y aquel que corra, de lejos lo tostoneamos <eos> Mi gran respeto <eos> Este corrido es pa' todos los pistoleros <eos> Siempre a la orden y a la vez rifando el cuero <eos> Y un homenaje a los que quedan en el ruedo <eos> 
Wish I were with you <eos> But I couldn't stay <eos> Every direction <eos> Leads me away <eos> Pray for tomorrow <eos> But for today <eos> All I want is to be home <eos> Stand in the mirror <eos> You look the same <eos> Just lookin' for shelter <eos> From cold and the pain <eos> Someone to cover <eos> Safe from the rain <eos> Echoes and silence <eos> Patience and grace <eos> All of these moments <eos> I'll never replace <eos> No fear of my heart <eos> Absence of faith <eos> People I've loved <eos> I have no regrets <eos> Some I remember <eos> Some I forget <eos> Some of them living <eos> Some of them dead <eos> 
O Holy night! The stars are brightly shining <eos> It's the night of our dear Savior's birth <eos> Long lay the world in sin and error pining <eos> 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth <eos> A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices <eos> For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn <eos> Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices! <eos> O night divine, O night when Christ was born <eos> O night divine, O night divine! <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> Holy night <eos> 
To see age in a flower <eos> The dawns are speeding up <eos> You know it’ll hurt you <eos> Feel all of a sudden <eos> Tired and teary-eyed <eos> You knew it’d kill you <eos> Don’t wear a tie that’ll choke you <eos> To death in the city <eos> Take it off and forget <eos> Spare the fret that’ll make you <eos> Miss all of summer <eos> Sweat it out and forgive <eos> To see loss in a shower <eos> The petals turn to mush <eos> It still disappoints you <eos> Then less of a sudden <eos> You wire your weary mind <eos> To let it deceive you <eos> Don’t force a smile that’ll make you <eos> Resent the city <eos> Play it soft and forgive <eos> Keep the frown that’ll make you <eos> Squint in the summer <eos> Play it slow and forget <eos> 
El vino es mejor en tu boca <eos> Te amo es más tierno en tu voz <eos> La noche en tu cuerpo es más corta <eos> Me estoy enfermando de amor... <eos> Quisiera caminar en tu pelo <eos> Quisiera ser noche en tu piel <eos> Pensar que fue todo un sueño <eos> Después descubrirte otra vez... <eos> Y amarte como yo lo haría <eos> Como un hombre a una mujer <eos> Tenerte como cosa mía <eos> Y no podérmelo creer... <eos> Tan mía, mía, mía, mía <eos> Que eres parte de mi piel <eos> Conocerte fue mi suerte <eos> Amarte es un placer, mujer... <eos> Quisiera beber de tu pecho <eos> La miel del amanecer <eos> Mis dedos buscando senderos <eos> Llegar al final de tu ser <eos> Bailar el vals de las olas <eos> Cuerpo a cuerpo tu y yo <eos> Fundirme contigo en las sombras <eos> Y hacerte un poema de amor... <eos> Y amarte como yo lo haría <eos> Como un hombre a una mujer <eos> Tenerte como cosa mía <eos> Y no podérmelo creer... <eos> Tan mía, mía, mía, mía <eos> Que eres parte de mi piel <eos> Conocerte fue mi suerte <eos> Amarte es un placer, mujer... <eos> 
Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos>

One night to be confused <eos> One night to speed up truth <eos> We had a promise made <eos> Four hands and then away <eos> Both under influence <eos> We had divine sense <eos> To know what to say <eos> Mind is a razor blade <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> One night of magic rush <eos> The start a simple touch <eos> One night to push and scream <eos> And then relief <eos> Ten days of perfect hues <eos> The colors red and blue <eos> We had a promise made <eos> We were in love <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> And you, you knew the hand of the devil <eos> And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth <eos> Sharing different heartbeats <eos> In one night <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos>

Yo no he deseado jamás en la vida cambiarme por nadie <eos> Pues con mis defectos y con mis virtudes siempre supe aceptarme <eos> De mis fracasos, mis amores, siempre aprendí de mis errores <eos> Pero nunca celos o envidia de nadie jamás yo sentí <eos> Hasta que el destino me puso ante mi tu mirada de ángel <eos> Y así comenzó mi obsesión, mi delirio por conquistarte <eos> Pero al saber que no eras libre, no me alejé y en cambio quise <eos> Estar lo más cerca posible de ti, espiarte y seguirte allí donde vas <eos> Envidia, me muero de celos y envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia; <eos> Y siempre me estoy imaginando <eos> Las veces que él te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos <eos> Me muero de envidia <eos> Envidia, queriendo ser luna en la noche <eos> Y así ser testigo de tanto derroche <eos> Queriendo cambiar yo mi vida por la de ese hombre <eos> Y amarte hasta que se te olvide... su nombre <eos> Va contra mis principios, mi moral, mi dignidad <eos> El tener sentimientos de amor por una mujer ajena <eos> Que será mi condena... que me va a matar <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Ay me muero de envidia <eos> Pensando en la forma en que él te acaricia y te hace suya <eos> No puedo aguantar tantos celos, estoy que me muero de envidia <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> Estos celos con mi vida van a terminar <eos> Qué celos, los malditos celos <eos> No sé lo que me pasa, esta maldita envidia <eos> Que va a acabar conmigo yo lo sé, si no te hago mía <eos> Va contra mis principios mi moral, querer amar a una mujer que es ajena <eos> Vivir así no puedo más, en esta agonía <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> Te digo no puedo más <eos> Vivir así no puedo más <eos> No puedo, no puedo más <eos> 
Some folks are born made to wave the flag <eos> Ooh, they're red, white and blue <eos> And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief" <eos> Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no senator's son, son <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Some folks are born silver spoon in hand <eos> Lord, don't they help themselves, no <eos> But when the taxman come' to the door <eos> Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no millionaire's son, no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no <eos> Yeah, some folks inherit star spangled eyes <eos> Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord <eos> And when you ask 'em, "How much should we give?" <eos> Ooh, they only answer "More, more, more, more!" <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no military son, son, Lord <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, one <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate one, no no no <eos> It ain't me, it ain't me <eos> I ain't no fortunate son, no no no <eos> 
Lying in my bed <eos> I hear the clock tick, and think of you <eos> Caught up in circles <eos> Confusion is nothing new <eos> Flashback, warm nights <eos> Almost left behind <eos> Suitcase of memories <eos> Time after— <eos> Sometimes, you picture me <eos> I'm walking too far ahead <eos> You're calling to me <eos> I can't hear what you've said <eos> Then you say, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> After my picture fades <eos> And darkness has turned to gray <eos> Watching through windows <eos> You're wondering if I'm okay <eos> Secrets stolen from deep inside <eos> The drum beats out of time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> You said, "Go slow." <eos> I fall behind <eos> The second hand unwinds <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting <eos> Time after time <eos> If you're lost, you can look and you will find me <eos> Time after time <eos> If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting) <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> Time after time <eos> 
Well I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos> They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried <eos> It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid <eos> They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did <eos> Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town <eos> I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around <eos> I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me <eos> Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee <eos> Daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand <eos> I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band <eos> Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away <eos> There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave <eos> I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze <eos> I can see him half stoned pickin` up the Lovesick Blues <eos> When Clayton died I made him a promise <eos> I was gonna carry on somehow <eos> I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now <eos> I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos> Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried <eos> Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do <eos> But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too <eos> Yeah I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos>

Back through the years I go wandering once again <eos> Back to the seasons of my youth <eos> I recall a box of rags that someone gave us <eos> And how my mama put the rags to use <eos> There were rags of many colors, every piece was small <eos> And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall <eos> Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love <eos> She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of <eos> As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read <eos> About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said <eos> Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness <eos> And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss <eos> My coat of many colors that my mama made for me <eos> Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly <eos> Although we had no money I was rich as I could be <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes <eos> In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school <eos> Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich <eos> And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch <eos> And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed <eos> And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes <eos> But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see <eos> That one is only poor only if they choose to be <eos> Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be <eos> In my coat of many colors my mama made for me <eos> Made just for me <eos>

In this room I'm sitting by your side <eos> 'Cause it rains for hours and the phone is off its hook <eos> Standing on the edge <eos> Casting lots to set me up before you knock me down <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> You let it go and then you fold <eos> So we stay on the open road <eos> We drive for hours and still no end in sight at all <eos> Driving in your car, miss the stop sign, fall in love, just to get knocked out <eos> Off the summer's edge and drown me <eos> We're betting on our own lives, making up for all time we lost <eos> In this house of cards we're all holding hearts and spades <eos> (one breath, one step could knock it all down) <eos> But you lead with your eyes and you give it away <eos> (decide, design to cut from the clouds) <eos> When the people you love get lost in the shuffle <eos> (when you leave, you leave nothing but broken hearts) <eos> Pull your punches and burn with your cigarettes <eos> Pulled like a punch and burnt like a cigarette? <eos> Forever <eos> 
Ow! <eos> Heeey, yeah! <eos> I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure <eos> And I just can't wait 'till the day when you knock on my door <eos> Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down <eos> 'Cause I just can't wait 'till you write me you're coming around <eos> Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, yeah <eos> I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true <eos> And I don't want to spend my whole life just a-waiting for you <eos> Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no <eos> I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay <eos> Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Yeah, oh yeah <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Walking on sunshine <eos> Walking on sunshine <eos> I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <eos> I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <eos> I'm on sunshine, baby, oh <eos> Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby <eos> Ow! <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> I say it, I say it, I say it again, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, yeah, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> I say it, I say it, I say it again, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> And tell me, tell me, tell me it again now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hooooh, yeah now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> Hooooh, yeah, Hooooh, yeah, Hooooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos>

Te siento tan distante y tan cerca a la vez <eos> Descifrando tu silencio <eos> Y entonces me imagino dentro de tu piel <eos> Pero pierdo en el intento <eos> Y por más que busco darte amor <eos> Nunca te fijas en mí <eos> Si supieras que puedo morir por ti, por ti <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Como estrella tan distante <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Invisible como el aire <eos> Eres tan inalcanzable <eos> Tan sublime como un ángel <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Como un fuego que no arde <eos> Te me has vuelto inalcanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Pervivo en la vereda de tu soledad <eos> Cuando alguien te lastima <eos> Qué ganas de decirte que no hay nadie más <eos> Que te ame sin medida <eos> Cómo duele verte suspirar por quien no te hace feliz <eos> Si supieras que puedo morir por ti, por ti <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Como estrella tan distante <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Invisible como el aire <eos> Eres tan inalcanzable <eos> Tan sublime como un ángel <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Como un fuego que no arde <eos> Te me has vuelto inalcanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Como estrella tan distante <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Invisible como el aire <eos> Eres tan inalcanzable <eos> Tan sublime como un ángel <eos> Un amor casi imposible <eos> Como un fuego que no arde <eos> Te me has vuelto inalcanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> Inacanzable <eos> Inalcanzable <eos> 
Some people want diamond rings <eos> Some people want snow <eos> Some people want everything <eos> Tied in strings and bows <eos> I can't think of a single thing <eos> For my list this year <eos> Cause all that i'll ever need <eos> I have right here <eos> I got all I want this year for Christmas <eos> Don't need no presents underneath the tree <eos> 'Cause all I want this year for Christmas <eos> Is waking up with you right here next to me <eos> You took me by the hand <eos> Brought me in from the cold <eos> You give me the kind of love <eos> Oh, that feels like home <eos> Every season together <eos> I'll be there by your side <eos> Through all of the highs and the lows <eos> Its a wonderful life <eos> I got all I want this year for Christmas <eos> Don't need no presents underneath the tree <eos> 'Cause all I want this year for Christmas <eos> Is waking up with you right here next to me, oh <eos> Take the  <eos> Take the lights on the tree <eos> Ooh, 'cause this year for Christmas <eos> I've  got all I need <eos> I got all I want this year for Christmas <eos> Don't need no presents underneath the tree <eos> 'Cause all I want every year for Christmas <eos> Is waking up with you right next to me, oh <eos> Is waking up with you right next to me <eos> Next to me <eos> Right here, next to me <eos> 
Vosotras, las familiares <eos> Inevitables golosas; <eos> Vosotras mosca vulgares <eos> Me evocais todas las cosas <eos> Oh viejas moscas voraces <eos> Como abejas en abril <eos> Viejas moscas pertinaces <eos> Sobre mi calva infantil <eos> Moscas de todas las horas <eos> De infancia y adolescencia <eos> De mi juventud dorada; <eos> De esta segunda inocencia <eos> Que da en no creer en nada, en nada <eos> Moscas del primer hastío <eos> En el salón familiar <eos> Las claras tardes de estío <eos> En que yo empece a soñar! <eos> Y en la aborrecida escuela <eos> Raudas mosca divertidas <eos> Perseguidas, perseguidas <eos> Por amor de lo vuela <eos> Yo se que os habeis posado <eos> Sobre el juguete encantado <eos> Sobre el librote cerrado <eos> Sobre las cartas de amor <eos> Sobre los párpados yertos <eos> De los muertos <eos> Inevitables golosas <eos> Que ni labrais como abejas <eos> Ni brillais cual mariposas <eos> Pequeñitas, revoltosas <eos> Vosotras, amigas viejas <eos> Me evocais todas las cosas <eos> 
Every time we lie awake <eos> After every hit we take <eos> Every feeling that I get <eos> But I haven't missed you yet <eos> Every roommate kept awake <eos> By every sigh and scream we make <eos> All the feelings that I get <eos> But I still don't miss you yet <eos> Only when I stop to think about it <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> Every time we lie awake <eos> After every hit we take <eos> Every feeling that I get <eos> But I haven't missed you yet <eos> Only when I stop to think about it <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> Only when I stop to think about you, I know <eos> Only when you stop to think about me, do you know? <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> You hate everything about me <eos> Why do you love me? <eos> I hate, you hate <eos> I hate, you love me <eos> I hate everything about you <eos> Why do I love you? <eos> 
Me muero por robarte un beso <eos> Y porque pierda la razón <eos> Tal vez asi me atrevería <eos> Y pierda miedo el corazón <eos> Me muero por amar despacio <eos> La prisa no nos debe apurar <eos> Ya sabes que la vida es un viaje <eos> Y yo lo quiero disfrutar <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Me muero por cruzar el tiempo <eos> Si el alma no se puede ver <eos> Qué pasa si se va la vida <eos> O tal vez solo un recuerdo es <eos> Por eso si el recuerdo queda <eos> Que quede la memoria llena <eos> La quiero saturar por contemplar <eos> Tus ojos y una luna llena <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti, por ti <eos> Me muero por vivir contigo <eos> Lo que me queda por andar <eos> Pedirle a dios que cambie el tiempo <eos> Y que lo vuelta eternidad <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si yo me muero <eos> Muero de amor, por ti <eos>

I met you in a bathroom stall <eos> Kissing  up against the wall <eos> Thinking  it was love right there, right then <eos> And I don't want this night to end <eos> Why'd you have to make me fall <eos> Right  before the final call? <eos> Hoping  you will tell me where and when <eos> 'Cause I just wanna do it again <eos> What  if this is not just for the night - the night, baby? <eos> Say the word and I'd be down for life <eos> For life <eos> I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've  got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Is it love? <eos> I'm just tryinna make it last <eos> Throwing back another glass <eos> I ain't never felt a rush like that <eos> You make me wanna move too fast <eos> Fall for the way we dance <eos> A little bit of man on man, yeah <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> But I just wanna do it again <eos> What if this is not just for the night - the night, baby? <eos> Say the word and I'd be down for life <eos> For life <eos> I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Is it love? <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> Or maybe just not enough <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> Maybe I've had too much <eos> Or maybe just not enough <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> And I've known you for a second, but it's more than enough <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> Some kind of a record giving all that I've got <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> We've got something special, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> There's something about you, something about you <eos> I don't wanna let go, is it love or just Prosecco? <eos> 
Find your feet <eos> Don't look down <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> We can't climb <eos> If we're intertwined <eos> Oh, I never would have thought we were holding on <eos> For too long <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Trust these words <eos> Though I get a little tongue-tied sometimes <eos> We're worth <eos> More than I ever could know <eos> 'Cos we've come a little far just to give it up <eos> But I kinda feel like we've given up now <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> And you might just say that you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me 'cos we can't see <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> Like the first time and now I leave <eos> And you might just say you love me <eos> But it kills me that we can't breathe <eos> And you might just say you love me again <eos> It's alright <eos> Release the pressure <eos> Don't hold tight <eos> We need to learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> Learn to let go <eos> Let go <eos> 
Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime lo que sientes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> Cuando llamas a mi puerta <eos> Voy a abrir <eos> Y ya no estás (no estás, no estás) <eos> Quizá me habré explicado mal (y tan mal) <eos> O eres tú que no me entiendes <eos> Da igual <eos> To' lo que haces no es pensando en mi <eos> Y yo escribiendo cosas para ti <eos> Escucho tus silеncios pa' dormir <eos> Te da igual <eos> Si me voy <eos> Te da igual <eos> Ya no еstoy <eos> Baby, ¿por qué odiabas verme? <eos> Hacerte reír <eos> Lock the door, cierra la puerta <eos> Que me quede a oscuras <eos> Como si estoy en Berghain <eos> Huye y lárgate de mi ciudad <eos> Se que no todo va a ser igual <eos> Let's go <eos> Baby no queda tiempo <eos> Días que pasan lentos <eos> Y si tú no vuelves, yo te hago voodoo <eos> Voy a maldecirte clavarte en la cruz <eos> Maybe ya da igual, no importa lo que diga <eos> Te da igual <eos> Dime ma, ¿qué hice mal? <eos> Te da igual, te da igual <eos> A ti te da igual <eos> To' lo que haces no es pensando en mi <eos> Y yo escribiendo cosas para ti <eos> Escucho tus silencios pa' dormir <eos> Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime lo que sientes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> Cuando menos te lo esperas <eos> Todo vuelve <eos> Dime que me quieres <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si en invierno no me escribes <eos> Me da igual <eos> Si el verano me prometes <eos> 
I am thinking it's a sign <eos> That the freckles in our eyes <eos> Are mirror images <eos> And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned <eos> And I have to speculate <eos> That God himself did make <eos> Us into corresponding shapes <eos> Like puzzle pieces from the clay <eos> And true, it may seem like a stretch <eos> But it's thoughts like this that catch <eos> My troubled head when you're away <eos> When I am missing you to death <eos> When you are out there on the road <eos> For several weeks of shows <eos> And when you scan the radio <eos> I hope this song will guide you home <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> I tried my best to leave <eos> This all on your machine <eos> But the persistent beat <eos> It sounded thin upon listening <eos> And that frankly will not fly <eos> You will hear the shrillest highs <eos> And lowest lows with the windows down <eos> When this is guiding you home <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> "Come down now," they'll say <eos> But everything looks perfect from far away <eos> "Come down now," but we'll stay <eos> (They will see us waving from such great heights) <eos> (Come down now) <eos> They will see us waving from such great heights <eos> (Come down now) <eos> 
It's been way too long since you slipped away <eos> I just can't forget, I can't pretend it's ok <eos> No other one could ever replace you <eos> So I'll keep on believing and dreaming of you <eos> Soft steel guitar oh how I've missed you <eos> Words from the heart let me hear you again <eos> Sounds from the soul, fiddle I need you <eos> Sweet country music where have you gone? <eos> Sweet country music please come back home <eos> The songs from your memory I cling to today <eos> I won't let them leave me, I won't let them fade <eos> I don't care what thеy do, you're still the one <eos> I'll bе here in Nashville 'til you return <eos> Soft steel guitar oh how I've missed you <eos> Words from the heart let me hear you again <eos> Sounds from the soul, fiddle I need you <eos> Sweet country music where have you gone? <eos> Sweet country music please come back home <eos> Sweet country music where have you gone? <eos> The airwaves are waiting ,please come back home <eos> 
Hooray it's Christmas time <eos> But there's one lousy tradition <eos> There's a certain show that you will see <eos> That is all and many would agree <eos> It is time to find another show to substitute <eos> For the Nutcracker <eos> I'm watching the game <eos> But something's wrong <eos> Staring is my wife <eos> Her face looks long <eos> I know that look, it must be me <eos> It's not our anniversary <eos> I shrug, no clue <eos> What did I do <eos> She stands in disbelief (What?) <eos> This holiday scene brings no laughter <eos> Forced going to see The Nutcracker <eos> I try to block it from my mind <eos> Think fast, what reason can I find? <eos> Got work to do, I'll fake the flu <eos> No chance, I'm done, I'm screwed (No!) <eos> I've seen the Nutcracker twenty times <eos> Sure it is fun if you are four (bum) <eos> Don't call me a Scrooge 'cause it's a bore <eos> The story's dated and that Mouse King thing <eos> Freaks me out (Ahh!) <eos> Well, guess I'm a guy, what can I say <eos> I'd rather watch football than ballet <eos> I try my hardest not to groan <eos> And pull the score up on my phone <eos> As I complain, "It's not the same" <eos> We're rushing out the door (Go!) <eos> All holiday shoppers on the road <eos> My holiday spirit might explode <eos> Of course, there is no place to park <eos> We're late, the theatre's in the dark <eos> In no small feat, we find a seat <eos> The show's about to start (Shh) <eos> Here's that song from Tetris <eos> And I know it's the part <eos> When I fight not to fall asleep <eos> March the wooden soldiers <eos> Bunch of mice start a fight <eos> Land of sweets, man this stuff's trippy <eos> By the way, this story makes no sense <eos> Still don't know what it means <eos> After all these years <eos> So confusing, feel like snoozing <eos> Eyes are heavy, as I start to dream <eos> Woah, I'm awake, must have fallen asleep <eos> Guess I didn't snore or make a peep <eos> 'Cause my wife had no clue I'd been out cold <eos> Is the finale coming up <eos> 'Cause there is no beer left in my cup <eos> To make it through, I'll need another drink <eos> Snuck out to the lobby <eos> Oh, look, I found a TV <eos> I forgot the game was happening <eos> It's down to the wire <eos> Time will soon expire <eos> Down by one, this kick would win it <eos> (Hut, hut) The ball snapped <eos> (Oh, no) The kick's bad <eos> (Wide right) No <eos> (We lost) No <eos> How could this night get any worse? <eos> Now I'm feeling all depressed <eos> But I still have to act impressed <eos> A pirouette, oh wow, that's great <eos> A six-year-old could do that, too <eos> Saw my team lose at the bar <eos> Now dancing dudes in leotards <eos> Last Nutcracker hopefully <eos> But my wife's thinking differently <eos> She leans in closely, whispers softly <eos> "Can't wait for you to take me next year." <eos> 
I wanna run away <eos> Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life <eos> Send me a gun and I'll see the sun <eos> I'd rather run away <eos> Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life <eos> Send me a gun and I'll see the sun <eos> You need an instant ease <eos> From your life where you got plenty <eos> Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh) <eos> You just take it all to the face <eos> I know that you want to cry <eos> But there's much more to life than dyin' <eos> Over your past mistakes (Oh) <eos> And people who threw dirt on your name <eos> Since ten, I been feelin' lonely <eos> Had friends, but they was pickin' on me <eos> Always thinkin', "Why my lips so big? <eos> Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?" <eos> These gay thoughts would always haunt me <eos> I prayed God would take it from me <eos> It's hard for you when you're fightin' <eos> And nobody knows it when you're silent <eos> I'd be by the phone <eos> Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn <eos> Only place I felt like I belonged <eos> Strangers make you feel so loved, you know? <eos> And I'm happy by the way <eos> That I made that jump, that leap of faith <eos> I'm happy that it all worked out for me <eos> I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh <eos> I wanna run away <eos> Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life <eos> Send me a gun and I'll see the sun <eos> I'd rather run away <eos> Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life <eos> Send me a gun and I'll see the sun <eos> You need an instant ease <eos> From your life where you got plenty <eos> Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh) <eos> You just take it all to the face <eos> I know that you want to cry <eos> But there's much more to life than dying <eos> Over your past mistakes (Oh) <eos> And people who threw dirt on your name <eos> Ha-ah, ha-ah, no-ah <eos>

I have climbed the highest mountains <eos> I have run through the fields <eos> Only to be with you <eos> Only to be with you <eos> I have run, I have crawled <eos> I have scaled these city walls <eos> These city walls <eos> Only to be with you <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> I have kissed honey lips <eos> Felt the healing in her fingertips <eos> It burned like fire <eos> This burning desire <eos> I have spoke with the tongue of angels <eos> I have held the hand of a devil <eos> It was warm in the night <eos> I was cold as a stone <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> I believe in the Kingdom Come <eos> Then all the colours will bleed into one <eos> Bleed into one <eos> But yes, I'm still running <eos> You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains <eos> Carried the cross of my shame <eos> Of my shame <eos> You know I believe it <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> But I still haven't found <eos> What I'm looking for <eos> 
Water towers are made for hearts and names <eos> Friday nights are made for football games <eos> Fallin' leaves are made for fallin' in <eos> Front porch steps are made for goodnight kissin' <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Summer jobs are made for spendin' cash <eos> Second dates are made for goin' fast <eos> Early curfews are made for sneakin' past <eos> 2 a.m. was made for pissed off dads <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Like a ship without a sea <eos> Or a song without a melody <eos> I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do <eos> 'Cause I was made for you <eos> Smoky bars are made for "How 'bout a dance?" <eos> Open roads are made for holdin' hands and <eos> Laid back seats are made for young love <eos> Two pink lines are made for growin' up <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> Like a ship without a sea <eos> Or a song without a melody <eos> I don't know where I'd be or what I'd do <eos> 'Cause I was made for you <eos> Tiny shoes are made for tiny feet <eos> My two arms are made for where you sleep <eos> Sky was made for the moon and stars <eos> You were made to steal my heart <eos> And I was made for you, yeah I was made for you <eos> 
I wanted space, not destruction <eos> I wanted a river, not the ocean <eos> 'Cause when I break it down, down to nothing <eos> I know I want and who I am <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> I wanna be a rock, not an island <eos> I wanna be the answer, not the problem <eos> Seven sins a stolen glance, the big reveal, a second chance <eos> Trusted friend, a life unchained, forgiveness for mistakes we've made <eos> Lookin' for the answers from here to California <eos> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road <eos> The further I go, the more I wanna get closer <eos> I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, let you love shine in now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Ooh, ooh) <eos> Let your light shine in (Come on, come on, let your light now) <eos> Let your light shine in (Yeah) <eos> All my life, I've been looking for somebody <eos> Don't lose sight, hold on <eos> When the sky is getting dark, I'll be praying for the stars <eos> Come on, let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos> Let your light shine in <eos>

Each day through my window I watch her as she passes by <eos> I say to myself, "You're such a lucky guy <eos> To have a girl like her is truly a dream come true <eos> Out of all the fellows in the world, she belongs to you" <eos> But it was just my imagination, runnin' away with me <eos> It was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> Soon we'll be married and raise a family (Oh yeah) <eos> A cozy little home out in the country <eos> With two children, maybe three <eos> I tell you I can visualize it all <eos> This couldn't be a dream for too real it all seems <eos> But it was just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> Ev'ry night on my knees I pray, Dear Lord, hear my plea <eos> Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die <eos> Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me <eos> I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me <eos> Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> I’ve never met her but I can't forget her <eos> Just my imagination once again runnin' away with me <eos> Just my imagination runnin' away with me <eos> 
Cut open my heart <eos> Right at the scar <eos> And loosen up <eos> Gonna do what I'm told <eos> Go where I'm told <eos> And loosen up <eos> Take a shot in the rain <eos> One for the pain <eos> And loosen up <eos> I tried all the way <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> Going to soften the blow <eos> Soften the blow <eos> And give it up <eos> I saw the surprise <eos> The look in your eyes <eos> I gave it up <eos> Gonna be who I am <eos> Be who I am <eos> And give it up <eos> I tried all the way <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos> It's all better now, it's all better now <eos> Wait for me, wait for me <eos>

Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Little darling, it's been a long, cold, lonely winter <eos> Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Little darling, the smiles returning to the faces <eos> Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Sun, sun, sun, here it comes <eos> Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting <eos> Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear <eos> Here comes the sun, here comes the sun <eos> And I say it's alright <eos> It's alright <eos> 
Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos> Sun dress on the front steps <eos> Sun up by the lake <eos> Blanket down in the backyard <eos> Lying wide awake <eos> That's a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Moonlight on the back seat <eos> A breeze through the wires <eos> Springsteen on the speakers <eos> Girl, I'm on fire <eos> That's stuff I don't think about <eos> 'Cause it still kills me now <eos> I still can't dance around <eos> That memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> It's good running into you like this <eos> But, girl, I'm close as I can get <eos> To a memory I don't mess with <eos> The girl I was the best with <eos> The one I was obsessed with <eos> Girl, you just don't get it <eos> I'd fall right back with one slip <eos> Always leaves me helpless <eos> Don't hate me, I can't help it <eos> Gotta leave us where we left it <eos> You're a memory I don't mess with <eos> Red leaves on the river <eos> Footprints in the sand <eos> Cold walk in December <eos> Warming up your hands <eos> 
Letra de Centinela de Vacío <eos> Solo... cuando logro acallar <eos> Por un momento <eos> El fantasma que pernocta y asfixia <eos> Mi pensamiento <eos> Por así decirlo <eos> Sí, decir...lo <eos> Entonces <eos> A lo mejor <eos> Puedo escuchar la playa <eos> En mi respiración <eos> Entonces soy una caja hueca <eos> Capaz de guardar <eos> Entonces soy un centinela <eos> Que gira alrededor <eos> De un vacío <eos> Muy lleno <eos> Pero cuando lleno <eos> Queda muy vacío <eos> (a)guardando el próximo respiro <eos> Será por eso <eos> Que el pecho <eos> (a)guarda el corazón <eos> Cada vez que vivo muero <eos> Cada vez que muero vivo <eos> En un respiro <eos> ¿hasta cuando un centinela del vacío? <eos> "Respira" <eos> Me dijo un buen amigo <eos> "Que el oxígeno es <eos> Tu amigo" <eos> Entonces <eos> Respiro <eos> Porque Oxígeno es <eos> Mi amigo <eos> Es mi mejor amigo <eos> Y cuando al fin <eos> Desde el pecho <eos> En un acto <eos> En un salto <eos> Oxígeno se convirtió <eos> En palabra <eos> Es... piritu <eos> Desde entonces <eos> Puedo escuchar <eos> El mar en mi corazón <eos> 
When we were young and still in love <eos> We didn't care what we were made of <eos> Our eyes were set on a distant sun <eos> It was shimmering gold <eos> Then slowly one by one <eos> We carried our past and cradled the storm <eos> We tried to conceal the scars we wore <eos> 'Cause we couldn't show what we couldn't show <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments we share <eos> Love's truest meaning lives when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> And then the silence fell <eos> We bit our tongues, with which we tell <eos> All of our dreams, and the stories we sell <eos> But we didn't know what we didn't know <eos> I get lost sometimes <eos> With you I am found <eos> I get lost so I'll follow the light to your heart <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart <eos> I'm still caught in your gravity <eos> No matter the distance between us <eos> Our joy lives in the moments when you're not there <eos> Will you wait, will you wait for me? <eos> There's always a space in my heart for you <eos> 
There ain’t nothing more depressing than a pine tree <eos> Gussied up with candy canes and balls <eos> Those carollers have kept me up for hours <eos> "It’s Merry Christmas" — seeping through my walls <eos> Now, I’m no wiccan commie nut or nothing <eos> But there’s one damn holiday that I can’t stand <eos> It ain’t Halloween, or Thanksgiving, or even April Fools <eos> But it’ll surely make a fool out of every man <eos> Ha! <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> You know where to stick those jingle bells <eos> If I ain’t hammered, it ain’t Hanukkah <eos> And all you motherfuckers go to hell <eos> If I ain’t cock-eyed, it ain’t Kwanzaa <eos> Joy to the world of Jack & Cokes <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> ‘Cuz I ain’t ever anything but broke <eos> Now, every year the malls are just a madhouse <eos> Full of empty pockets, thoughts and smiles <eos> Just the smell of eggnog makes me vomit <eos> And those colored lights are fucking infantile <eos> I think, we collectively as a people <eos> Should rise against this corporate jolly noise <eos> And tell the world: "Let’s buy some peace and quiet for a change <eos> Before we spend it all on fucking toys!" <eos> Ha! <eos> So, if I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> You know where to stick those jingle bells <eos> If I ain’t hammered, it ain’t Hanukkah <eos> Fa-la-la-la-la, go fuck yourself <eos> If I ain’t cock-eyed, it ain’t Kwanzaa <eos> Joy to the world of getting stoned <eos> If I ain’t drunk then it ain’t Christmas <eos> So leave this goddamn Scrooge the fuck alone <eos> Merry Fucking Christmas <eos> 
If you could only read my mind <eos> You would know that things between us ain't right <eos> I know your arms are open wide <eos> But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie <eos> Your one vice <eos> Is you're too nice <eos> Come around now, can't you see? <eos> I want you, all tattooed <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complete me, mistreat me <eos> Want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> If you could only read my mind <eos> You would know that I've been waiting <eos> So long <eos> For someone almost just like you <eos> But with attitude, I'm waiting <eos> So come on <eos> Get out of clothes time <eos> Grow out those highlights <eos> Come around now, can't you see? <eos> I want you, in a vinyl suit <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complicated, x-rated <eos> I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> Bad <eos> Don't get me wrong <eos> I know you're only being good <eos> But that's what's wrong <eos> I guess I just misunderstood <eos> I want you, all tattooed <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complicated, x-rated <eos> I want you bad <eos> I mean it, I need it <eos> I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> Bad, really, really bad <eos> 
Once in royal David's city <eos> Stood a lowly cattle shed <eos> Where a mother laid her Baby <eos> In a manger for His bed: <eos> Mary was that mother mild <eos> Jesus Christ her little Child <eos> He came down to earth from heaven <eos> Who is God and Lord of all <eos> And His shelter was a stable <eos> And His cradle was a stall; <eos> With the poor, and mean, and lowly <eos> Lived on earth our Saviour holy <eos> And our eyes at last shall see Him <eos> Through His own redeeming love; <eos> For that Child so dear and gentle <eos> Is our Lord in heaven above <eos> And He leads His children on <eos> To the place where He is gone <eos> Not in that poor lowly stable <eos> With the oxen standing by <eos> We shall see Him; but in heaven <eos> Set at God's right hand on high; <eos> When like stars His children crowned <eos> All in white shall wait around <eos>

They were farm kids way down in Dixie <eos> Met in high school in the sixties <eos> Everyone knew it was love from the start <eos> One July, in the midnight hour <eos> He climbed upon the water tower <eos> Stood on the rail and painted a ten-foot heart <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said that he should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> They settled down on eighty acres <eos> Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes <eos> They went together like a hand and a glove <eos> On a clear day from their front yard <eos> If you look and know what to look for <eos> Off to the east, you can still read his words of love <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the boy should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> Now more than once the town has discovered <eos> Painting over it ain't no use <eos> There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it <eos> The heart keeps showing through <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the fool should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> Ah, paint it green boy <eos> In John Deere green <eos> On a hot summer night <eos> He wrote "Billy Bob loves Charlene" <eos> In letters three-foot-high <eos> And the whole town said the boy should have used red <eos> But it looked good to Charlene <eos> In John Deere green <eos> John Deere green <eos> 
Trying to find a new home <eos> Trying to write a new song <eos> Trying to find a rhythm, that’ll help me <eos> Ooh, wanna get through it <eos> Hmm, keep singing the blues <eos> Everybody’s saying: <eos> “You gotta get a way in! <eos> Go deal with the real stuff” <eos> And I-I-I, it’s gotta be true enough <eos> Yeah, keep singing the blues <eos> Well, you know?! I’m just passing on <eos> Singing the same old song <eos> Sometimes it feels so right and I don’t feel all alone <eos> But when the music fades and the crowd drives away <eos> I’m starring at the mirror, yeah <eos> Singing the blues <eos> Ohh, staring at the mirror, yeah <eos> Still singing the blues <eos> I got a little up with reggae <eos> And I can lift and appreciate <eos> But I rather be high-old and <eos> Singing the blues <eos> Yeah, I’ve been in and out of soul <eos> Even rock and roll <eos> But a little baby blue play <eos> Never, never gets old and I realized <eos> Boy, I gotta have me some blue blues <eos> Yeah <eos> You know?! I’m just passing on <eos> Singing the same old song <eos> Sometimes it feels so right and I don’t feel all alone <eos> But when the music fades and the crowd drives away <eos> I’m starring at the mirror <eos> Oh, still Singing the blues <eos> Yeah, staring at the mirror <eos> Still singing the blues <eos> Yeah, I’m just passing on <eos> Singing the same old song <eos> Sometimes it feels so right and I don’t feel all alone <eos> But when the music fades and the crowd drives away <eos> I’m staring at the mirror, yeah <eos> Oh, starring at the mirror <eos> Still singing, still singing, singing <eos> Still singing the blues, singing the blues <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> Singing the blues, singing the blues <eos> Singing the – <eos> Blues <eos> Yeah <eos> 
And with the early dawn moving right along <eos> I couldn't buy an eyeful of sleep <eos> And in the aching night under satellites <eos> I was not received <eos> Built with stolen parts, a telephone in my heart <eos> Someone get me a priest <eos> To put my mind to bed, this ringing in my head <eos> Is this a cure or is this a disease? <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in the after birth on the quiet earth <eos> Let the stains remind you <eos> You thought you made a man, you better think again <eos> Before my role defines you <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> And in your waiting hands, I will land <eos> And roll out of my skin <eos> And in your final hours, I will stand <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Ready to begin <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Nail in my head from my creator <eos> You gave me life, now show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> Show me how to live <eos> 
I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye <eos> I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time <eos> Everything is 3D blasphemy <eos> My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up <eos> This is not the way I pictured me <eos> I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? <eos> Something about this, so very wrong <eos> I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this <eos> Is it a dream or a memory? <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this? <eos> But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate <eos> I have sinned by just <eos> Making my mind up and taking your breath away <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> Goodbye! <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> You haven't learned a thing <eos> I haven't changed a thing <eos> The flesh was in my bones <eos> The pain was always free <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> I've felt the hate rise up in me <eos> Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <eos> I wander out where you can't see <eos> Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <eos> And it waits for you <eos> 
Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago <eos> Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator. Tommy the cat had many a story to tell, but it was a rare occasion such as this that he did <eos> She came a'sliding on down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot Biscuit. The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days. The sight was beyond belief. Many a head snapped for double even triple, takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbys were known to hang out. They hung out in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place... and that was O'malley's Alley. <eos> The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended) But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was looking for that stud bull. She was looking for that He-cat. And that was me. Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee: <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby! <eos> Say baby! <eos>

I move your picture from my wall <eos> I replace them both large and small <eos> And each new day finds me so blue <eos> But nothing takes the place of you <eos> I read your letters one by one <eos> I still love you when it's all said and done <eos> And oh, my darling, I'm so blue <eos> Because nothing, oh, nothing, takes the place of you <eos> And I write this letter <eos> It's raining on my windowpane <eos> Oh, I feel the need of you <eos> Because without you nothing seems the same <eos> And I write this letter <eos> It's raining on my windowpane <eos> Oh, I feel the need of you <eos> Becausе without you nothing seems the same <eos> So I'll wait until you're homе <eos> Again I'll love you but I am all alone <eos> Oh my darling, I'm so blue <eos> Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you <eos>

Hay momentos que quisiera verte, pero <eos> Creo que así es mejor, no verte es mejor <eos> Fuiste la única persona con la que podía ser yo, mi amor ahora ya acabó <eos> Ya acabó todo ese tiempo tan bonito <eos> Por qué creo que siento que ya no te necesito junto a mí <eos> Junto a mí <eos> Y al carajo todos esos besos que me regalaste porque <eos> Ve la situación en la que dejaste a mi corazón por ti <eos> Ya acabó todo eso lindo que te di <eos> Te vas mija <eos> De mí no quedo lo que pasó entre tú y yo, todo te di <eos> Pero en fin <eos> Recuerdo cuando salías y en mis brazos te dormías aún <eos> Ahora ya acabo <eos> Ya acabó todo ese tiempo tan bonito porque creo que <eos> Siento que ya no te necesito junto a mí, junto a mí <eos> Y ya vi que hasta lo subes en la foto de tu estado <eos> Si ni fotos mías tienes tu teléfono llenado, en fin <eos> Hoy ya soy feliz <eos> Ya acabó todo eso lindo que te di <eos> Ya acabó todo eso lindo que te di <eos> 
Colgados, enamorados <eos> Aqui estamos como dos perros sin dueño <eos> Esta noche es imposible tener sueño <eos> Seguro, pegados <eos> En plena calle <eos> Parecemos como dos recien casados <eos> Cuando todos los amigos se han largado <eos> Cansados <eos> (coro) <eos> Completamente enamorados <eos> Alucinando con nosotros dos <eos> Sintiendo morbo por primera vez <eos> Y por primera vez tocandonos <eos> Completamente enamorados <eos> Como borrachos yo no se de que <eos> Entre las sombras de los arboles <eos> Nos desvestimos para amarnos bien <eos> Para amarnos bien(4) <eos> Compenetrados, estamos enamorados <eos> Matados de tanta risa <eos> Con la luna resbalando por la espalda <eos> Tu te pones mi camisa yo tu falda <eos> Felices <eos> (coro) <eos> Para amarnos bien(4) <eos> Compenetrados, estamos enamorados <eos> (coro) <eos> 
You've got to change your evil ways... baby <eos> Before I stop loving you <eos> You've go to change... baby <eos> And every word that I say, it's true <eos> You've got me running and hiding <eos> All over town <eos> You've got me sneaking and peeping <eos> And running you down <eos> This can't go on... <eos> Lord knows you got to change... baby <eos> When I come home... baby <eos> My house is dark and my pots are cold <eos> You're hanging ëround... baby <eos> With jean and joan and a who knows who <eos> I'm getting tired of waiting and fooling around <eos> I'll find somebody, who won't make me feel like a clown <eos> This can't go on... <eos> Lord knows you got to change <eos> Organ solo: <eos> (repeat 2nd verse) <eos> Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... <eos>

What good's a highway without a destination? <eos> What good's a house without someone to come home to? <eos> What's a night at the top of the world without you there beside me? <eos> No, there ain't no good in it without you <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos> Still got the tendency to lean over the edges <eos> I still got the urge to chase the dream until it ends <eos> You don't fence me in <eos> Yeah, you understand <eos> But when I can't remember <eos> You remind me who I am <eos> You settle me down when I go too far <eos> When I burn too fast, when I lose my way <eos> Hold onto me, whisper to my soul <eos> Put my heart at ease when I'm 'bout to break <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Always got the wind at my back <eos> But you still love me when I live like that <eos> Open my eyes, keep me around <eos> Pull me back in and settle me down <eos> Follow me, I need you right now <eos> Cover me up <eos> And settle me down <eos> Settle me down <eos> 
Dile que bailando te conocí <eos> Cuéntale <eos> Dile que esta noche me quieres ver <eos> Cuéntale <eos> Cuéntale que beso mejor que él <eos> Cuéntale <eos> Dile que esta noche tú me va' a ver <eos> Cuéntale <eos> Cuéntale que te conocí bailando <eos> Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él <eos> Cuéntale, que te traigo loca <eos> Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver <eos> Cuéntale que te conocí bailando <eos> Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él <eos> Cuéntale, que te traigo loca <eos> Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver <eos> Que quizás fue la noche la que te traicionó <eos> O el perfume de mi piel lo que te cautivó <eos> Que ya no tienes excusa' pa' tu traición <eos> Que tuviste mil motivos, que entre en razón <eos> Que quizás te hablo al oído como ya él no <eos> O en mí arde el fuego de la pasión <eos> Ya no le mientas más y admite tu error <eos> Y si es por mí no pidas perdón <eos> Digo, queda de ti el que lo perdones <eos> El que lo olvides o lo abandones <eos> Porque con llorar no se compone <eos> Entonces a mí dame otra noche <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Ay, que yo no te boté) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Aunque tú vuelvas con él) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Cuéntale, cuéntale) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Que beso mejor que él) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Cuéntale, cuéntale) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> Cuéntale, que te conocí bailando <eos> Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él <eos> Cuéntale, que te traigo loca <eos> Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver <eos> Cuéntale, que te conocí bailando <eos> Cuéntale, que soy mejor que él <eos> Cuéntale, que te traigo loca <eos> Cuéntale, que no lo quieres ver <eos> Que quizás fue la noche la que te traicionó <eos> O el perfume de mi piel lo que te cautivó <eos> Que ya no tienes excusa pa' tu traición <eos> Que tuviste mil motivos, que entre en razón <eos> Que quizás te hablo al oído como ya él no <eos> O en mí arde el fuego de la pasión <eos> Ya no le mientas más y admite tu error <eos> Y si es por mí no pidas perdón <eos> Digo, queda de ti el que lo perdones <eos> El que lo olvides o lo abandones <eos> Porque con llorar no se compone <eos> Entonces a mi dame otra noche <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Ay, que yo no te boté) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Aunque tu vuelvas con él) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Cuéntale, cuéntale) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Que beso mejor que él) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> (Cuéntale, cuéntale) <eos> Otra, otra noche, otra <eos> 
And I'd give up forever to touch you <eos> 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow <eos> You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be <eos> And I don't wanna go home right now <eos> And all I can taste is this moment <eos> And all I can breathe is your life <eos> And sooner or later, it's over <eos> I just don't wanna miss you tonight <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming <eos> Or the moment of truth in your lies <eos> When everything feels like the movies <eos> Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> And I don't want the world to see me <eos> 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand <eos> When everything's made to be broken <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> I just want you to know who I am <eos> 
You say you want to cry <eos> But your tears are dry <eos> When I was that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Now my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos> Still I wonder why <eos> Why he had to die <eos> When I feel that way <eos> There's nothing left to say <eos> Nothing left to say <eos> Still my lady's on fire <eos> She wants to tear it down <eos> She knows you're a liar <eos> My lady's on fire <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no <eos> No, no, no, no, no" <eos> She said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no" <eos>

If I was a Beatle I'd sing about yesterday <eos> If I was James Taylor I'd sing about fire and rain <eos> If I was Elvis I'd sing about my shoes <eos> But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you <eos> If I was Hank Williams it'd be about heartache and pain <eos> If I was Tom Petty I'd sing about Mary Jane <eos> If I was Ole Willie I'd sing about eyes that are blue <eos> But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you <eos> 'Cause you are the perfect melody <eos> You are every note I'd sing <eos> Every word I'd write <eos> Even when I'm out of tune <eos> All I can be is me <eos> And sing about you <eos> If I was Jimmy Buffett I'd sing about swimmin' <eos> If I was a Stone it'd be about honky tonk women <eos> If I was Ole Blue Eyes I'd sing fly me to the moon <eos> But since I'm just me, I'd sing about you <eos> 'Cause you are the perfect melody <eos> And you are every note I'd sing <eos> Every word I'd write <eos> Even when I'm out of tune <eos> All I can be is me <eos> And sing about you <eos> Layla, Amanda, Maggie May, and June <eos> The only thing missin' is <eos> You are the perfect melody <eos> And you are every note I'd sing <eos> Every word I'd write <eos> Even when I'm out of tune <eos> All I can be is me <eos> And I'd sing about you <eos> All I care to be is me <eos> Singin' 'bout you <eos> You know I'd sing about you <eos>

The desert dust it fills your eyes <eos> The rattlesnake shake takes you by surprise <eos> The coyotes sing in the calm of night <eos> The cactus water goes down like fire <eos> The City of Angels ain't too far from here <eos> And when I need some sin, it's always near <eos> The Caliente warms my bones <eos> And the Valley of Death is a skeleton's home <eos> The desert toad takes me for a ride <eos> The Lizard King's always by my side <eos> The hawk and eagle just want to fly <eos> But the horizon's hot and the air is dry <eos> The venom stings from the scorpion <eos> And the owl watches where I've been <eos> My lips are cracked from the howlin' wind <eos> I need to quench my thirst and heal my skin <eos> The mountains like painting <eos> The Joshua Tree <eos> Gram died in room eight and left it all to Keith <eos> Just a couple of miles from the Salton Sea <eos> But a little closer to heaven for someone like me, woo <eos>

Clone, <eos> caught hold of your flood lung, <eos> harbour your ‘someone’, <eos> prevent me. <eos> Shown, <eos> you swoon in your lace run, <eos> brooding, a quilt tongue, <eos> pining me. <eos> Calm, <eos> clot, cold, and bleed <eos> Bone, <eos> pull over your midriff, <eos> labour your inches, <eos> widow me. <eos> Hone, <eos> all crimson and hinges, <eos> tarot and itches, <eos> corner me. <eos> Faux <eos> shot, sold and bleed <eos> cower all your cinders, fake us <eos> bower in your shivers, shake us. <eos> 
Can you feel it, see it, hear it today? <eos> If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway <eos> You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast <eos> And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass <eos> It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright <eos> It's so groovy, it's outta sight <eos> You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet <eos> But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet <eos> You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor <eos> So you lay down on it and you do it some more <eos> You've got to share it, so you dare it <eos> Then you bare it and you tear it <eos> You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin <eos> It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win <eos> It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain <eos> It's sad, it happened, and it's a shame <eos> You want it all, but you can't have it (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> It's in your face, but you can't grab it (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <eos> What is it?

Uuh <eos> Sugar pie, honey bunch <eos> You know that I love you <eos> I can't help myself <eos> I love you and nobody else <eos> In and out my life (In and out my life) <eos> You come and you go (You come and you go) <eos> Leaving just your picture behind <eos> And I kissed it a thousand times <eos> When you snap your finger or wink your eye <eos> I come a-running to you <eos> I'm tied to your apron strings <eos> And there's nothing that I can do (Uuh) <eos> Can't help myself (Noo) <eos> No, I can't help myself (Ooh) <eos> Can't <eos> Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch) <eos> I'm weaker than a man should be <eos> I can't help myself <eos> I'm a fool in love you see <eos> Wanna tell you I don't love you <eos> Tell you that we're through <eos> And I've tried but every time I see your face <eos> I get all choked up inside <eos> When I call your name <eos> Girl, it starts the flame <eos> Burning in my heart, tearing it all apart <eos> No matter how I try, my love I cannot hide <eos> 'Cause sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch) <eos> You know that I'm weak for you (Weak for you) <eos> Can't help myself <eos> I love you and nobody else (Uuh) <eos> Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch) <eos> Do anything you ask me to (Ask me to) <eos> Can't help myself <eos> I want you and nobody else (Uuh) <eos> Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch) <eos> You know that I love you (Love you) <eos> I can't help myself <eos> No, I can't help myself (Uuh) <eos> Sugar pie, honey bunch (Sugar pie, honey bunch) <eos> You know that I'm weak for you <eos> 
It's been way too long for me to find it this hard <eos> Sitting alone my fingers picking the sofa apart <eos> An attempt to distract from the fact that I miss you <eos> I wonder if your friends have had to carry you home <eos> And stay for the night because <eos> They don't want to leave you alone <eos> Way before it was fun, it's becoming an issue <eos> I know it's cruel <eos> But I kind of hope you're tortured too <eos> Tell me does your heart stop <eos> At the party when my name drops <eos> Like you're stood at the platform <eos> When the trains cross <eos> Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be <eos> Or is it just me? <eos> Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside <eos> When I say that we broke up and they ask why <eos> Are you crying in the shower like a freak? <eos> Or is it just me? <eos> It's been three months and two days and five hours <eos> Since I walked away and we left it so sour, I know <eos> That you're probably thinking you're better without me <eos> And all my days have turned cold but not as cold as your shoulder <eos> I've been thinking it over, while I drink myself sober again <eos> Please understand <eos> That I know it's cruel <eos> But I kind of hope you're tortured too <eos> Tell me does your heart stop <eos> At the party when my name drops <eos> Like you're stood at the platform <eos> When the trains cross <eos> Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be <eos> Or is it just me? <eos> Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside <eos> When I say that we broke up and they ask why <eos> Are you crying in the shower like a freak? (Hmm, hmm) <eos> Or is it just me? <eos> (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> 'Cause this would be one whole lot easier (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> God, I know that's selfish but it's true (Ah, ah, ah) <eos> If underneath some calm exterior <eos> You're all fucked up too <eos> Tell me does your heart stop <eos> At the party when my name drops <eos> Like you're stood at the platform <eos> When the trains cross <eos> Are you hurting? Yeah, you must be <eos> Or is it just me? <eos> Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside <eos> When I say that we broke up and they ask why <eos> Are you crying in the shower like a freak? <eos> With only cigarettes for company? <eos> Are you crying in the shower like a freak? <eos> Or is it just me? <eos>

The first time the devil looked into my eyes <eos> I knew that he was out to get me <eos> There was no disguise <eos> He's always hiding behind <eos> Nunca me quedo en un solo sitio <eos> Te amaré pero solo visito, ah <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> The first time I heard the galaxy speak <eos> It was between you and me <eos> Now we both have to flee <eos> I can't ever stay in only one place <eos> But in the city of nightmares we both embrace <eos> I used too much of my magic <eos> This will only end so tragically <eos> All the pretty sad boys want to fall in love with me <eos> I don't really want to show you what I'm feeling <eos> My reality's been something that I'm dreaming <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> Mi magia te ha cambiado, yo lo siento <eos> Siempre cambio yo me muevo como el viento <eos> I belong to the universe, I belong to the universe <eos> I don't belong to anyone else, no <eos> I'm in love with the universe <eos> Oh no, no, no, no, no <eos> Na na na na na na no <eos> Na na na na no <eos> I don't belong to anyone else <eos>

Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine <eos> Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything <eos> When she gets that "come get me" look in her eyes <eos> Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild <eos> When she drives me wild <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out <eos> Till she changes her mind <eos> Says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV" <eos> And she falls asleep <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> She's unpredictable, unforgettable <eos> It's unusual, unbelievable <eos> How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her <eos> Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me <eos> The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances <eos> And wears her heart on her sleeve <eos> Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy <eos> But her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> Her crazy's beautiful to me <eos> 
Esperé en el lugar de costumbre <eos> Y en mis manos un ramo de rosas para regalarte <eos> Pero tu no llegaste a la cita <eos> Solamente mandaste una carta marcada de un beso <eos> No la abrí, me quedé pensativo <eos> Y mis lágrimas se confundieron con gotas de lluvia <eos> Al mirar que era la despedida <eos> Porque ya no querías que siguiéramos como amantes <eos> (Coro) <eos> Quiero tenerte cerca de mi cariño... <eos> Regresa amor <eos> Mi vida ya no tiene ningún sentido <eos> Sin tu calor <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Amor <eos> (Coro) <eos> Quiero tenerte cerca de mi cariño... <eos> Regresa amor <eos> Mi vida ya no tiene ningún sentido <eos> Sin tu calor <eos> Quiero tenerte cerca de mi cariño <eos> Regresa amor <eos> Mi vidsa ya no tiene ningún sentido <eos> Sin tu calor <eos> Regresa a mí <eos> Amor <eos> 
I’ve feared the deepest darkest secrets that live inside of me <eos> Defeat and tragedy, walking in shame, finding nowhere to hide <eos> I’ve thrown my bottles of guilt into the sea <eos> Hoping the waves carry them away from me <eos> Oh <eos> My heart is beating. I’ll never stop fighting. I’ll keep breathing <eos> My heart is beating. I’ll never stop fighting. I’ll keep breathing to stay alive <eos> And here I go, off to make a change <eos> I’m screaming, screaming revival <eos> All of my strength, all of my might <eos> Will go into this to take back my life <eos> All of my strength, all of my might <eos> Will go back into this to take back my life <eos> My life, my life, my life <eos> I’m taking back my life <eos> My life, my life, my life, taking back my life <eos> Let’s go.... <eos> This song is music to my ears <eos> This song is music <eos> And is a new production on an old stage <eos> On an old stage <eos> I won’t dwell in unhappiness <eos> I will not dwell in <eos> Grasping humility, asking forgiveness <eos> Tomorrow is gone, I’ll start living for today <eos> I’ll never stop the fighting and I’ll take it all away <eos> Tomorrow is gone, I’ll start living for today <eos> I’ll never stop the fighting and I’ll take it away <eos> 
People keep on learning <eos> Soldiers keep on warring <eos> World keep on turning <eos> 'Cause it won't be too long <eos> Powers keep on lying <eos> While your people keep on dying <eos> World keep on turning <eos> 'Cause it won't be too long <eos> I'm so darn glad he let me try it again <eos> Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin <eos> I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then <eos> Going to keep on trying <eos> 'Til I reach my highest ground <eos> Teachers keep on teaching <eos> Preachers keep on preaching <eos> World keep on turning <eos> 'Cause it won't be too long <eos> Oh no <eos> Lovers keep on loving <eos> Believers keep on believing <eos> Sleepers just stop sleeping <eos> 'Cause it won't be too long <eos> Oh no <eos> I'm so glad that he let me try it again <eos> 'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin <eos> I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then <eos> Going to keep on trying <eos> 'Til I reach my highest ground <eos> Woo <eos> 'Til I reach my highest ground <eos> No one's going to bring me down <eos> Oh no <eos> 'Til I reach my highest ground <eos> Don't you let nobody bring you down (They'll sho 'nuff try) <eos> God is gonna show you highest ground <eos> He's the only friend you'll have around <eos> 'Cause the rest of the world will bring you down <eos> 
Desnuda canta la mañana gris <eos> Que será de mi amor perdido <eos> No siento nada si no estás aquí <eos> Eres mi fuente, mi pan, mi vino <eos> Quiero sembrar de flores tu jardín <eos> Amanecer enredado en tu pelo <eos> De pronto fue cuando comprendí <eos> Que sin tu amor el cielo no era el cielo <eos> CORO <eos> Y fui buscando tus besos, en otros besos <eos> En otras manos, en otro lecho <eos> Y me sentí vagabundo, en otro mundo <eos> Un ser extraño, sin amor (x2) <eos> CORO <eos> El frío invierno pronto llegará <eos> Las hojas del otoño han caído <eos> Todo está triste porque tu no estás <eos> Deja que sea tu mejor amigo <eos> Hoy por la calle solo sin tu amor <eos> Me perderé si tu no estás conmigo <eos> Yo no sabía que mi corazón <eos> Lo daba todo por estar contigo <eos> CORO <eos> 
Think about it, there must be higher love <eos> Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above <eos> Without it, life is wasted time <eos> Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on <eos> Facing our fear and standing out there alone <eos> A yearning and it's real to me <eos> There must be someone who's feeling for me <eos> Things look so bad everywhere <eos> In this whole world, what is fair? <eos> We walk blind and we try to see <eos> Falling behind in what could be <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> A good kind of love, want a higher love <eos> I will wait for it <eos> I'm not too late for it <eos> Until then, I'll sing my song <eos> To cheer the night along <eos> Bring it, oh <eos> I could light the night up with my soul on fire <eos> I could make the sun shine from pure desire <eos> Let me feel that love come over me <eos> Let me feel how strong it could be <eos> Oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh I said bring me <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love <eos> Bring me a higher love, oh <eos>

I bet you have never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say <eos> "Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of running away <eos> Settling down, would you marry me <eos> If I asked you twice and begged you pretty please?" <eos> She'd have said yes in a New York minute <eos> They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it <eos> He just stole a kiss as he rode away <eos> He never hung his hat up <eos> At Kitty's place <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should've been a cowboy <eos> I might've had a sidekick with a funny name <eos> Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James <eos> Ending up on the brink of danger <eos> Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers <eos> Go west, young man, haven't you been told <eos> California's full of whiskey, women and gold <eos> Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars <eos> With a dream in my eye, and a prayer in my heart <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> Wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should have been a cowboy <eos> I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should've learned to rope and ride <eos> I'd be wearing my six-shooter, riding my pony on a cattle drive <eos> Stealing the young girls' hearts <eos> Just like Gene and Roy <eos> Singing those campfire songs <eos> Oh, I should have been a cowboy <eos> Yeah, I should've been a cowboy <eos> I should have been a cowboy <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> 
Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> S'envole une chanson <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Elle est née d'aujourd'hui <eos> Dans le cœur d'un garçon <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Marchent des amoureux <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Leur bonheur se construit <eos> Sur un air fait pour eux <eos> Sous le pont de Bercy <eos> Un philosophe assis <eos> Deux musiciens quelques badauds <eos> Puis les gens par milliers <eos> Sous le ciel de Paris <eos> Jusqu'au soir vont chanter <eos> Hum Hum <eos> L'hymne d'un peuple épris <eos> De sa vieille cité <eos> Près de Notre Dame <eos> Parfois couve un drame <eos> Oui mais à Paname <eos> Tout peut s'arriver <eos> Quelques rayons <eos> Du ciel d'été <eos> L'accordéon <eos> D'un marinier <eos> L'espoir fleurit <eos> Au ciel de Paris <eos> Et le ciel de Paris <eos> A son secret pour lui <eos> Depuis vingt siècles il est épris <eos> De notre Île Saint Louis <eos> Quand elle lui sourit <eos> Il met son habit bleu <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Quand il pleut sur Paris <eos> C'est qu'il est malheureux <eos> Quand il est trop jaloux <eos> De ses millions d'amants <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Il fait gronder sur nous <eos> Son tonnerr' éclatant <eos> Mais le ciel de Paris <eos> N'est pas longtemps cruel <eos> Hum Hum <eos> Pour se fair' pardonner <eos> Il offre un arc en ciel <eos> 
Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Tell me, tell me what you really want from me <eos> You've got to let me know <eos> I'm falling off and I need you terribly <eos> One down and one to go <eos> Volcano girls we really can't be beat <eos> Warm us up and watch us blow <eos> But now and then we fail and we admit defeat <eos> We're falling off, we are watered down and fully grown <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> A million miles of running and I hit the wall <eos> I bounce back and I run some more <eos> But this is it, I'm giving up, I'm calling quits <eos> So get down and meet me on the floor <eos> Way to go, way to flip off everyone <eos> I steal your thunder then I try to bolt <eos> But I could stand a little pity now and then <eos> I'm falling off, I am watered down and fully grown <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go, I don't wanna go <eos> I told you 'bout the seether before <eos> You know, the one that's neither or nor <eos> Well, here's another clue if you please <eos> The seether's Louise <eos> One, two, three, whoa <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me <eos> Lying here <eos> 'Cause I don't wanna go <eos> Leave me, leave me, leave me <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go, I don't wanna <eos> Go! <eos>

Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says "Virginia is for lovers" <eos> Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other <eos> He said "All you're really given is the sunshine and your name" <eos> We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos> Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me <eos> Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely? <eos> Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.? <eos> Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway? <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos> You'll find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought <eos> We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not <eos> Sometimes you got to <eos> Get along, on down the road <eos> We've got a long long way to go <eos> Scared to live, scared to die <eos> We ain't perfect but we try <eos> Get along while we can <eos> Always give love the upper hand <eos> Paint a wall, learn to dance <eos> Call your mom, buy a boat <eos> Drink a beer, sing a song <eos> Make a friend, can't we all get along <eos> 
I'm constantly bridging <eos> All my answers make it worse <eos> Explaining myself <eos> Feeling like this trial won't ever end <eos> Now, a minute of silence <eos> There's red in the valley, was it worth it? <eos> If existing is worthless <eos> Then biding time is a K.O fight <eos> I'm out, I'm out, wake me now <eos> I'm out, I'm out <eos> I'm out, I'm out, wake me <eos> How can you call it a win? <eos> We're down in our luck, don't you save us <eos> We call it violence <eos> Down and out, don't come and save us yet <eos> (I'm out, I'm out) <eos> (I'm out, I'm out) <eos> (I'm out) <eos> I'm out, I'm out, wake me now <eos> I'm out, I'm out <eos> I'm out, I'm out, wake me <eos> How can you call it a win? <eos> We're down in our luck, don't you save us <eos> We call it violence <eos> Down and out, don't come and save us yet <eos> Toughen up, we were bound to love <eos> We're breaking a calling trust <eos> Waster, so bad, it's us <eos> I'm bad enough <eos> So call it off, we don't run <eos> How can you call it a win? <eos> When we're bound to love, we'll lose again <eos> How can you call it a win? <eos> We're down in our luck, don't you save us <eos> We call it violence <eos> Down and out, don't come and save us yet <eos> 
You load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> (Spoken) <eos> Yes, sir, there's many a Kentucky coal miner that pretty nearly owes his soul to the company store. He gets so far in debt to the coal company he's a-workin' for that he goes on sometimes for years without bein' paid one red cent in real, honest-to-goodness money. But he can always go to the company store and draw flickers or scrip. You know, that's little brass coins that you can't spend nowhere, only at the company store. So they add that against his account. And every day, he gets a little farther in debt. Sounds pretty bad, but even that's got a brighter side to it <eos> Now some people say a man's made out of mud <eos> But a poor man's made outta muscle and blood <eos> Muscle and blood, skin and bones <eos> A mind that's weak and a back that's strong <eos> You load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> Well, I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine <eos> I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mines <eos> Loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal <eos> And the straw boss a-hollered "Well, bless my soul!" <eos> Sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain <eos> Fightin' and trouble is my middle name <eos> I was raised in the bottoms by a mama hound <eos> I'm mean as a dog, but I'm gentle as a lamb <eos> I load sixteen tons and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> Well, if you see me comin', you better step aside <eos> A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died <eos> I got a fist of iron and a fist of steel <eos> If the right one don't get you, then the left one will <eos> You load sixteen tons, and what do you get? <eos> You get another day older and deeper in debt <eos> St. Peter, don't you call me, 'cause I can't go <eos> I owe my soul to the company store <eos> 
Oh, what a night <eos> Late December, back in '63 <eos> What a very special time for me <eos> As I remember, what a night <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> You know, I didn't even know her name <eos> But I was never gonna be the same <eos> What a lady, what a night <eos> Oh, I <eos> I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room <eos> And I <eos> As I recall, it ended much too soon <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Hypnotizing, mesmerizin' me <eos> She was everything I dreamed she'd be <eos> Sweet surrender, what a night <eos> And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder <eos> Spinning my head around <eos> And takin' my body under <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Oh, I <eos> I got a funny feeling <eos> When she walked in the room <eos> And I <eos> As I recall, it ended much too soon <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> Why'd it take so long to see the light? <eos> Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right <eos> What a lady, what a night <eos> Oh <eos> And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder <eos> Spinning my head around <eos> And takin' my body under <eos> Oh, what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos> (Do do do do do, do do do do) Oh what a night <eos>

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care <eos> But it's so cold and I don't know where <eos> I brought you daffodils in a pretty string <eos> But they won't flower like they did last spring <eos> And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright <eos> I'm just so tired to share my nights <eos> I wanna cry and I wanna love <eos> But all my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up, up <eos> And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight <eos> But my hands been broken one too many times <eos> So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude <eos> Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose <eos> And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours <eos> But I sang 'em all to another heart <eos> And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love <eos> But all my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up, up <eos> (Oh, need a love, now, my heart is thinking of) <eos> I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours <eos> But I sang 'em all to another heart <eos> And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love <eos> But all my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up <eos> On another love, another love <eos> All my tears have been used up, up <eos>

Uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her uptown world <eos> I bet she's never had a backstreet guy <eos> I bet her momma never told her why <eos> I'm gonna try for an <eos> Uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> And when she knows what she wants from her time <eos> And when she wakes up and makes up her mind <eos> She'll see I'm not so tough <eos> Just because I'm in love with an <eos> Uptown girl <eos> You know I've seen her in her uptown world <eos> She's getting tired of her high class toys <eos> And all the presents from her uptown boys <eos> She's got a choice <eos> Uptown girl <eos> You know I can't afford to buy her pearls <eos> But maybe someday when my ship comes in <eos> She'll understand what kind of guy I've been <eos> And then I'll win <eos> And when she's walking, she's looking so fine <eos> And when she's talking, she'll say that she's mine <eos> She'll say I'm not so tough <eos> Just because I'm in love with an <eos> Uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> Uptown girl, she's my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love with an uptown girl, my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love with an uptown girl <eos> 
Now the oceans have drained out <eos> Can I come up for air? <eos> 'Cause I've been learning to live without <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> I wasn't ready for the rapture, we're only passing through <eos> But these words, they mean nothing to me <eos> I know that time will mend this fracture, I've been lost in a maze <eos> And every route I take, leads right back to you <eos> Now the oceans have drained out <eos> Can I come up for air? <eos> 'Cause I've been learning to live without <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> Now the skies have been blacked out <eos> I've got to find my way <eos> 'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> I've been searching through the wreckage <eos> But it's like standing in the eye of a storm <eos> When will I finally get the message? <eos> Some things are broken beyond repair <eos> This is my cross to bear <eos> My own meaningless catastrophe <eos> I never had the time to prepare <eos> Because I never knew that all my nightmares could come true <eos> Now the oceans have drained out <eos> Can I come up for air? <eos> 'Cause I've been learning to live without <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> Now the skies have been blacked out <eos> I've got to find my way <eos> 'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> I've spent my fair share <eos> In the deepest depths of despair <eos> 'Cause I was too lost down there to care <eos> I wasn't braced for the fallout <eos> I wasn't braced for the fallout <eos> I've been searching through the wreckage <eos> But it's like standing in the eye of a storm <eos> When will I finally get the message? <eos> Some things are broken beyond repair <eos> Now the oceans have drained out <eos> Can I come up for air? <eos> 'Cause I've been learning to live without <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> Now the skies have been blacked out <eos> I've got to find my way <eos> 'Cause it's been raining but there's a drought <eos> And I'm fighting with broken bones <eos> 
I still sit around thinking <eos> Wondering what you've been up to <eos> And if you're happy now <eos> Sure looks like she loves you <eos> And the 'what could've been's' <eos> Are always what I come back to <eos> Like it's always been you <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> I realise, it doesn't do me any good <eos> To dream about the good times <eos> And a part of me knows it was the right thing to say goodbye <eos> But I lie awake at night <eos> I toss and turn and wonder why <eos> In hindsight <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> 'Cause I miss how, could've worked out <eos> But I had my doubts, they all seem stupid now <eos> It's so bittersweet <eos> I could've had it all <eos> It was everything I need <eos> But I thought I wanted more <eos> Now she's lying in your arms <eos> It fits so perfectly <eos> And it still breaks my heart <eos> Was it meant, was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos> Was it meant to be me? <eos>

Somewhere past tomorrow is better than it seems <eos> The life you're livin' dreamed <eos> If you're ever broken, there's always an open door <eos> A beacon towards the shore <eos> Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light <eos> Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side <eos> So get up off your knees, hope is still alive <eos> That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find <eos> 'Cause the stars are on your side <eos> Yeah, the stars are on your side <eos> If you're holdin' breath, tired and you're frail <eos> Just exhale <eos> Know you're bound for glory <eos> And that all is never lost <eos> No mater the cost <eos> Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light <eos> Sometimes you need fire to see through the other side <eos> So get up off your knees, hope is still alive <eos> That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find <eos> 'Cause the stars are on your side <eos> Yeah, the stars are on your side <eos> Sometimes it takes darkness to feel a little light <eos> Sometimes you need fire to see the other side <eos> So get up off your knees, hope is still alive <eos> That place you're searchin' for, I know you'll find <eos> 'Cause the stars are on your side <eos> Yeah, the stars are on your side <eos> 
Je ne rêve plus, je ne fume plus, je n'ai même plus d'histoire <eos> Je suis sale sans toi, je suis laid sans toi <eos> Je suis comme un orphelin dans un dortoir <eos> Je n'ai plus envie de vivre ma vie, ma vie cesse quand tu pars <eos> Je n'ai plus de vie et même mon lit <eos> Se transforme en quai de gare quand tu t'en vas <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> T'arrives on ne sait jamais quand, tu r'pars on ne sait jamais où <eos> Et ça va faire bientôt deux ans que tu t'en fous <eos> Comme à un rocher, comme à un péché, je suis accroché à toi <eos> Je suis fatigué, je suis épuisé <eos> De faire semblant d'être heureux quand ils sont là <eos> Je bois toutes les nuits mais tous les whiskys, pour moi, ont le même goût <eos> Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau <eos> Je ne sais plus où aller, tu es partout <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Je verse mon sang dans ton corps <eos> Et je suis comme un oiseau mort quand toi, tu dors <eos> Je suis malade, parfaitement malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Pourtant, moi, j'avais du talent avant ta peau <eos> Cet amour me tue, si ça continue, je crèverai seul avec moi <eos> Près de ma radio, comme un gosse idiot <eos> Écoutant ma propre voix qui chantera <eos> Je suis malade, complètement malade <eos> Comme quand ma mère sortait le soir <eos> Et qu'elle me laissait, seul avec mon désespoir <eos> Je suis malade, c'est ça, je suis malade <eos> Tu m'as privé de tous mes chants, tu m'as vidé de tous mes mots <eos> Et j'ai le cœur complètement malade <eos> Cerné de barricades, t'entends ? Je suis malade ! <eos>

Darkness comes, daylight goes <eos> You wait forever even if I don't <eos> Summer rain, sleepless nights <eos> In any weather, I'm safe inside <eos> Your arms now, I'm found <eos> In your arms, there's solid ground <eos> When I feel like a castle in the sand <eos> And I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> When I can't find the answers in the wind <eos> And I falter, you pick me up again <eos> (Fall down, you pick me up again) <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> From risin' sea to settin' sun <eos> We'll be together, forever young <eos> In the dead of night, when thundеr rolls <eos> Crawl under covers and hold me closе <eos> In your arms now, I'm found <eos> In your arms, there's solid ground <eos> When I feel like a castle in the sand <eos> And I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> When I can't find the answers in the wind <eos> Then I falter, you pick me up again <eos> (I falter, you pick me up again) <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> You're all I need <eos> When I can't stand on my own two feet <eos> And I'm on my knees <eos> I know whenever I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up again (You pick me up again) <eos> When I feel like a castle in the sand <eos> And I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> When I can't find the answers in the wind <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up <eos> When I fall down, you pick me up again <eos> 
I fall to pieces <eos> Each time I see you again <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> How can I be just your friend? <eos> You want me to act like we've never kissed <eos> You want me to forget (to forget) <eos> Pretend we've never met (never met) <eos> And I've tried and I've tried, but I haven't yet <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Each time someone speaks your name (speaks your name) <eos> I fall to pieces <eos> Time only adds to the flame <eos> You tell me to find someone else to love <eos> Someone who'll love me too (love me too) <eos> The way you used to do (used to do) <eos> But each time I go out with someone new <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> You walk by and I fall to pieces <eos> 
Contemplating what's gonna be <eos> Wondering which way to turn <eos> Lotta things left to be learned <eos> Complicating silly old me <eos> The things I hold on to <eos> Just let it go & see what it do <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we want to see <eos> Just what we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> Fantasizing having myself a ball <eos> Staring up at the big screen <eos> Problem is I'm the only one <eos> Who's seen it <eos> Realizing it's not like that at all <eos> Time to come down to Earth <eos> & feel what it's really worth <eos> There's no guarantee <eos> In this thing called life <eos> Sometimes we wanna see <eos> Just want we think is right <eos> It all comes down to love <eos> Where do we go from here <eos> Let's take it slow no fear <eos> What we don't know becomes clear <eos> Baby let's go somewhere <eos> 
We're waiting for collapse <eos> In the cold and lonely mirror <eos> Reflections all you see <eos> Of the world you made on your own with no mercy <eos> And they call you a liar <eos> But you won't surrender <eos> And they can choose to run <eos> With hypocrisy <eos> It happens every day <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> The revolution lives <eos> In the beat of our hearts and the burning sound of the flames we started in <eos> Can you hear it now? Can you feel the hurt? <eos> This silent hate <eos> And they worship a liar <eos> But we won't surrender <eos> And we won't ever run <eos> From the pain you see <eos> Because now we're free <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> 
Some people don't know when to quit, and that's why they quit <eos> Some need to hit the bottom to see they got a problem, they can't handle it <eos> But that ain't why I started cleaning up my life <eos> Wish it was, but, ooh, that would be a lie <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over (There ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Oh, no, no, no <eos> All those bottles sitting up on the shelf are just salt on the wound <eos> One sip and I'm picking up the phone tryin' not to go home without you <eos> And that ain't nothin' but a whole lotta pain <eos> And that kind of hurt, ooh hurts, it ain't worth another drink <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl <eos> No, no, no <eos> Baby, can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me can't get over you, no <eos> Can't get over you, oh, no, no, no <eos> I've been sober 'cause there ain't no hangover like you, no, no, no <eos> Can you come over? <eos> I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah <eos> Girl, every time you do <eos> I just end up, head all messed up like the sheets where we made love <eos> I've been sober since you broke my heart in two <eos> 'Cause drunk me, yeah drunk me, yeah drunk me <eos> Can't get over you, no (there ain't no hangover like you) <eos> Can't get over, can't get over <eos> (There ain't no hangover like you), oh, no, no, no <eos>

One, one, one, one, one <eos> Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy <eos> (Out of my mind, out of my mind) <eos> Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me <eos> (Too many times, too many times) <eos> My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else <eos> But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself <eos> One: Don't pick up the phone <eos> You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone <eos> Two: Don't let him in <eos> You'll have to kick him out again <eos> Three: Don't be his friend <eos> You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning <eos> And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards <eos> (Nowhere to turn, no way) <eos> (Nowhere to turn, no) <eos> Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern <eos> (I never learn, I never learn) <eos> But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself <eos> I do, I do, I do <eos> One: Don't pick up the phone <eos> You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone <eos> Two: Don't let him in <eos> You'll have to kick him out again <eos> Three: Don't be his friend <eos> You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning <eos> And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> Practice makes perfect <eos> I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em) <eos> Eat, sleep, and breathe it <eos> Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I (I got new) <eos> One: Don't pick up the phone (yeah) <eos> You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (alone) <eos> Two: Don't let him in (uh-ooh) <eos> You'll have to kick him out again (again) <eos> Three: Don't be his friend <eos> You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning <eos> And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> (Whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa) <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> I got new rules, I count 'em <eos> (Baby, you know I count 'em) <eos> I gotta tell them to myself <eos> Don't let him in, don't let him in <eos> Don't, don't, don't, don't <eos> Don't be his friend, don't be his friend <eos> Don't, don't, don't, don't <eos> Don't let him in, don't let him in <eos> Don't, don't, don't, don't <eos> Don't be his friend, don't be his friend <eos> Don't, don't, don't, don't <eos> You're gettin' over him <eos> 
Hallé una flor un día en el camino <eos> Que apareció marchita y deshojada <eos> Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro <eos> Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla <eos> Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos <eos> A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma <eos> Recuperó el color que había perdido <eos> Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que nadie le robe el color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas <eos> Nació el amor que un día se había perdido <eos> Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra <eos> Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que siempre este cerca de mí <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Le fui brindando cariño, un poquito de amor <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Y en el invierno llenó mi jardín de color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Ay, cuando la vi, me enamoré y me la llevé, me la llevé <eos> ¡Avemaría! <eos> ¡Puerto Rico! <eos> Jajaja <eos> ¡Ataca, Sergio <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> ¡Esto sigue! <eos> 
We get some rules to follow <eos> That and this, these and those <eos> No one knows <eos> We get these pills to swallow <eos> How they stick in your throat <eos> Tastes like gold <eos> Oh, what you do to me <eos> No one knows <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> I journey through the desert <eos> Of the mind with no hope <eos> I follow <eos> I drift along the ocean <eos> Dead lifeboat in the sun <eos> End come undone <eos> Pleasantly caving in <eos> I come undone <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> And I realize you're mine <eos> Indeed a fool am I <eos> Heaven smiles above me <eos> What a gift here below <eos> But no one knows <eos> A gift that you give to me <eos> No one knows <eos> Ustedes que son padres de familia... <eos> …Buenas tardes señores y señoritas aquí está el <eos> "DJ Héctor Bonifacio Echevarría Cervantes de la Cruz Arroyo Rojas" <eos> Esta es la radio Quetzalcoatl <eos> Estación donde el rock vive y no muere <eos> Vamos a escuchar un par de temas de Queens of the Stone Age <eos> Primero vamos a escuchar "First It Giveth..." <eos> ...qué música impresionante temible y verdaderamente ahora van a ver a ver a ver a ver aquí va aquí va aquí va aquí va… <eos> 
Who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> And who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> Who can say why your heart sighs <eos> As your love flies? Only time <eos> And who can say why your heart cries <eos> When your love lies? Only time <eos> Who can say when the roads meet? <eos> That love might be in your heart? <eos> And who can say when the day sleeps <eos> If the night keeps all your heart? <eos> Night keeps all your heart <eos> Who can say if your love grows <eos> As your heart chose? Only time <eos> And who can say where the road goes? <eos> Where the day flows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> Who knows? Only time <eos> 
I can see every time I look into your eyes <eos> You don't care a thing about those other guys <eos> Without words, you made me understand what's on your mind <eos> The rhythm of your body next to mine <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot <eos> Love's either right or it's wrong <eos> Feels so good, love you a lot <eos> Right here beside me is where you belong <eos> I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel <eos> Until the dream of holding you is real <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Ooh-ooh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> Oh-oh, I can tell by the way you dance <eos> That you're gonna love me tonight <eos> 
Yeah, I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Pulling away from all my sins <eos> Tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> I don't wanna leave you lonely but I've got to <eos> 'Cause it's only the things I need to prove <eos> To you and everybody else <eos> That scares me so damn much <eos> I can't take it I'm not strong <eos> It's probably best that I move on <eos> Get outta here, fade away <eos> That's why I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> And tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Everybody's gotta die somehow <eos> Why not for me right now, right now <eos> Well, I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Drunk driving again <eos> I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> Tell my mother I lovе her and take care of my friеnds <eos> 'Cause I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Yeah, I'm drunk driving again <eos> 
There is hope for us <eos> There is distance between you and I <eos> We have just enough <eos> And it comes as no surprise <eos> I was in between <eos> You were matches and kerosene <eos> Is your conscience clear? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Did you celebrate without me? <eos> Did you tell them all about me? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Does it get you off <eos> To get it off your chest? <eos> Such an awful year <eos> Such an awful mess <eos> You can't write <eos> You can't sing <eos> You can't do anything at all <eos> Is there someone here? <eos> Can you make the call? <eos> Please, make the call <eos> And the ambulance is here <eos> And if I haven't made it clear... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Is there hope for us? <eos> There are constants that we can't define <eos> Is it all used up? <eos> Are we out of time? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> Well, if you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Now, the ambulance is here <eos> And if I still haven't made it clear <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos>

A man walks down the street <eos> He says, "Why am I soft in the middle, now? <eos> Why am I soft in the middle? <eos> The rest of my life is so hard <eos> I need a photo-opportunity <eos> I want a shot at redemption <eos> Don't want to end up a cartoon <eos> In a cartoon graveyard" <eos> Bonedigger, Bonedigger <eos> Dogs in the moonlight <eos> Far away in my well-lit door <eos> Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly <eos> Get these mutts away from me <eos> You know, I don't find this stuff amusing anymore <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> I can be your long lost pal <eos> I can call you Betty <eos> And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al <eos> A man walks down the street <eos> He says, "Why am I short of attention? <eos> Got a short little span of attention <eos> And, whoa, my nights are so long <eos> Where's my wife and family? <eos> What if I die here? <eos> Who'll be my role model <eos> Now that my role model is gone, gone?" <eos> He ducked back down the alley <eos> With some roly-poly little bat-faced girl <eos> All along, along <eos> There were incidents and accidents <eos> There were hints and allegations <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> I can be your long lost pal <eos> I can call you Betty <eos> And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al <eos> Call me Al <eos> A man walks down the street <eos> It's a street in a strange world <eos> Maybe it's the third world <eos> Maybe it's his first time around <eos> Doesn't speak the language <eos> He holds no currency <eos> He is a foreign man <eos> He is surrounded by the sound, the sound <eos> Cattle in the marketplace <eos> Scatterlings and orphanages <eos> He looks around, around <eos> He sees angels in the architecture <eos> Spinning in infinity <eos> He says, "Amen and Hallelujah!" <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> I can be your long lost pal <eos> I can call you Betty <eos> And Betty, when you call me, you can call me Al <eos> Call me <eos> Na na na na, na na na na <eos> Na na na na, na na na-na na-na <eos> Na na na na, na-na na-na na na <eos> Na na na na, na na na na <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> I can call you Betty <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> I can call you Betty <eos> If you'll be my bodyguard <eos> 
All the drama and the words <eos> Endless noise reflecting <eos> No value, no substance <eos> In anything you're saying <eos> Confusing a reason <eos> But no one's really listening <eos> Just seeking approval <eos> Desperate to draw attention <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> No substance or logic <eos> Behind a mask you're hiding <eos> Keep reaching for something <eos> Untruthful accusations <eos> Your bullshit is wasted <eos> It only makes us stronger <eos> More proof in our actions <eos> Can stand by what we are doing <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Die behind your mask <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos> The true voice, our music <eos> It's always been our music <eos> Can't speak to our faces <eos> It's easy to put your mask on <eos> The typing and bitching <eos> It's how you keep your distance <eos> There's always a reason <eos> We've moved beyond your limits <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos> A life in disguise, it's all a dream <eos> Look at me, it's so predictable <eos> With your head bowed down <eos> It's time to cross these lines <eos> And stand face to face, look at me! <eos> Look at me, look at me! <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos> Hide <eos> Lie <eos> Hide <eos> Take your mask off <eos>

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> It don't matter, anyhow <eos> An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe <eos> If you don't know by now <eos> When your rooster crows at the break of dawn <eos> Look out your window and I'll be gone <eos> You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on <eos> Don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> That light I never knowed <eos> An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe <eos> I'm on the dark side of the road <eos> Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say <eos> To try and make me change my mind and stay <eos> We never did too much talkin' anyway <eos> So don't think twice, it's all right <eos> I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe <eos> Where I'm bound, I can't tell <eos> But goodbye's too good a word, gal <eos> So I'll just say fare thee well <eos> I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind <eos> You could have done better but I don't mind <eos> You just kinda wasted my precious time <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> Like you never did before <eos> It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal <eos> I can't hear you any more <eos> I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road <eos> I once loved a woman, a child I'm told <eos> I give her my heart but she wanted my soul <eos> But don't think twice, it's all right <eos>

Tapping time with one good finger <eos> I got this girlfriend and she's a swinger <eos> We make plans and then we head out to <eos> San Bernardino <eos> We get gas at the local P & M <eos> Buy a coke in a can made of tin <eos> We drink fast because <eos> We're headed out west to San Bernardino <eos> And we shall miss Carolina <eos> And the east coast as opposed to the west <eos> We won't shed any tears though <eos> Nor even be sad because we know <eos> The western desert is the best! <eos> I filled a bag with cigarettes and apple wine <eos> We'll hit the road again at 10 minutes to 9 <eos> Me and this girl I think she's pregnant <eos> And we're headed to San Bernardino <eos> And then when we hit Texas <eos> We'll stop in Amarillo for a bite to eat <eos> We'll stop on over in Dallas <eos> And visit my friend but we can't stay <eos> For more than a week <eos> I've got the south in my veins <eos> But California in my mouth <eos> And that's the simple reason <eos> Why i'm leaving the south <eos> Me and this girl and she's so foxy <eos> And we're heading to San Bernardino <eos> Whoo <eos> That was close we crossed the Tennessee state border <eos> They would've locked us up by the sheriff's order <eos> Yes we're freaks <eos> But they can't touch us out west <eos> In San Bernardino <eos>

Too many slaves in this world <eos> Die by torture and pain <eos> Too many people do not see <eos> They're killing themselves, going insane <eos> Too many people do not know <eos> Bondage is over the human race <eos> They believe slaves always lose <eos> And this fear keeps them down <eos> Watch the damned (God bless ya) <eos> They're gonna break their chains (hey) <eos> No, you can't stop them (God bless ya) <eos> They're coming to get you <eos> And then you'll get your <eos> Balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall, balls to the wall <eos> You may screw their brains <eos> You may sacrifice them, too <eos> You may mortify their flesh <eos> You may rape them all <eos> One day the tortured will stand up <eos> And revolt against the evil <eos> They'll make you drink your blood <eos> And tear yourself to pieces <eos> You better watch the damned (God bless ya) <eos> They're gonna break their chains (hey) <eos> No, you can't stop them (God bless ya) <eos> They're coming to get you <eos> And then you'll get your <eos> Balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall, balls to the wall <eos> Come on man, let's stand up all over the world <eos> Let's plug a bomb in everyone's ass <eos> If they don't keep us alive, we're gonna fight for the rights <eos> Build a wall with the bodies of the dead, and you're saved <eos> Make the world scared, come on, show me the sign of victory <eos> Sign of victory, sign of victory <eos> You better watch the damned (God bless ya) <eos> They're gonna break their chains (hey) <eos> No, you can't stop them (God bless ya) <eos> They're coming to get you <eos> And then you'll get your <eos> Balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> Balls to the wall <eos> You'll get your balls to the wall, man <eos> 
I need you, Christmas <eos> Friends by the fire to hold <eos> Times have been lonely <eos> And lately, I just feel alone <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Family with nowhere to go <eos> Angels on treetops and angels in the snow <eos> Oh, the cold <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I know <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> You don't ever change <eos> I miss the feeling <eos> Waiting for Santa to show <eos> Caroling late night <eos> And all the children's eyes aglow <eos> I need you, Christmas <eos> Oh, how I miss you the most <eos> Greetings from loved ones <eos> And lovers under mistletoe <eos> Oh, oh, oh <eos> If you're young, if you're old <eos> We all wait to be told <eos> Just a simple phrase <eos> "Have a Merry Christmas" <eos> Ooh, ooh <eos> Christmas, ooh, ooh, ooh <eos> Seasons change, come and go <eos> But there's one thing I hope <eos> You'll just stay the same <eos> 'Cause I need you, Christmas <eos> 
One, two <eos> When he was young you'd not find him doing well in school <eos> His mind would turn unto the waters <eos> Always the focus of adolescent ridicule <eos> He has no time for farmer’s daughters <eos> Alienated from the clique society <eos> A lonely boy finds peace in fishing <eos> His mother says, "John this is not the way life's supposed to be <eos> Don't you see the life that you are missing?" <eos> And he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> Now years gone by, we find a man that rules the sea <eos> He sets out on a dark May morning <eos> To bring his catch back to this small community <eos> He doesn’t see the danger dawning <eos> Four hours up, oh, the ocean swelled and swelled <eos> The fog rolled in, it started raining <eos> The starboard bow, oh my god, we're going down <eos> They do not hear his frantic mayday <eos> As he says <eos> When I grow up I want to be <eos> One of the harvesters of the sea <eos> I think before my days are done <eos> I want to be a fisherman <eos> I'll live and die a fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> Call him John the fisherman <eos> We call him John the fisherman <eos> 
The childhood part of my life <eos> It wasn't very pretty <eos> You see, I was born and raised <eos> In the slums of the city <eos> It was a one room shack that slept <eos> Ten other children beside me <eos> We hardly had enough food <eos> Or room to sleep <eos> It was hard times <eos> Needed something to ease <eos> My troubled mind <eos> Mmm, listen <eos> My father didn't know <eos> The meaning of work <eos> He disrespected Mama <eos> And treated us like dirt <eos> I left home seeking a job <eos> That I never did find <eos> Depressed and downhearted <eos> I took to Cloud Nine <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Listen, one more time <eos> I'm doing fine <eos> Up here, on Cloud Nine <eos> Folks down there tell me <eos> They say, "Give yourself a chance, son <eos> Don't let life pass you by <eos> But the world of reality is a rat race <eos> Where only the strongest survive <eos> It's a dog-eat-dog world <eos> And that ain't no lie <eos> Listen, it ain't even safe no more <eos> To walk the streets at night" <eos> I'm doing fine on Cloud Nine <eos> Let me tell you about Cloud Nine <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And every man, every man is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> And you're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> Cloud Nine <eos> I wanna say I love the life I live <eos> And I'm gonna live the life I love <eos> Up here on Cloud Nine <eos> I-I-I-I-I, I'm riding high <eos> (On Cloud Nine) <eos> You're as free as a bird in flight <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> There's no difference between day and night <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> It's a world of love and harmony <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Reality) I wanna sail upper, higher <eos> Upper, up, up, and away <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You ain't got no responsibility <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> Every man in his mind is free <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You're a million miles from reality <eos> (Cloud Nine) <eos> You can be what you wanna be <eos>

Sister cries out, from her baby bed <eos> Brother runs in, feathers on his head <eos> Mama's in her room learnin' how to sew <eos> Daddy's drinkin' beer, listenin' to the radio <eos> Hank Williams sings Kaw-Liga and Dear John <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> Sister's using rouge and clear complexion soap <eos> Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope <eos> Mama is depressed, barely makes a sound <eos> Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town <eos> Bob Dylan sings "Like a Rolling Stone" <eos> And time marches on, time marches on <eos> The South moves north, North moves south <eos> A star is born, a star burns out <eos> The only thing that stays the same is <eos> Everything changes, everything changes <eos> Sister calls herself a sexy grandma <eos> Brother's on a diet for high cholesterol <eos> Mama's out of touch with reality <eos> Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree <eos> As the angels sing an old Hank Williams song <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos> Time marches on, time marches on <eos>
