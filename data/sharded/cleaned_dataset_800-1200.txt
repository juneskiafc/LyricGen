When you were here before <eos> Couldn't look you in the eye <eos> You're just like an angel <eos> Your skin makes me cry <eos> You float like a feather <eos> In a beautiful world <eos> I wish I was special <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I don't care if it hurts <eos> I wanna have control <eos> I want a perfect body <eos> I want a perfect soul <eos> I want you to notice <eos> When I'm not around <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> I wish I was special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> Oh, oh <eos> She's running out the door <eos> She's running out <eos> She run, run, run, run <eos> Run <eos> Whatever makes you happy <eos> Whatever you want <eos> You're so fuckin' special <eos> I wish I was special <eos> But I'm a creep <eos> I'm a weirdo <eos> What the hell am I doing here? <eos> I don't belong here <eos> I don't belong here <eos>

Rosas sobre el mantel <eos> Que no te dicen nada <eos> Y yo derramando miel <eos> Y tú me das la espalda <eos> ¿Y si te olvido? <eos> No estoy en posición pa’ decidirlo <eos> Pero tanto te he callado que me mata <eos> Que me mata <eos> Que me mata <eos> ¿Pero cómo te digo? <eos> (¿Cómo yo te digo?) <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> Rosas siempre a tus pies <eos> Pisadas <eos> Te lloro un río en el cóctel <eos> (Martini extra wet) <eos> Tal vez cuando pasen más de diez años <eos> Y no lo pienses demasiado <eos> Te des cuenta quién estuvo a tu lado <eos> ¿Pero cómo te digo? <eos> (¿Cómo yo te digo?) <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo? <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos> ¿Cómo te digo baby? <eos> ¿Cómo? Dímelo <eos>

It's not a silly little moment <eos> It's not the storm before the calm <eos> This is the deep and dying breath of <eos> This love that we've been working on <eos> Can't seem to hold you like I want to <eos> So I can feel you in my arms <eos> Nobody's going to come and save you <eos> We pulled too many false alarms <eos> We're going down <eos> And you can see it, too <eos> We're going down <eos> And you know that we're doomed <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> I was the one you always dreamed of <eos> You were the one I tried to draw <eos> How dare you say it's nothing to me? <eos> Baby, you're the only light I ever saw <eos> I'll make the most of all the sadness <eos> You'll be a bitch, because you can <eos> You try to hit me, just to hurt me <eos> So you leave me feeling dirty <eos> 'Cause you can't understand <eos> We're going down <eos> And you can see it, too <eos> We're going down <eos> And you know that we're doomed <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> Go cry about it, why don't you? <eos> My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Burning room <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> Don't you think we ought to know by now? <eos> Don't you think we should have learned somehow? <eos> 
Only the victim remains the victim <eos> While the truth slips thru the system <eos> Yet the goodness never sees the light of day <eos> So we fight for what is right <eos> Against injustice day and night <eos> To achieve this goal that's the only way <eos> Somebody's colorful <eos> Someone is faceless <eos> Someone is powerful <eos> Somebody's tasteless <eos> This one, that one, the other one <eos> We all are beautiful let's face it <eos> If you ask my name <eos> I'll the youth same, Justice! <eos> We're looking for truth <eos> To save all the youth, Justice! <eos> To stop the radical way of strife <eos> Which matters to every life <eos> Then we'll see the end of all that is wrong <eos> Change your mindset <eos> Change the laws <eos> Change your concept <eos> Even the flaws <eos> So together, we can all stand tall <eos> Somebody's colorful <eos> Someone is faceless <eos> Someone if powerful <eos> Somebody's tasteless <eos> This one, that one, the other one <eos> We all are beautiful let's face it <eos> We can change it <eos> If you ask me my name <eos> I'll tell you the same, Justice! <eos> We're looking for truth <eos> To save all the youth, Justice! <eos> Let's make up our mind <eos> We don't have much time, Justice! <eos> There's no one to blame, we are all the same, Justice! <eos> : <eos> Yeah from Ferguson to Baton Rough <eos> There's a target on your back if you're Black or a Latin dude <eos> Women can get it too <eos> These animals don't have a clue <eos> They'll pack you in a pine box while they're back in their black and blues <eos> Hiding behind a badge <eos> Alibi is ironclad <eos> While children are dying fast <eos> Treated like expired trash (yeah!) <eos> There no substance <eos> We call it JUSTICE <eos> No rhyme or reason or purpose <eos> Why they murk these kids <eos> More than excessive force <eos> It'll take your breath of course <eos> He didn't have a weapon <eos> But he's aggresively stepping towards <eos> Trigger happy savages <eos> Targeting inner city inhabitants <eos> Our so called authority is embarrassing maaan!! <eos> Go get the Kerosene can <eos> And burn it down again <eos> Ain't no comparison <eos> This land is drowning in <eos> Racist rhetoric in the fact of true, Justice! <eos> It's really JUST US <eos> RAISE UP A CLUTCHED FIST <eos> THIS ISN'T JUSTICE <eos> THIS SHIT'S DISGUSTING <eos>

Digamos, que te creo <eos> Que te arrepientes <eos> Pero es diferente a que te perdone <eos> Seré buena gente, pero no tu pendejo <eos> Yo no me dejo <eos> Y yo sé que te van a dar ganas de <eos> Besar mi boca una vez más <eos> Pero por tu culpa, ¿sabes cuándo va a pasar? <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Vuelves a dormir conmigo <eos> Yo en cualquier esquina me hallo una de tu tipo <eos> Tú que encuentres otro igual, eso sí va a estar canijo <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Me dirijas la palabra <eos> Me caen en la punta las personas que son falsas <eos> No te pongas a llorar, déjate de payasadas <eos> Tú ya me perdiste, lo mejor es que te vayas <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Vuelves a dormir conmigo <eos> Yo en cualquier esquina me hallo una de tu tipo <eos> Tú que encuentres otro igual, eso sí va a estar canijo <eos> En tu perra vida <eos> Me dirijas la palabra <eos> Me caen en la punta las personas que son falsas <eos> No te pongas a llorar, déjate de payasadas <eos> Tú ya me perdiste, lo mejor es que te vayas <eos>

Sensory waves in tune <eos> With this overwhelming feeling we despise <eos> Permeates through the skin <eos> Numb the sense and quiet all the questions why, why? <eos> Somebody wake me up from this daydream <eos> Run in place <eos> Until the life is all but drained from my veins <eos> A crack in the sequence, no reprise <eos> Living on borrowed time <eos> I'll stay 'till it's over, right by your side <eos> We're living their stories in disguise <eos> We see no reflections in our dream lives <eos> 
I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own bedsheets <eos> I've been waking up alone, I haven't thought of her for days <eos> I'll be honest, it's better off this way <eos> But every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been tryin' but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remembеr you're gone, baby, it's just the song on thе radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> I'll be honest, I'm alright with me <eos> Sunday mornings, in my own white tee <eos> I've been waking up alone <eos> I haven't thought of him for days <eos> I'll be honest <eos> It's better off this way <eos> Every time I think that I can get you out my head <eos> You never ever let me forget 'cause <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio <eos> Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go <eos> And I've been trying, but I just can't fight it <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> And I've been trying but I just can't fight it (Ooh) <eos> When I hear it I just can't stop smiling (Ooh) <eos> I remember you're gone, baby, it's just the song on the radio <eos> That we used to know <eos> 
Well, when I was a young man, never been kissed <eos> I got to thinkin' it over- how much I had missed <eos> So I got me a girl and I kissed her and then <eos> Oh, lordy, well I kissed 'er again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well I asked her to marry and to be my sweet wife <eos> I told her we'd be so happy for the rest of our life <eos> I begged and I pleaded like a natural man <eos> And then, whoops oh lordy, well she gave me her hand <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well we worked very hard, both me and my wife <eos> Workin' hand-in-hand to have a good life <eos> We had corn in the field and wheat in the bin <eos> And then, whoops oh lord, I was the father of twins <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well our children, they numbered just about four <eos> And they all had a sweetheart a'knockin' on the door <eos> They all got married and they wouldn't hesitate <eos> I was, whoops oh lord, the grandfather of eight <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm, mmm, kisses sweeter than wine <eos> (Sweeter than wine) <eos> Well now that I'm old and I'm a'ready to go <eos> I get to thinkin' what happened a long time ago <eos> Had a lot of kids, a lot of trouble, and pain <eos> But then, whoops oh lordy, well I'd do it all again <eos> Because she had kisses sweeter than wine <eos> She had, mmm kisses sweeter than wine <eos>

Hey, mom, I know we're gettin' old <eos> And the lines on our hands have changed <eos> But you still look at me the same <eos> Hey, mom, guess what? You're really tough <eos> And I know you did all you could <eos> Just to make sure my life was good <eos> Sorry for the fights and the tone of my voice <eos> Sorry for the nights when I made the wrong choice <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go to the mall and buy some shoes <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey, dad, what's up? Miss you so much <eos> Yeah, the shade of your hair has changed <eos> But I look up to you the same <eos> Taught me how to fish, taught me how to ride a bike <eos> Taught me how to love, how to treat a woman right <eos> Life is flyin' by and it's hittin' me now <eos> I hope it's not, but <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Then let's do the things we always do <eos> Like go for a drive or watch the news <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Hey you, sit back <eos> Don't go so fast <eos> If this is the last time, please come close <eos> I love you with all my heart, you know <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> So let's do the things we always do <eos> Or maybe we try something brand new <eos> I don't wanna cry, I'm bad at goodbye <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> If this is the last time <eos> Oh, if this is the last time <eos> 
Intéressé(e) par l'explication des paroles de cette chanson ou d'autres ? Venez faire l'analyse des textes avec nous ! <eos> Y a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans <eos> Y veut t'piquer ta pelle et ton seau <eos> Ta couche-culotte avec les bombecs dedans <eos> Lolita défends-toi, fous-y un coup d'rateau dans l'dos <eos> Attends un peu avant d'te faire emmerder <eos> Par ces p'tits machos qui pensent qu'à une chose <eos> Jouer au docteur non conventionné <eos> J'y ai joué aussi je sais de quoi j'cause <eos> J'les connais bien les play-boys des bacs à sable <eos> J'draguais leur mère avant d'connaître la tienne <eos> Si tu les écoutes y t'f'ront porter leur cartable <eos> Heureusement qu'j'suis là, que j'te r'garde et que j't'aime <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Comme j'en ai marre de m'faire tatouer des machins <eos> Qui m'font comme une bande dessinée sur la peau <eos> J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés <eos> Un par un, plantés dans le cuir de mon blouson dans l'dos <eos> T'es la seule gonzesse que j'peux t'nir dans mes bras <eos> Sans m'démettre une épaule sans plier sous ton poids <eos> Tu pèses moins lourd qu'un moineau qui mange pas <eos> Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas <eos> Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes <eos> Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat <eos> Tu risques d'donner faim à un tas de p'tits mecs <eos> Quand t'iras à l'école si jamais t'y vas <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> Qu'est-ce tu m'racontes ? Tu veux un petit frangin ? <eos> Tu veux qu'j't'achète un ami Pierrot ? <eos> Eh ! Les bébés ça s'trouve pas dans les magasins et j'crois pas <eos> Que ta mère voudra qu'j'lui fasse un p'tit dans l'dos <eos> Ben quoi Lola on est pas bien ensemble ? <eos> Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux ? <eos> T'entends pas ce bruit c'est le monde qui tremble <eos> Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux <eos> Allez viens avec moi j't'embarque dans ma galère <eos> Dans mon arche y'a d'la place pour tous les marmots <eos> Avant qu'ce monde devienne un grand cimetière <eos> Faut profiter un peu du vent qu'on a dans l'dos <eos> Lola <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> J'suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j'suis pas <eos> Tu sais ma môme que j'suis morgane de toi <eos> 
I don't love her <eos> I tried to tell myself <eos> But you can see it in my eyes <eos> So don't deny <eos> I can't fool no one else <eos> The truth is in the tears I cry <eos> 'Cause... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> I told her I'd never fall in love <eos> But now I know better <eos> How does it feel <eos> I can't describe this feeling <eos> That came when I saw her last night <eos> She got to me <eos> I'll let you know the reason <eos> I saw her with another guy <eos> So... <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> And if it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Maybe she'll take me back <eos> (Hey, girl, he's begging) <eos> I made a big mistake <eos> (Won't you forgive him, girl) <eos> Now I can feel it <eos> (He's never felt before) <eos> I really love her <eos> (You love her?!?! What?!?!) <eos> It took my heart <eos> To shatter in a thousand pieces <eos> Before I'd ever drop my pride <eos> (Oh, oh, oh, oh) <eos> Losing love worrying about my image <eos> Really helped me realize <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (On my mind all the time) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (She stays on my mind, mind, mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (Why does it hurt so bad?) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> (If it isn't love) <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> (If it isn't, I can't describe this feeling that I feel for her) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why do I feel this way? <eos> Why does she stay on my mind? <eos> (Stay on my mind) <eos> If it isn't love <eos> Why does it hurt so bad? <eos> Make me feel so sad inside <eos> If it isn't love <eos> If it isn't love <eos> 
Well I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos> They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried <eos> It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid <eos> They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did <eos> Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town <eos> I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around <eos> I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me <eos> Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee <eos> Daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand <eos> I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band <eos> Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away <eos> There ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave <eos> I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze <eos> I can see him half stoned pickin` up the Lovesick Blues <eos> When Clayton died I made him a promise <eos> I was gonna carry on somehow <eos> I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now <eos> I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos> Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried <eos> Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do <eos> But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too <eos> Yeah I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died <eos> 
Uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her uptown world <eos> I bet she never had a back street guy <eos> I bet her mama never told her why <eos> I'm gonna try for an uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> And when she knows what <eos> She wants from her time <eos> And when she wakes up <eos> And makes up her mind <eos> She'll see I'm not so tough <eos> Just because <eos> I'm in love with an uptown girl <eos> You know I've seen her in her uptown world <eos> She's getting tired of her high-class toys <eos> And all her presents from her uptown boys <eos> She's got a choice <eos> Uptown girl <eos> You know I can't afford to buy her pearls <eos> But maybe someday when my ship comes in <eos> She'll understand what kind of guy I've been <eos> And then I'll win <eos> And when she's walking <eos> She's looking so fine <eos> And when she's talking <eos> She'll say that she's mine <eos> She'll say I'm not so tough <eos> Just because <eos> I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> She's been living in her white bread world <eos> As long as anyone with hot blood can <eos> And now she's looking for a downtown man <eos> That's what I am <eos> Uptown girl <eos> She's my uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> You know I'm in love <eos> With an uptown girl <eos> My uptown girl <eos> 
Well, I just don't get it <eos> Hell, I just don't see <eos> How one five-foot-two blue-eyed girl <eos> Could wreck a guy like me <eos> So here I am on a back porch <eos> It's looking like I'm stuck <eos> 'Tween a case of Rolling Rock and a heartache <eos> It's gonna be the end of one of us <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> She might have my UT hoodie <eos> She got the last word in that goodbye <eos> But I'm killing these cans 'cause I'll be damned <eos> If she's gonna get my Saturday night <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> Can down <eos> There's one more buried down deep in that ice <eos> But I'm leaving no can left behind, so I <eos> I pick one up, crack it open, and put it to my lips <eos> I tip it back, take a sip, 'cause if <eos> It's gonna be my heart or these double-Rs <eos> Crushed up on the ground <eos> Can down <eos> Can down <eos> (Can down) <eos> (Can down) <eos> 
Another night slowly closes in <eos> And I feel so lonely <eos> Touching heat freezing on my skin <eos> I pretend you still hold me <eos> I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep <eos> I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you <eos> I can't believe you're gone <eos> You were the first, you'll be the last <eos> Wherever you go, I'll be with you <eos> Whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> Whenever you need someone <eos> To lay your heart and head upon <eos> Remember, after the fire, after all the rain <eos> I will be the flame <eos> I will be the flame <eos> Watching shadows move across the wall <eos> I feel so frightened <eos> I wanna run to you, I wanna call <eos> But I've been hit by lightning <eos> Just can't stand up for fallin' apart <eos> Can't see through this veil across my heart, over you <eos> You'll always be the one <eos> You were the first, you'll be the last <eos> Wherever you go, I'll be with you <eos> Whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> Whenever you need someone <eos> To lay your heart and head upon <eos> Remember after the fire, after all the rain <eos> I will be the flame <eos> I will be the flame <eos> I'm going crazy, I'm losing sleep <eos> I'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over you <eos> You'll always be the one <eos> You were the first, you'll be the last <eos> Wherever you go, I'll be with you <eos> Whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> Whenever you need someone <eos> To lay your heart and head upon <eos> Remember, after the fire, after all the rain <eos> I will be the flame <eos> I will be the flame <eos> Whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> Wherever you go, I'll be with you <eos> And whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> Oh! Whatever you want, I'll give it to you <eos> 
I'm waitin' up, savin' all my precious time <eos> Losin' light, I'm missin' my same old us <eos> Before we learned our truth too late <eos> Resigned to fate, fadin' away <eos> So tell me, can you turn around? <eos> I need someone to tear me down <eos> Oh, tell me, can you turn around? <eos> But either way <eos> Hold me while you wait <eos> I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait) <eos> If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait) <eos> My love, my love, my love, my love <eos> Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait) <eos> Tell me more, tell me something I don't know <eos> Did we come close to havin' it all? <eos> If you're gonna waste my time <eos> Let's waste it right <eos> And hold me while you wait <eos> I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait) <eos> If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait) <eos> My love, my love, my love, my love <eos> Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait) <eos> I wish you cared a little more (Hold me while you wait) <eos> I wish you'd told me this before (Hold me while you wait) <eos> My love, my love, my love, my love <eos> Won't you stay a while? (Hold me while you wait) <eos> This is you, this is me, this is all we need <eos> Is it true? My faith is shaken, but I still believe <eos> This is you, this is me, this is all we need <eos> So won't you stay a while? <eos> And hold me while you wait <eos> I wish that I was good enough (Hold me while you wait) <eos> If only I could wake you up (Hold me while you wait) <eos> My love, my love, my love, my love <eos> Won't you stay a while?

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear <eos> I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears <eos> You really had me going, wishing on a star <eos> But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far <eos> I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn <eos> It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born <eos> There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide <eos> You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why <eos> I say goodbye <eos> 'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air <eos> Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care <eos> And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day <eos> I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay <eos> And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? <eos> I used to be so certain and I can't figure out <eos> What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain <eos> There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame <eos> Will it ever change? <eos> 'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air <eos> Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care <eos> And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day <eos> I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay <eos> But I'm thinking it over anyway <eos> I'm thinking it over anyway <eos> I've come to find I may never know <eos> Your changing mind, is it friend or foe <eos> I rise above or sink below <eos> With every time you come and go <eos> Please don't come and go <eos> 'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air <eos> Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care <eos> And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day <eos> I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay <eos> But I'm thinking it over anyway <eos> I'm thinking it over anyway <eos> I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear <eos> 
Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea <eos> To the open arms of the sea <eos> Lonely rivers sigh, "Wait for me, wait for me <eos> I'll be coming home, wait for me" <eos> Whoa, my love <eos> My darling <eos> I've hungered, hungered for your touch <eos> A long, lonely time <eos> And time goes by so slowly <eos> And time can do so much <eos> Are you still mine? <eos> I need your love <eos> I need your love <eos> God speed your love to me <eos> 
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> The kids were young and pretty <eos> Where have you been? Where did you go? <eos> Those summer nights seem long ago <eos> And so is the girl you used to call <eos> The Queen of New York City <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> The power of youth is on my mind <eos> Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time <eos> Will you still love me when I shine <eos> From words but not from beauty? <eos> My father's love was always strong <eos> My mother's glamour lives on and on <eos> Yet still inside, I felt alone <eos> For reasons unknown to me <eos> But if you send for me, you know I'll come <eos> And if you call for me, you know I'll run <eos> I'll run to you, I'll run to you <eos> I'll run, run, run <eos> I'll come to you, I'll come to you <eos> I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> And if you call, I'll run, run, run <eos> If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine <eos> Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine <eos> Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine <eos> And we were young and pretty <eos> 
They read you Cinderella <eos> You hoped it would come true <eos> And one day your Prince Charming <eos> Would come rescue you <eos> You like romantic movies <eos> And you never will forget <eos> The way you felt when Romeo <eos> Kissed Juliet <eos> And all this time that you've been waiting <eos> You don't have to wait no more <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I never make a promise <eos> I don't intend to keep <eos> So when I say forever <eos> Forever's what I mean <eos> Well I'm no Cassanova <eos> But I swear this much is true <eos> I'll be holding nothing back <eos> When it comes to you <eos> You dream of love that's everlasting <eos> Well baby open up your eyes <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> If you want tenderness <eos> I got tenderness <eos> And I see through <eos> To the heart of you <eos> If you want a man <eos> Who will understand <eos> You don't have to look very far <eos> I can love you <eos> Girl, I can love you <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I would make you my world <eos> Move heaven and Earth <eos> If you were my girl <eos> I can give you my heart <eos> Be all that you need <eos> Show you you're everything <eos> That's precious to me <eos> If you give me a chance <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can love you like that <eos> I can, I can love you <eos> Always kiss and hug you <eos> Baby be mine <eos> My one and only girl <eos> My heart <eos> My world <eos> You're everything to me <eos> I can, I can love you <eos> If you let me love you <eos> My one girl <eos>

Sunrise. Doggo snorin' <eos> Nothing to do today but it ain't borin' <eos> Shoes on and I'm out the door <eos> Take a run along a foggy shore <eos> Pot of coffee, fill my cup <eos> Pack a bowl and spark it up <eos> Take a bike out to the rock <eos> Swim until my legs are shot <eos> These are the days <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> I need that state of mind <eos> Island time, where everything's slow <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> We can ignore the grind <eos> Island time, where we take it slow <eos> Oh oh <eos> Sunset. Hit the cottage to clean up <eos> Crack open a bottle of the hard stuff <eos> Pre-game then we're out the door <eos> Start a fire on a moonlit shore <eos> Crack a beer and throw it back <eos> Listen as the ocean crashes <eos> Call the crew and hit the bar <eos> Or fall asleep while counting stars <eos> These are the nights <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> I need that state of mind <eos> Island time, where everything's slow <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> We can ignore the grind <eos> Island time, where we take it slow <eos> Oh oh <eos> Only alarm clock that's ringin' is the fog horn that's singin' to me <eos> Only thing I am planning is a nap in the hammock at three <eos> Savor the scene because we're livin' the dream <eos> 'Til it's back to reality <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> I need that state of mind <eos> Island time, where everything's slow <eos> Put me back on island time <eos> We can ignore the grind <eos> Island time, where we take it slow <eos> Oh oh, oh oh <eos> 
How many days did I spend thinking <eos> 'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong? <eos> Lived in the shade you were throwing <eos> 'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone <eos> And I couldn't get away from ya <eos> In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah <eos> Your name on my lips, tongue-tied <eos> Free rent, living in my mind <eos> But then something happened one magical night <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> I forgot that you <eos> Got out some popcorn <eos> As soon as my rep started going down, down, down <eos> Laughed on the school yard <eos> As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground <eos> And I would've stuck around for ya <eos> Would've fought the whole town, so yeah <eos> Would've been right there, front row <eos> Even if nobody came to your show <eos> But you showed who you are, then one magical night <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> I forgot that you <eos> Sent me a clear message <eos> Taught me some hard lessons <eos> I just forget what they were <eos> It's all just a blur <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't <eos> And it was so nice <eos> So peaceful and quiet <eos> I forgot that you existed <eos> I did, I did, I did <eos> It isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference <eos> So, yeah <eos> 
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore <eos> But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before <eos> And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen <eos> And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans <eos> I asked her what's a woman like you doing here <eos> I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer <eos> She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem <eos> And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans <eos> She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls <eos> But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl <eos> So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream <eos> And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans <eos> We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through <eos> I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true <eos> As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed <eos> A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans <eos> In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say <eos> I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways <eos> And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen <eos> That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine <eos> But I know I’ll always remember the time <eos> A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream <eos> And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeans <eos> 
Going through the hills on a night all starry <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Far away I heard a shepherd boy piping <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is come to bring us peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "Tell me, shepherd boy piping tunes so merrily <eos> On the way to Bethlehem <eos> Who will hear your tunes on these hills so lonely <eos> On the way to Bethlehem? <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for the joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is come to bring peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "None may hear my pipes on these hills so lonely <eos> On the way to Bethlehem; <eos> But a King will hear me play sweet lullabies <eos> When I get to Bethlehem." <eos> Angels in the sky came down from on high <eos> Hovered over the manger where the babe was lying <eos> Cradled in the arms of his mother Mary <eos> Sleeping now at Bethlehem <eos> "Where is the new King, shepherd boy piping merrily <eos> Is He there at Bethlehem?" <eos> "I will find Him soon by the star shining brightly <eos> In the sky o'vr Bethlehem." <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the king of Kings <eos> Is come to bring us peace on earth <eos> And He's lying cradled there at Bethlehem." <eos> "May I come with you, shepherd boy piping merrily <eos> Come with you to Bethlehem? <eos> Pay my homage too at the new King's cradle <eos> Is it far to Bethlehem?" <eos> Angels in the sky brought this message nigh: <eos> "Dance and sing for joy that Christ the newborn King <eos> Is born in the stable yonder, born for you and me." <eos> 
I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way <eos> Seems like yesterday <eos> I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away <eos> I've never been the same <eos> I felt the strangest feeling <eos> Like a raging fire it burned <eos> She left, I cried for weeks <eos> And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away <eos> Had to earn my pay <eos> Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say <eos> It only ended up the same way <eos> And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone? <eos> Oh, girl, you answered my question <eos> This time it's working, you've given me new hope <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Love changes everything <eos> I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you <eos> It's got a power of its own <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes the rules from fools to kings <eos> Love changes <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos> (Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho <eos> (Love changes) Let's make love <eos> (Love changes everything) Oh <eos> Love changes, changes everything <eos> Love makes you fly, it can break your wings <eos> Don't forget it, girl (Love changes) <eos> Don't you forget it, baby <eos> Love changes everything <eos>

August afternoon <eos> I can picture you <eos> Walking with your father at your side <eos> In the summer heat <eos> California speaks <eos> Softly like she's making up her mind <eos> And now, as I stand beside you I say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Through your shining eyes <eos> Sweet like Jeffrey Pines <eos> I pretended I could read your thoughts <eos> Now it's just the truth <eos> Seems our hearts have fused <eos> Soldered like the gold your sister brought <eos> And how am I lucky enough to say <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> Loving you, loving you, loving you, loving you <eos> And I said <eos> Baby, isn't it crazy that we are born only to die? <eos> Oh, but lately, I've been counting my stars <eos> 'Cause I will spend my whole life loving you <eos> 
Stupid static buzzing in through the stereo <eos> Smoke blowing in through the patio <eos> I'm right where I was just a week ago <eos> Bartender sliding me a double <eos> Of Jameson, strong, something I've been missing <eos> Got me feeling good and believeing <eos> Believing I'm forgetting the taste <eos> The burn, the sting of you leaving <eos> I'm right where you left me <eos> At the bottom of the bottle <eos> Now I'm drunk, like a fireball lighting me up <eos> Put it to my lips and I feel that rush <eos> Letting 80 proof do what it does <eos> And I'm high, it's rocking me through the night <eos> Keeping me warm, holding me so tight <eos> Finally feeling fine, and then it hits me <eos> I wish you were the whiskey <eos> Straight up waiting by the door when I get off <eos> It's a sure thing I can count on <eos> The truth is coming out a litttle more <eos> And more with every shot <eos> I should've known better <eos> Than to run to the bottle <eos> Now I'm drunk, like a fireball lighting me up <eos> Put it to my lips and I feel that rush <eos> Letting 80 proof do what it does <eos> And I'm high, it's rocking me through the night <eos> Keeping me warm, holding me so tight <eos> Finally feeling fine, and then it hits me <eos> I wish you were the whiskey <eos> Yeah, the whiskey, yeah, oh <eos> The whiskey, yeah, the whiskey, yeah <eos> Well, now I'm all alone <eos> And your memory is hanging over <eos> I should've known better than to think I could trade one for the other <eos> Now I'm drunk, like a fireball lighting me up <eos> Put it to my lips and I feel that rush <eos> Letting 80 proof do what it does <eos> And I'm high, it's rocking me through the night <eos> Keeping me warm, holding me so tight <eos> Finally feeling fine, and then it hits me <eos> I wish you were the whiskey <eos> Yeah, the whiskey, yeah, oh <eos> The whiskey, yeah, the whiskey, yeah <eos> 
No puede haber <eos> Dónde la encontraría <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> No puede haber, desgracia semejante <eos> Otra mujer, igual que tú <eos> Con iguales emociones, con las expresiones <eos> Que en otra sonrisa no vería yo <eos> Con esa mirada atenta a mi indiferencia <eos> Cuando me salía de la situación <eos> Con la misma fantasía, la capacidad <eos> De aguantar el ritmo despiadado oh oh <eos> De mi mal humor, oh oh oh oh <eos> Y me faltan cada noche todas tus manías <eos> Aunque más enormes, eran así las mías <eos> Y me faltan tus miradas porque sé que están allí <eos> Donde yo las puse apasionadas, oh, oh <eos> Justo sobre tí oh oh oh oh <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que, aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más evidente <eos> Otra no puede haber <eos> Si no existe me la inventaré <eos> Parece claro que aún estoy envenenado de tí <eos> Es la cosa más preocupante <eos> 
Woh-oh (Yeah) <eos> Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers) <eos> Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra) <eos> Qué tan loco sería <eos> Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día <eos> Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría <eos> ¿Qué pasaría? <eos> Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho <eos> Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho <eos> Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho' <eos> Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo <eos> Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo <eos> Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo <eos> Navaja doble filo <eos> Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo' <eos> Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba <eos> Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada <eos> Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba <eos> Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya <eos> Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente <eos> Detente, como dice la canción <eos> Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón <eos> Sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela <eos> Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena <eos> Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena <eos> Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas <eos> Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella <eos> Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño <eos> Y el no tenerte me hace daño <eos> Seríamo' la pareja del año <eos> Cuánto te extraño <eos> Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía <eos> Y mis amigos lo sabían <eos> Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías <eos> Yo tenía otra melodía <eos> De lo que resultaría <eos> Maldita monotonía <eos> ¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (Seríamo' la pareja del año) <eos> Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (Con celos) <eos> Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh) <eos> Solo queda ser sincero <eos> Yo te quiero todavía <eos>

Light reflects from your shadow <eos> It is more than I thought could exist <eos> You move through the room <eos> Like breathing was easy <eos> If someone believed me <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> They would be <eos> In love, love, love <eos> And everyday <eos> I am learning about you <eos> The things that no one else sees <eos> And the end comes too soon <eos> Like dreaming of angels <eos> And leaving without them <eos> And leaving without them <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> Love, love, love <eos> And with words unspoken <eos> A silent devotion <eos> I know you know what I mean <eos> And the end is unknown <eos> But I think I'm ready <eos> As long as you're with me <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love with you as I am <eos> Being <eos> As in love, love, love <eos>

I want it to be, like, messy <eos> I'm so insecure, I think <eos> That I'll die before I drink <eos> And I'm so caught up in the news <eos> Of who likes me and who hates you <eos> And I'm so tired that I might <eos> Quit my job, start a new life <eos> And they'd all be so disappointed <eos> 'Cause who am I if not exploited? <eos> And I'm so sick of seventeen <eos> Where's my fucking teenage dream? <eos> If someone tells me one more time <eos> "Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry <eos> And I don't stick up for myself <eos> I'm anxious and nothing can help <eos> And I wish I'd done this before <eos> And I wish people liked me more <eos> All I did was try my best <eos> This the kinda thanks I get? <eos> Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah) <eos> They say these are the golden years <eos> But I wish I could disappear <eos> Ego crush is so severe <eos> God, it's brutal out here <eos> (Yeah) <eos> I feel like no one wants me <eos> And I hate the way I'm perceived <eos> I only have two real friends <eos> And lately, I'm a nervous wreck <eos> 'Cause I love people I don't like <eos> And I hate every song I write <eos> And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart <eos> And I can't even parallel park <eos> All I did was try my best <eos> This the kinda thanks I get? <eos> Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah) <eos> They say these are the golden years <eos> But I wish I could disappear <eos> Ego crush is so severe <eos> God, it's brutal out here <eos> (Yeah) <eos> (Just havin' a really good time) <eos> Got a broken ego, broken heart <eos> (Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here) <eos> And God, I don't even know where to start <eos> 
Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck? <eos> Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest? <eos> (Panic) <eos> (Panic) <eos> There's something strange going on in this room <eos> The walls are melting, I can hear the ceiling screaming to come down <eos> I can't believe we built this room <eos> It was meant to be a sanctuary, not a prison <eos> There's something strange going on in this house <eos> It's like we're pushing all these buttons, trying to start a war <eos> Amongst ourselves, but we don't know what we want <eos> All we know's that we don't want what they want <eos> What we want <eos> What they want <eos> What we want <eos> What we want <eos> Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck? <eos> Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest? <eos> Can you feel your bones ache like there's something within? <eos> Can you feel your blood pumping inside of your skin? <eos> Can you feel it? (Panic) Panic, (Panic) panic <eos> Can you feel it? (Panic) Panic, (Panic) panic <eos> There's something wrong with the castle they're in <eos> Watching over every single move that we make <eos> Try to see past their perfect smiles <eos> They were supposed to be protectors, not o-fucking-ppressors <eos> There's something wrong with the way that they speak <eos> Like the more they take from us, the better off that we'll be <eos> Anything to get power they seek <eos> All I know's that they don't want what we want <eos> What we want <eos> What they want <eos> What we want <eos> What we want <eos> Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck? <eos> Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest? <eos> Can you feel your bones ache like there's something within? <eos> Can you feel your blood pumping inside of your skin? <eos> Can you feel it? (Panic) Panic, (Panic) panic <eos> Can you feel it? (Panic) Panic, (Panic) panic <eos> We don't want what they want <eos> They don't want what we want <eos> We don't want what they want <eos> And they don't care! (Panic!) <eos> Panic, panic <eos> 
I've seen pick up lines and dive bar strangers slow dance <eos> I've seen happy hour 2 for ones turn to one night stands <eos> I've seen neon rebounds <eos> And late-night drunk dials <eos> I've seen that Cinderella fairytale go up in cigarette smoke <eos> I've seen two hearts bet it all and still end up broke <eos> The real thing won't be easy <eos> Yeah, might take a while <eos> But I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I still remember mama walking down the living room stairs <eos> And daddy saying with a smile that's my girl right there <eos> They had their share of ups and downs <eos> And I saw the best, and the worst, and the work and the worth it <eos> To get to that that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> I've had some real close calls <eos> A couple diamond ring thoughts <eos> And enough midnight tears to know what love's not <eos> I want that all in, fallin' <eos> Keep the fire burning like the first time feeling <eos> No matter what if I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Kinda heart open arms <eos> Says forever and will never ever take it back <eos> If I'm gonna love <eos> I'm gonna love somebody like that <eos> Somebody like that <eos> Mmm, somebody like that <eos> Love somebody like that <eos>

Te entregué mi piel <eos> Me mudé en tu ser <eos> Sólo quise ser ésa mujer <eos> (Siempre te cuidé <eos> Nunca te fui infiel <eos> Y te amé, te juro <eos> Como a nadie) <eos> I wanna know <eos> Just let me know <eos> How could you let me walk away? <eos> (I wanna know <eos> I gotta know <eos> How could you just take my love away? <eos> After all that we made <eos> Somebody please explain!) <eos> Te perdiste mi amor y yo <eos> Y yo te estaba amando <eos> (Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know <eos> Dejaste mi cama llorando) <eos> Cada uno perdió lo que muchos no han logrado <eos> Ni soñando <eos> Saliste a buscar <eos> Y no sabían igual <eos> Ésos besos que yo te entregaba <eos> (No pudiste hallar la felicidad <eos> Ésa que tanto deseabas) <eos> I wanna know <eos> Just let me know <eos> How could you let me walk away? <eos> (I wanna know <eos> I gotta know <eos> How could you just take my love away? <eos> After all that we made <eos> Somebody please explain!) <eos> Te perdiste mi amor y yo <eos> Y yo te estaba amando <eos> (Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know <eos> Dejaste mi cama llorando) <eos> Cada uno perdió lo que muchos no han logrado <eos> Ni soñando <eos> Royce <eos> Lady T <eos> Te perdiste mi amor y yo <eos> Y yo te estaba amando <eos> (Te perdiste mi amor and you don’t know <eos> Dejaste mi cama llorando) <eos> Te perdiste mi amor, oh no <eos> Nunca supiste cuándo <eos> Te perdiste mi amor y hoy <eos> Hoy podemos remediarlo <eos> No sé qué nos pasó <eos> ¿por qué no lo intentamos de nuevo? <eos>

I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> Baby I can see you drinking too much <eos> Tipsy 'cause you're sipping on your gold Dutch <eos> Some call it rough <eos> But I just call it low touch <eos> Compliment you as our toes touch <eos> In our Reebok <eos> Heart fermenting as I rolled up <eos> Your knee socks <eos> Your tear drops collect <eos> On the tear of your red top <eos> Love so deep had me hitting bedrock <eos> The lead stops until I get my head on <eos> Liquid love on the rocks <eos> Cuppa tea with some scotch <eos> Describe your day in your socks <eos> I’m addicted to you <eos> A victim of my own plot <eos> Depict a life I forgot <eos> Im sick of writing my wrongs <eos> Illicit love is enough <eos> Drink what is left in my cup <eos> Symbolises when to give up <eos> Somewhere in that is a lesson you can pick up <eos> I’m sick of being such sucker for a kiss of your lips <eos> Tonic and gin <eos> The saga begins <eos> I wanna pretend <eos> Condemned for my sins <eos> Flipping predicaments <eos> Sniffing and cigarettes <eos> Kissing through a silhouette <eos> You’ll soon forget <eos> The moon reflects <eos> The man you used to know <eos> Charmed her by her arm and wit <eos> A rapid growth <eos> A midnight hope <eos> A dip dyed choker <eos> She sips I smoke <eos> Lips I provoke <eos> We risk our moments <eos> Below our noses <eos> Trickle of roses and a pocket full of poems <eos> Baby drinking too much but I guess she knows <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Thinking I adore you <eos> Please will someone pass me a cup <eos> I'm about to bore you <eos> And I don't wanna waste your time <eos> I've been running round in your mind <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> I've been staring at you for a while <eos> Smoking that smoke over there with a smile <eos> I don't know what it is but you've got me in the zone <eos> I don't really wanna get to know you <eos> But we can still have fun yeah <eos> Just us two <eos> I've been drinking way too much <eos> Drinking <eos> Drinking way too much <eos> Baby I can see you drinking too much <eos> (Lately I can see you acting fooling) <eos> Blatant when you're taking aims at Cupid <eos> (But daisies don’t define your lady's tulips) <eos> 
I've been caught stealing; <eos> Once when I was 5... <eos> I enjoy stealing <eos> It's just as simple as that <eos> Well, it's just a simple fact <eos> When I want something <eos> I don't want to pay for it <eos> I walk right through the door <eos> Walk right through the door <eos> Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine <eos> Mine all mine! <eos> My girl, she's one too <eos> She'll go and get her a skirt <eos> Stick it under her shirt <eos> She grabbed a razor for me <eos> And she did it just like that <eos> When she wants something <eos> She don't want to pay for it <eos> She walk right through the door <eos> Walk right through the door <eos> Hey all right! If I get by, it's mine <eos> Mine all mine! <eos> We sat around the pile <eos> We sat and laughed <eos> We sat and laughed and <eos> Waved it into the air! <eos> And we did it just like that <eos> When we want something <eos> We don't want to pay for it <eos> We walk right through the door <eos> Walk right through the door <eos> Hey, all right! If I get by, it's mine <eos> Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine... <eos>

Oh, to see without my eyes <eos> The first time that you kissed me <eos> Boundless by the time I cried <eos> I built your walls around me <eos> White noise, what an awful sound <eos> Fumbling by Rogue River <eos> Feel my feet above the ground <eos> Hand of God, deliver me <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The first time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> Lord, I no longer believe <eos> Drowned in living waters <eos> Cursed by the love that I received <eos> From my brother's daughter <eos> Like Hephaestion, who died <eos> Alexander's lover <eos> Now my riverbed has dried <eos> Shall I find no other? <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> I'm running like a plover <eos> Now I'm prone to misery <eos> The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me <eos> How much sorrow can I take? <eos> Blackbird on my shoulder <eos> And what difference does it make <eos> When this love is over? <eos> Shall I sleep within your bed? <eos> River of unhappiness <eos> Hold your hands upon my head <eos> Till I breathe my last breath <eos> Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me <eos> The last time that you touched me <eos> Oh, will wonders ever cease? <eos> Blessed be the mystery of love <eos> 
So lately, been wondering <eos> Who will be there to take my place? <eos> When I'm gone, you'll need love <eos> To light the shadows on your face <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then between the sand and stone <eos> Could you make it on your own? <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> And maybe I'll find out <eos> A way to make it back someday <eos> To watch you, to guide you <eos> Through the darkest of your days <eos> If a great wave shall fall <eos> And fall upon us all <eos> Then, I hope there's someone out there <eos> Who can bring me back to you <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Run away with my heart <eos> Run away with my hope <eos> Run away with my love <eos> I know now, just quite how <eos> My life and love might still go on <eos> In your heart, in your mind <eos> I'll stay with you for all of time <eos> If I could, then I would <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> Way up high or down low <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could turn back time <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> If I could make you mine <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> I'll go wherever you will go <eos> 
I can still shut down a party <eos> I can hang with anybody <eos> I can drink whiskey and red wine <eos> Champagne all night <eos> Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine <eos> But when I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> I can kiss somebody brand new <eos> And not even think about you <eos> I can show up to the same bar <eos> Hear the same songs in my car <eos> Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard <eos> When I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin' <eos> How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in <eos> When I taste tequila <eos> Baby, I still see ya <eos> Sorority T-shirt <eos> The same one you wore when we were <eos> Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle <eos> Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya <eos> I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I) <eos> When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I) <eos> Ooh <eos>

Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> It's like no other pain I've ever known <eos> To love someone so much, to have no control <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos> But I think I'm lost without you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> 'Cause I've been strong for so long <eos> I never thought how much I needed you <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> Strangers rushing past, just tryna get home <eos> You were the only safe haven that I've known <eos> Hits me at full speed, feel like I can't breathe <eos> And nobody knows this pain inside me <eos> My world is crumbling, I should never have let you go <eos> I think I'm lost without you <eos> I think I'm lost, lost, lost <eos> Ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh-way, ooh, ooh <eos> I think I'm lost without you, you <eos> I just feel crushed without you <eos> And I've been strong for so long <eos> But I never thought how much I love you <eos> Standing on the platform, watching you go <eos> You said, "I wanna see the world" and I said, "Go" <eos>

Paula C <eos> Con el silencio se marchó sin contestar <eos> Y comprendí aquella noche <eos> Que ya nunca jamás olvidaría su querer <eos> Paula C <eos> La madrugada me envolvió en su oscuridad <eos> Y aunque parezca raro, me hizo ver con más claridad <eos> Lo que es amar a una mujer <eos> A tu regreso de nuevo <eos> Aquel beso, me hizo vibrar <eos> Por él volví a soñar <eos> Por él volví a cantar <eos> Y por tu atraso volví a suplicar la felicidad <eos> Sabiendo que eras para mí y nadie más <eos> Paula C <eos> Hoy la distancia nuevamente entre los dos <eos> Es la que anima y me inspira por ti <eos> Esta canción <eos> A la que me entregó su amor <eos> A Paula C <eos> A la que me hizo ser mejor <eos> Aunque se fue <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Madrugada triste llega caramba y mi cama está vacía <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Busco de noche, busco de día <eos> Busco en la tarde y adonde se iría <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Unos dicen que está en Cali <eos> Y otros dicen que en Chitren <eos> Oye que triste quedé (Que triste, que si triste) <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C (Que si triste, triste) <eos> Que si triste es poco <eos> Que si me vuelvo loco, loco <eos> No sé cómo me aclaré <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Pasé por Brasil y no la hallé <eos> Busca que busca y no la encontré <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Paula, ¿dónde te haz ido, caramba? <eos> Será que ahora su casa está en Aralluen <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Por no agradecer tuve que aprender <eos> Solo lo que el golpe enseña <eos> Wichi López <eos> El expreso de Guanabacoa <eos> Te fuiste y quedé perdido <eos> Mi amor herido buscando tu huella <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Mirando, mirando, mirando mis errores de ayer <eos> En el fondo 'e una botella <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Solo queda la memoria <eos> De un amor hoy vuelto leña <eos> Oye que triste quedé <eos> Cuando se fue Paula C <eos> Paulita <eos>

Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> La ventanita del amor se me cerró <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> Las azucenas han perdido su color <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> La ventanita del amor se me cerró <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> No hago mas nada que extrañarte, corazón <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Ya no aguanto esta pena <eos> Tanto tiempo sin verte, es como una condena <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Ya no aguanto esta pena <eos> Tanto tiempo sin verte, es como una condena <eos> Es tan bonito tener tu cariño <eos> Que no soy nada si no estoy contigo <eos> Y tenerte por siempre conmigo <eos> Ser tu abrigo en las noches de frío <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Ya no aguanto esta pena <eos> Tanto tiempo sin verte es como una condena <eos> (música) <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> La ventanita del amor se me cerró <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> Las azucenas han perdido su color <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> La ventanita del amor se me cerró <eos> Desde que me dejaste <eos> No hago mas nada que extrañarte, corazón <eos> Es tan bonito tener tu cariño <eos> Que no soy nada si no estoy contigo <eos> Y tenerte por siempre conmigo <eos> Ser tu abrigo en las noches de frío <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Ya no aguanto esta pena <eos> Tanto tiempo sin verte es como una condena <eos> Musica <eos> Es tan bonito tener tu cariño <eos> Que no soy nada si no estoy contigo <eos> Y tenerte por siempre conmigo <eos> Ya no soy nada si no tengo tu cariño <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> Ya no aguanto esta pena <eos> Tanto tiempo sin verte es como una condena <eos> Música <eos> Pregúntale que si me va dejar morir <eos> Tanto tiempo diciendote que <eos> Tengo el alma en pedazos <eos> 
In my eyes, indisposed <eos> In disguises no one knows <eos> Hides the face, lies the snake <eos> In the sun in my disgrace <eos> Boiling heat, summer stench <eos> 'Neath the black the sky looks dead <eos> Call my name through the cream <eos> And I'll hear you scream again <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? Won't you come? <eos> Stuttering, cold and damp <eos> Steal the warm wind, tired friend <eos> Times are gone for honest men <eos> And sometimes far too long for snakes <eos> In my shoes, a walking sleep <eos> And my youth I pray to keep <eos> Heaven send Hell away <eos> No one sings like you anymore <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Hang my head, drown my fear <eos> 'Til you all just disappear <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun,  won't you come <eos> And wash away the rain? <eos> Black hole sun, won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Black hole sun, black hole sun <eos> Won't you come? <eos> Won't you come? <eos> 
It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Stuck here <eos> Stuck here in these waters <eos> So sick to my stomach <eos> Is anybody there? <eos> Red lights <eos> Red lights in the darkness <eos> Everyone's so heartless <eos> Does anybody care? <eos> It's so hard to explain <eos> With your heart in a cage <eos> Only whisper but you wanna shout <eos> 'Cause the second you wake <eos> Too much pressure to take <eos> Every part of you wants to cry out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> Mirror <eos> Mirror on the wall <eos> I don't see beautiful <eos> Staring back at me <eos> Watching <eos> Watching my heart bleed out <eos> Trying not to freak out <eos> It's hard for girls like us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> 'Cause they don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for all of us <eos> We don't know who we trust <eos> Not even the ones we love <eos> They don't know <eos> Try to numb this pain <eos> 'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again <eos> Left alone out in the rain <eos> They don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> It's hard for us, for girls like us <eos> Girls like us, they don't know <eos> They don't know <eos> 
I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I miss you when I can't sleep <eos> Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat <eos> I miss you in my front seat <eos> Still got sand in my sweaters <eos> From nights we don't remember <eos> Do you miss me like I miss you? <eos> Fucked around and got attached to you <eos> Friends can break your heart, too <eos> And I'm always tired, but never of you <eos> If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that <eos> I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that <eos> I type a text, but thеn I never mind that <eos> I got thesе feelings, but you never mind that <eos> Oh oh, keep it on the low <eos> You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know <eos> If you wanted me, you would just say so <eos> And if I were you, I would never let me go <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm <eos> Wedding bells were just alarms <eos> Caution tape around my heart <eos> You ever wonder what we could have been? <eos> You said you wouldn't and you did <eos> Lie to me, lie with me, get your fix <eos> Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all mixed <eos> Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing <eos> Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance <eos> I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing <eos> But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings <eos> When love and trust are gone <eos> I guess this is moving on <eos> Everyone I do right does me wrong <eos> So every lonely night, I sing this song <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I love you <eos> Don't want to, but I can't put <eos> Nobody else above you <eos> I hate you, I love you <eos> I hate that I want you <eos> You want her, you need her <eos> And I'll never be her <eos> 
The lies, the weight <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> The lies, the weight <eos> It's clear I lost my way <eos> Deceit, decay <eos> Decomposing <eos> I thought I was an architect, but I was just moving dirt <eos> Stacking mud over malice covered-up forming nothing but a pile of hurt <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> Boring the barriers that kept others away <eos> The deeper the walls, the less anyone could hear, hear me fall <eos> So now I know there is no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my lies <eos> Delusional enough to think I'd designed something great <eos> Like a giant headstone inscribed to describe my shameful fate <eos> I hadn't been building <eos> The time was spent digging <eos> An ugly truth from which there was no way to escape <eos> Nowhere left to hide and then finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> Beneath my pride crushing me <eos> Beneath my lies collapsing <eos> But we are still alive <eos> We are still alive <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> My own grave <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> The lies and the weight, I know I lost my way <eos> What I'd become <eos> Buried alive inside of my own grave <eos> And there's no one else to blame <eos> Buried alive, buried alive <eos> Finally forced to face what I'd become <eos> What I'd become in my own grave <eos> Buried in my own grave alive <eos>

This town was built on miles of hope <eos> And I dare you to give me one reason to stay <eos> And maybe I won't go away <eos> So far you've only dared me once <eos> And I think we know that's not even close enough <eos> Not enough for me to stay <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Well I'm getting tired of standing around <eos> Just sitting here and waiting to be found <eos> Same old shit just a different day <eos> Well I'll wait around for one more day <eos> But I know that's what I will always say <eos> Will this ever be O.K.? <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> It costs so much I know <eos> But I guess I need to know <eos> What it would have felt like to be right <eos> But I'm getting tired all over again so hurry up <eos> And get here because I'm still waiting <eos> Just like I've always been <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> Hey now, we'll be around for one more day <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> I will always worry about you <eos> I will always stick up for you <eos> 
"Follow your bliss," it reads on my chest <eos> I know I got it tattooed for a reason, why can't I just hold it true? <eos> Cause I'm still crashing all the funerals <eos> Of these people that I never knew, yeah! <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything <eos> I shut the door and turn all the lights out, and listen to <eos> All the songs that the night shouts, they go something just like this <eos> So, go fill up a glass with tonic rocks and gin <eos> And drink yourself to happiness <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I made up everything <eos> We can all hang ourselves from gold chandeliers <eos> And drink goodbye to all, all the pain and fears <eos> Loose lips have sunk this ship to a shallow grave <eos> Washed up upon the rocks, I won't be saved, I won't be saved! <eos> I'm stuck in a coma, stuck in a never-ending sleep <eos> And someday I will wake up and realize I gave up everything <eos> (I won't be saved) So "follow your bliss," it reads on my chest <eos> (I won't be saved) I know I got it tattooed for a reason <eos> (I won't be saved) I shut the door and turn all the lights out <eos> (I won't be saved) And listen to all the songs that the night shouts... <eos> 
Jesus, don't cry <eos> You can rely on me honey <eos> You can combine anything you want <eos> I'll be around <eos> You were right about the stars <eos> Each one is a setting sun <eos> Tall buildings shake <eos> Voices escape singing sad sad songs <eos> Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks <eos> Bitter melodies turning your orbit around <eos> Don't cry <eos> You can rely on me honey <eos> You can come by any time you want <eos> I'll be around <eos> You were right about the stars <eos> Each one is a setting sun <eos> Tall buildings shake <eos> Voices escape singing sad sad songs <eos> Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks <eos> Bitter melodies turning your orbit around <eos> Voices whine <eos> Skyscrapers are scraping together <eos> Your voice is smoking <eos> Last cigarettes are all you can get <eos> Turning your orbit around <eos> Our love <eos> Our love <eos> Our love is all we have <eos> Our love <eos> Our love is all of God's money <eos> Everyone is a burning sun <eos> Tall buildings shake <eos> Voices escape singing sad sad songs <eos> Tuned to chords strung down your cheeks <eos> Bitter melodies turning your orbit around <eos> Voices whine <eos> Skyscrapers are scraping together <eos> Your voice is smoking <eos> Last cigarettes are all you can get <eos> Turning your orbit around <eos> Last cigarettes are all you can get <eos> Turning your orbit around <eos> Last cigarettes are all you can get <eos> Turning your orbit around <eos> 
Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby left this town <eos> Sunshining all day long <eos> But the rain keep coming down <eos> She's my life I need her so <eos> Why she left I just don't know <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since I set right down and cried <eos> Keep raining all the time <eos> But the river is running dry <eos> Lord help me it just isn't right <eos> I love that girl with all-a my might <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Since my baby broke my heart <eos> Searching for her in a while <eos> Like a blind man in the dark <eos> Love can make a poor man rich <eos> Or break his heart I don't know which <eos> Forty days and forty nights <eos> Like a ship out on the sea <eos> Praying for her each night <eos> That she would come back-a home to me <eos> Life is love and love is right <eos> I hope she come back home tonight <eos> 
There's a man who's been out sailing <eos> In a decade full of dreams <eos> And he takes her to a schooner <eos> And he treats her like a queen <eos> Bearing beads from California <eos> With their amber stones and green <eos> He has called her from the harbor <eos> He has kissed her with his freedom <eos> He has heard her off to starboard <eos> In the breaking and the breathing <eos> Of the water weeds <eos> While she was busy being free <eos> There's a man who's climbed a mountain <eos> And he's calling out her name <eos> And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles <eos> He calls again <eos> He can think her there beside him <eos> He can miss her just the same <eos> He has missed her in the forest <eos> While he showed her all the flowers <eos> And the branches sang the chorus <eos> As he climbed the scaly towers <eos> Of a forest tree <eos> While she was somewhere being free <eos> There's a man who's sent a letter <eos> And he's waiting for reply <eos> He has asked her of her travels <eos> Since the day they said goodbye <eos> He writes "Wish you were beside me <eos> We can make it if we try" <eos> He has seen her at the office <eos> With her name on all his papers <eos> Through the sharing of the profits <eos> He will find it hard to shake her <eos> From his memory <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a lady in the city <eos> And she thinks she loves them all <eos> There's the one who's thinking of her <eos> There's the one who sometimes calls <eos> There's the one who writes her letters <eos> With his facts and figures scrawl <eos> She has brought them to her senses <eos> They have laughed inside her laughter <eos> Now she rallies her defenses <eos> For she fears that one will ask her <eos> For eternity <eos> And she's so busy being free <eos> There's a man who sends her medals <eos> He is bleeding from the war <eos> There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store <eos> There's a drummer and a dreamer <eos> And you know there may be more <eos> She will love them when she sees them <eos> They will lose her if they follow <eos> And she only means to please them <eos> And her heart is full and hollow <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> While she's so busy being free <eos> Like a cactus tree <eos> Being free <eos>

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire <eos> Jack frost nipping at your nose <eos> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir <eos> And folks dressed up like eskimos <eos> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe <eos> Help to make the season bright <eos> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow <eos> Will find it hard to sleep tonight <eos> They know that santa's on his way - <eos> He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh <eos> And ev'rymother's child is gonna spy <eos> To see if reindeer really know how to fly <eos> And so i'm offering this simple phrase <eos> To kids from one to ninety-two <eos> Although its been said many times <eos> Many ways: "merry christmas to you" <eos>

Early in the year feeling, fade away <eos> Something has clearly gone today <eos> Don’t know what I can do <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That it’s the worst way to put you in a song <eos> And I knew it as the words came <eos> All of this was wrong <eos> Early in the year <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That you nearly heal <eos> In the feeling that fades away <eos> There’s something clearly gone today <eos> Don’t know what you wanna heal <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> That it’s the worst way to put you in a song <eos> And I knew that as the words came <eos> All of this was wrong <eos> Early in the year <eos> But I know, I know, I know <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> And don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Baby, don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Baby, don’t I show it <eos> Even when your love comes <eos> Baby, don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love’s gone <eos> Don’t I show it <eos> And even when the light’s on <eos> There’s something wrong and don’t I know it <eos> And you don’t have to tell me nothing <eos> Cause you know that you’ve already shown it <eos> And even when you’re good and strong <eos> The feeling’s gone and don’t I know it <eos> Even when the love is gone <eos> The night turns, she can try to show it <eos> Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I know it? <eos> Oh, why, why, oh, why, why don’t I show it? <eos> Don’t I know it? <eos> Oh, why, why don’t I show it? <eos> Don’t I show it? <eos> 
Take you like a drug <eos> I taste you on my tongue <eos> You ask me what I'm thinking about <eos> I tell you that I'm thinking about <eos> Whatever you're thinking about (ah) <eos> Tell me something that I'll forget <eos> And you might have to tell me again <eos> It's crazy what you'll do for a friend <eos> Go ahead and cry, little girl <eos> Nobody does it like you do <eos> I know how much it matters to you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues <eos> And if you were my little girl <eos> I'd do whatever I could do <eos> I'd run away and hide with you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too <eos> I tried to write your name in the rain <eos> But the rain never came <eos> So I made with the sun <eos> The shade <eos> Always comes at the worst time (ah) <eos> You ask me what I'm thinking about <eos> I tell you that I'm thinking about <eos> Whatever you're thinking about <eos> Tell me something that I'll forget <eos> And you might have to tell me again <eos> It's crazy what you'll do for a friend <eos> Go ahead and cry, little girl <eos> Nobody does it like you do <eos> I know how much it matters to you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues <eos> And if you were my little girl <eos> I'd do whatever I could do <eos> I'd run away and hide with you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues <eos> I keep on trying to let you go <eos> I'm dying to let you know <eos> How I'm getting on <eos> I didn't cry when you left at first <eos> But now that you're dead it hurts <eos> This time I gotta know <eos> Where did my daddy go? <eos> I'm not entirely here <eos> Half of me has disappeared <eos> Go ahead and cry, little boy <eos> You know that your daddy did too <eos> You know what your mama went through <eos> You gotta let it out soon, just let it out <eos> Go ahead and cry, little girl <eos> Nobody does it like you do <eos> I know how much it matters to you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues <eos> And if you were my little girl <eos> I'd do whatever I could do <eos> I'd run away and hide with you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too <eos> If you were my little girl <eos> I'd do whatever I could do <eos> I'd run away and hide with you <eos> I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too <eos> 
Danny was an old-time Bourbon Street barker <eos> Who wanted the same as Charlie Parker <eos> And always cued-up a ball <eos> Thinking he was one rack away <eos> But even when you run the table <eos> The check still seems small <eos> When it's your last payday <eos> The shallow pocket changer <eos> Who always took advantage of strangers <eos> Tried to make a five-grand grab <eos> With a split second getaway <eos> But he forgot that a bag of money <eos> Ain't worth much on a slab <eos> When it's your last payday <eos> That line about luck just can't be bought <eos> You're always lucky 'til you get caught <eos> Trouble will find you, no need to look <eos> And luck won't help when they close the book <eos> I know a lot of young fellas in here <eos> Especially those on the highest tier <eos> Still want to believe <eos> That Santa comes in a sleigh <eos> They're right about the long white beard <eos> But wrong about Christmas Eve <eos> What's Christmas, when it's your last payday <eos>

All the time I’ve had to grow <eos> From the valleys, left alone <eos> Said I had to let you go <eos> To read the writing on the wall <eos> Born and raised in <eos> California <eos> Skies were blue <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> Lost in every place I go <eos> But leaving footprints on the road <eos> Won’t be long before you know <eos> Nothing matters anymore <eos> Born and raisеd in <eos> California <eos> Skies were bluе <eos> I don’t need you <eos> I am free to <eos> Start anew <eos> Remember that <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos> I freed your mind <eos> More than you could ever know <eos> I’m turning tides <eos> Into something beautiful <eos>

I know that people change <eos> But I thought that we would stay the same <eos> In a web of your lies <eos> Didn't give me a good reason why <eos> A stupid fight <eos> Set us alight <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You never learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When we're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> You picked him over me <eos> And you left with no apology <eos> Felt a knife in your back <eos> Yeah, you thought I was the killer <eos> You're lookin' in the mirror <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You nevеr learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When wе're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Toxic games you play <eos> Too high price to pay <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Woah-oh-oh <eos> Nothing's permanent so <eos> Guess I gotta learn to let go <eos> Why can't we talk about it? <eos> You're always walkin' out <eos> You make it worse <eos> You never learn <eos> I don't know how to fake it <eos> When we're disintegrating <eos> No return <eos> We'll crash and burn <eos> 
Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> I'll be the one, if you want me to <eos> Anywhere, I would've followed you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I... am feeling so small <eos> It was over my head <eos> I know nothing at all <eos> And I will stumble and fall <eos> I'm still learning to love <eos> Just starting to crawl <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you <eos> Anywhere, I would've followed you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I will swallow my pride <eos> You're the one that I love <eos> And I'm saying goodbye <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you <eos> And anywhere, I would've followed you, oh-oh <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> Say something, I'm giving up on you <eos> Say something... <eos>

A clown will hide his mask… in the closet till the next trick to come <eos> As a sea of  lust… burning deep inside <eos> Red lights and broken glass <eos> In the corner of a dead end street <eos> The cars, they pass me by <eos> As the people stare in silence on the screen <eos> So hold it, until its light <eos> Too much salt will kill every organ alive <eos> Until nothing lives here, "healthy sadness" as a must <eos> A new wave  of hope, carry me… blind my eyes <eos> Three they were laid upon me, through thеir eyes I see the loss <eos> Onе, lion heart, embraced my weakness with force <eos> The second was too weak to answer, he stared at me and cried <eos> He took my hand behind my back, and waved goodbye <eos> Still hold it… until the light, let the wind blow on my face <eos> Nowhere to hide <eos> Till the light will take me <eos> As years gone by <eos> No daylight in these dead end streets <eos> Those streets of mine <eos> Third, came into my head, whispered my soul those dead lines <eos> "bonded are we" he whispered in my ear, I was too weak even to cry <eos> As "third" marked his name upon me, close to take his stand <eos> "one" took off the fight     illuminate the night <eos> And kicked "Third" off me to death <eos> Why, tell me why, I know the storm is here and the desert will not stay dry <eos> (with tears I) cry, tell me why, I know the storm is here and the desert will not stay dry <eos> Red lights and broken glass <eos> In the corner of a dead end street <eos> The cars, they pass me by <eos> As the people staring silent <eos>

I hear the calling from beyond <eos> I feel the circle closing <eos> I taste the blood of human <eos> I give your life a reason <eos> The snake that coils your soul <eos> Burned we stand, ground covered with ashes <eos> Crematory dust <eos> Clouds fill the sky <eos> No birds sing tonight <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – calls you in <eos> Burned I stand, covered in blood <eos> Clouds darken my soul <eos> Drowning in blood <eos> Deafening howls, the sky is red tonight <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos> I hear the calling from beyond <eos> I feel the circle closing <eos> I taste the blood of human <eos> I give your life a reason <eos> The snake that coils your soul <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – calls you in <eos> Voces ab Alta – voices from the deep <eos> Voces ab Alta – into twilight sleep <eos> They shall bring death <eos> Glory unto them <eos> Feast on ash and blood <eos> Death-pale deep darkness <eos>

夜の帳が下り <eos> その時が来た <eos> 武士は振り返らない <eos> 戦で鍛えし我が身に言おう <eos> 祖国を救うためが（我）ここにあり <eos> 割れし　してやれ <eos> 我らの大地取り戻せ <eos> 蘇りし者よ　蘇りし者 <eos> 己が身はあなたのためにある <eos> 我が身　真実となるは　いつの日ぞ <eos> 我が身　真実となるは　いつの日ぞ <eos> 
Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> I find myself growing in an environment <eos> Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent <eos> In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations <eos> I've seen where some have died in desperation <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto) <eos> Hustling is the only education I know <eos> Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle <eos> A situation like this is getting too hard to handle <eos> To keep <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> With a pregnant woman, yes <eos> And five kids to care for <eos> Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town <eos> As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me <eos> I pray the day will come when I shall be free from <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh, live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury <eos> Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy <eos> Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon <eos> I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be <eos> Battering down sentence <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now <eos> Fighting against conviction <eos> Now a fugitive at large <eos> Could this be my destiny? <eos> With no one to care for the wellfare of my family <eos> In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure <eos> For mind and soul would soon be weary <eos> Just couldn't take no more <eos> Battering down sentence, oh live long day <eos> Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say <eos> Battering down sentence, all day long <eos> Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my song <eos> 
One night to be confused <eos> One night to speed up truth <eos> We had a promise made <eos> Four hands and then away <eos> Both under influence <eos> We had divine sense <eos> To know what to say <eos> Mind is a razor blade <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> One night of magic rush <eos> The start a simple touch <eos> One night to push and scream <eos> And then relief <eos> Ten days of perfect hues <eos> The colors red and blue <eos> We had a promise made <eos> We were in love <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> And you, you knew the hand of the devil <eos> And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth <eos> Sharing different heartbeats <eos> In one night <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> For me, no <eos> To call for hands of above <eos> To lean on <eos> Wouldn't be good enough <eos> 
Hey, I'm feeling tired <eos> My time has gone today <eos> You flirt with suicide <eos> Sometimes that's okay <eos> Do what others say <eos> I'm here standing hollow <eos> Falling away from me <eos> Falling away from me <eos> Day is here fading <eos> That's when I'm insane <eos> I flirt with suicide <eos> Sometimes kill the pain <eos> I can't always say <eos> "It's gonna be better tomorrow" <eos> Falling away from me <eos> Falling away from me <eos> Beating me down! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Screaming some sound! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Falling away from me <eos> It's spinning round and round <eos> Falling away from me <eos> It's lost and can't be found <eos> Falling away from me <eos> It's spinning round and round <eos> Falling away from me <eos> Throw it down <eos> Beating me down! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Screaming some sound! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Twisting me! <eos> They won't go away! <eos> So I pray! <eos> Go away! <eos> Life's falling away from me <eos> It's falling away from me <eos> Life's falling away from me <eos> Fuck! <eos> Beating me down! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Screaming some sound! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Beating me down! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> Screaming some sound! <eos> Beating me, beating me <eos> Down, down <eos> Into the ground! <eos> 
Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo <eos> Caigo de nuevo en tu red <eos> Sé que tarda un tiempo <eos> Curarme de ti de una vez <eos> Tuve tantos momentos felices <eos> Que olvido lo triste que fue <eos> Darte de mi alma <eos> Lo que tú echaste a perder <eos> Yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> Y en la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Tienes, la misma culpa que tengo <eos> Aunque te cueste admitir <eos> Que sientes como siento <eos> La almohada no suele mentir <eos> Y yo no quería amarte <eos> Tú me enseñaste a odiarte <eos> Todos los besos que me imaginé <eos> Vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer <eos> En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos <eos> En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor <eos> En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> Gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz <eos> Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer <eos> Cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor <eos> 
Now and then I think of when we were together <eos> Like when you said you felt so happy you could die <eos> I told myself that you were right for me <eos> But felt so lonely in your company <eos> But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember <eos> You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness <eos> Like resignation to the end, always the end <eos> So when we found that we could not make sense <eos> Well, you said that we would still be friends <eos> But I'll admit that I was glad it was over <eos> But you didn't have to cut me off <eos> Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing <eos> And I don't even need your love <eos> But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough <eos> No, you didn't have to stoop so low <eos> Have your friends collect your records and then change your number <eos> I guess that I don't need that though <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over <eos> But had me believing it was always something that I'd done <eos> But I don't wanna live that way <eos> Reading into every word you say <eos> You said that you could let it go <eos> And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know <eos> But you didn't have to cut me off <eos> Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh) <eos> And I don't even need your love (Oooh) <eos> But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh) <eos> No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh) <eos> Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh) <eos> I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh) <eos> Now you're just somebody that I used to know <eos> Somebody (I used to know) <eos> Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) <eos> Somebody (I used to know) <eos> Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know) <eos> (I used to know) <eos> (That I used to know) <eos> (I used to know) <eos> Somebody <eos> 
Don't act so special <eos> What I do is not for you <eos> Forget about it <eos> You made this mess <eos> I'll knock at your door <eos> Don't you ignore <eos> Or forget about it <eos> (Every night) Got you running in circles, I know <eos> (Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce Cologne <eos> (Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna <eos> (Make me) Walk away and forget about it <eos> Hush <eos> Hush <eos> Don't think you've made it under my skin <eos> Could never get in <eos> Forget about it <eos> Don't talk so much <eos> Your tongue is burning up <eos> I've had enough <eos> Forget about it <eos> (Every night) Got you running in circles, I know <eos> (Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce cologne <eos> (Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna <eos> (Make me) Walk away and forget about it <eos> Falling in my den <eos> Full of lions, full of breath <eos> Take the muzzle from their heads <eos> I'm the sucker for revenge <eos> I see you falling in my den <eos> Full of lions, full of breath <eos> I take the muzzle from theirs heads <eos> I'm a sucker for revenge <eos> Don't act so special <eos> Don't act so good <eos> Forget about it <eos> (Every night) Got you running in circles, I know <eos> (Touchin' me) Get your paws off my Dolce cologne <eos> (Back it up) Off my throne 'cause you know you wanna <eos> (Make me) Walk away and forget about it <eos> Hush <eos> (You gotta keep it hush) <eos> Hush <eos> (You gotta keep it hush) <eos> Hush <eos> 
Me and Magdalena <eos> We're driving south through Monterey <eos> As the sun is slowly sinking <eos> Into a distant ocean wave <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Tell me Magdalena <eos> What do you see in the depths of your night? <eos> Do you see a long lost father? <eos> Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child? <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> Me and Magdalena <eos> Always leaving early and sleeping late <eos> Secluded in the canyon <eos> Lost within a turn of fate <eos> But know everything lost will be recovered <eos> When you drift into the arms of the undiscovered <eos> And I don't know if I've ever loved any other <eos> Half as much as I do in this light she's under <eos> 
As I walk this land of broken dreams <eos> I have visions of many things <eos> But happiness is just an illusion <eos> Filled with sadness and confusion <eos> What becomes of the brokenhearted <eos> Who had love that's now departed? <eos> I know I've got to find <eos> Some kind of peace of mind, maybe <eos> The roots of love grow all around <eos> But for me, they come a-tumbling down <eos> Every day, heartaches grow a little stronger <eos> I can't stand this pain much longer <eos> I walk in shadows, searching for light <eos> Cold and alone, no comfort in sight <eos> Hoping and praying for someone who'll care <eos> Always moving and going nowhere <eos> What becomes of the brokenhearted <eos> Who had love that's now departed? <eos> I know I've got to find <eos> Some kind of peace of mind, help me, please <eos> I'm searching, though I don't succeed <eos> For someone's love, there's a growing need <eos> All is lost, there's no place for beginning <eos> All that's left is an unhappy ending <eos> Now what becomes of the brokenhearted <eos> Who had love that's now departed? <eos> I know I've got to find <eos> Some kind of peace of mind <eos> I'll be searching everywhere <eos> Just to find someone to care <eos> I'll be lookin' every day <eos> I know I'm gonna find a way <eos> Nothing's gonna stop me now <eos> I'll find a way somehow <eos> And I'll be searching everywhere <eos> I know I'm gonna find it there <eos> 
What would you say if you could say <eos> Everything you needed to <eos> To the one, you needed to? <eos> You flash like a setting sun <eos> You come around, I come undone <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> Just yesterday north of LA <eos> I couldn't help but think of you <eos> Every time I think of you <eos> You crash like a rolling wave <eos> You come around I lose my brain <eos> Can't find the sound under my tongue <eos> When I look at you <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> (And you, and you, and you) <eos> I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go <eos> There are only twenty <eos> Six letters I can use <eos> Just to tell you I won't let go <eos> Don't you let go <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> I lose my voice when I look at you <eos> Can't make a noise though I'm trying to <eos> Tell you all the right words <eos> Waiting on the right words <eos> (I've been searching for the right words <eos> Right words, but I <eos> I can't even find an echo <eos> Don't you let go) <eos> Just another lovesick afternoon <eos> Black butterflies and déjà vu <eos> Hoping for the right words <eos> Waiting for the right words <eos> 
Yeah <eos> Pack your bags 'cause we got no reason to lay low <eos> What was my line? <eos> Fuck it <eos> Two, three, go <eos> Sing <eos> La-la-la <eos> You always said I'd be a disappointment <eos> That I'd be nothing and I'd probably lose it all <eos> You thought that I would trip and fall <eos> But you'll never see me beg or crawl <eos> Can't take it, won't fake it, punch a hole through the wall, try to break it <eos> Can't change it, rearrange it, so I guess that I'll just have to face it <eos> This is bloody knuckles and I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain, yeah <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> Another day, another disappointment <eos> My head is tripping, might as well just slip away <eos> You all think I'm crazy anyway <eos> You all think I'm crazy <eos> Won't give in, never fit in, it's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> You dig in, don't pretend, I'm already down, but you keep on pushing <eos> Life is a fight, but you don't ever fight fair <eos> Beat us to the ground, but we will never stay there <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> I won't give in, never fit in <eos> It's a knife in the back that you twist in <eos> This is bloody knuckles, I'll show you how to play <eos> It's the only way to escape from all the pain <eos> Away from all this pain <eos> We bought a one-way ticket 'cause we're sick of it all <eos> Pack your bags we're going <eos> At the bottom, but we got no reason to lay low <eos> Like you care anyway, no <eos> Here, take one last breath <eos> Take all you can till there's nothing left <eos> We'll never do what you say, no <eos> Until we drop dead, never let go <eos> 
She says she's no good <eos> With words, but I'm worse <eos> Barely stuttered out <eos> A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue <eos> Weighed down with words too <eos> Overdramatic <eos> Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse" <eos> Versus "No one should ever feel like..." <eos> I'm two quarters and a heart down <eos> And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds <eos> These words are all I have so I write them <eos> So you need them just to get by (...emal si namhorT eoJ) <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me <eos> You always fold just <eos> Before you're found out <eos> Drink up, it's last call, last resort <eos> But only the first mistake, and I <eos> I'm two quarters and a heart down <eos> And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds <eos> These words are all I have so I write them <eos> So you need them just to get by <eos> Why don't you show me the little bit of spine <eos> You've been saving for his mattress, love <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me <eos> Why don't you show me the little bit of spine <eos> You've been saving for his mattress (Mattress, mattress) <eos> I only want sympathy in the form of you <eos> Crawling into bed with me <eos> Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time <eos> Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love (Way they'd love) <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love me (Way they'd love) <eos> Dance, this is the way they'd love <eos> If they knew how misery loved me... <eos> Dance, dance, dance, dance <eos> Dance, dance, dance, dance <eos> 
You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> 'Cause it wasn't yours <eos> I saw the signs and I ignored it <eos> Rose-colored glasses all distorted <eos> Set fire to my purpose <eos> And I let it burn <eos> You got off on the hurtin' <eos> When it wasn't yours, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> I gave my all and they all know it <eos> Then you tore me down and now it's showing <eos> In two months, you replaced us <eos> Like it was easy <eos> Made me think I deserved it <eos> In the thick of healing, yeah <eos> We'd always go into it blindly <eos> I needed to lose you to find me <eos> This dancing was killing me softly <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> You promised the world and I fell for it <eos> I put you first and you adored it <eos> Set fires to my forest <eos> And you let it burn <eos> Sang off-key in my chorus <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to hate you to love me, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> I needed to lose you to love me <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now the chapter is closed and done <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, love, yeah <eos> To love, yeah <eos> And now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us <eos>

The very thought of you makes my heart sing <eos> Like an April breeze on the wings of spring <eos> And you appear in all your splendor <eos> My one and only love <eos> The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms <eos> In the hush of night while you're in my arms <eos> I feel your lips so warm and tender <eos> My one and only love <eos> The touch of your hand is like heaven <eos> A heaven that I've never known <eos> The blush on your cheek whenever I speak <eos> Tells me that you are my own <eos> You fill my eager heart with such desire <eos> Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire <eos> I give myself in sweet surrender <eos> My one and only love <eos> My one and only love <eos>

Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep <eos> And showed me how this town can shatter dreams <eos> Another lesson 'bout a naive fool who came to Babylon <eos> And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet <eos> Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> Ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives <eos> Painful scars are all that's left of me <eos> Oh, but thank you girl for teachin' me brand new ways to be cruel <eos> If I can find my mind now I guess I'll just leave <eos> And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> Lonely, lonely streets that I call home <eos> Yeah, my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> It's the only thing that keeps me hangin' on <eos> 
Standing tall feeling small horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb the mountain to breathe it <eos> You've spoken yet words fail us again <eos> Love language, language limits <eos> Sparkling twilight heart exploding horizons <eos> Flowering dreamscape slow descending I breathe in <eos> You give, you give yet words fail us again <eos> Love language lost in modern lives <eos> Mountains whisper, whisper, whisper <eos> Mountains whisper, mountains whisper <eos> Every word in all of history a million years of toil and folly <eos> None move more than mountains whispers you breathe in me <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> When the storm comes climb mountain to breathe in <eos> Though we dance we'll separate like oil and water <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos> In the morning, in the evening horizons <eos>

Standing on the edge of the Palisades' Cliffs <eos> In the shadow of the skyline very far away <eos> Like a lightning rod that couldn’t pull the storm from me <eos> I was 5 years old, my best friend's older brother died <eos> He fell from these cliffs <eos> The river washed him away, the current pulled him downstream <eos> And our lives float in the headlines, so we park these cars <eos> Parent’s garage <eos> Listen to the lullaby <eos> Of carbon monoxide <eos> War all of the time <eos> In the shadow of the New York skyline <eos> We grew up too fast, falling apart <eos> Like the ashes of American flags <eos> If the sun doesn't rise <eos> We'll replace it with an H-bomb explosion <eos> A painted jail cell of light in the sky <eos> Like three-mile-island nightmares on TVs that sing us to sleep <eos> They burn on and on like an oil field <eos> Or a memory of what it felt like <eos> To burn on and on and not just fade away <eos> All those nights in the basement, the kids are still screaming <eos> On and on and on and on <eos> War all of the time <eos> In the shadow of the New York skyline <eos> We grew up too fast, falling apart <eos> Like the ashes of American flags <eos> And we’re blowing in the wind <eos> We don’t know where to land <eos> So we kiss like little kids <eos> We used to be very tall buildings <eos> We’ve been falling for so long <eos> Now your eyes are a sign on the edge of town <eos> They offer a welcome when you are leaving <eos> War all of the time <eos> In the shadow of the New York skyline <eos> We grew up too fast, falling apart <eos> Like the ashes of American flags <eos> The pieces fall it’s like a last day parade <eos> And the fires in our streets start to rage <eos> So wave to those people who long to wave back <eos> From the fabric of a flag that sang "love all of the time" <eos> War all the time, war all the time <eos> All of the time <eos> War all the time, war all the time <eos> All of the time <eos> All of the time <eos> War all of the time <eos> War all of the time <eos> War all of the time <eos> War all of the time <eos> 
Go! <eos> So one, two, three <eos> Take my hand and come with me <eos> Because you look so fine <eos> That I really wanna make you mine <eos> I said, you look so fine <eos> That I really wanna make you mine <eos> Oh, four, five, six <eos> Come on and get your kicks <eos> Now you don't need that money <eos> When you look like that, do ya, honey? <eos> Big black boots, long brown hair <eos> She's so sweet with her get-back stare <eos> Well, I could see you home with me <eos> But you were with another man, yeah <eos> I know we ain't got much to say <eos> Before I let you get away, yeah <eos> I said, are you gonna be my girl? <eos> So one, two, three <eos> Take my hand and come with me <eos> Because you look so fine <eos> That I really wanna make you mine <eos> I said, you look so fine <eos> That I really wanna make you mine <eos> Oh, four, five, six <eos> Come on and get your kicks <eos> Now you don't need that money <eos> With a face like that, do ya? <eos> Big black boots, long brown hair <eos> She's so sweet with her get-back stare <eos> Well, I could see you home with me <eos> But you were with another man, yeah <eos> I know we ain't got much to say <eos> Before I let you get away, yeah <eos> I said, are you gonna be my girl? <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Come on <eos> I could see you home with me <eos> But you were with another man, yeah <eos> I know we ain't got much to say <eos> Before I let you get away, yeah <eos> Uh, be my girl <eos> Be my girl <eos> Are you gonna be my girl? <eos> Yeah! <eos> 
Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A s'offrir en partage <eos> Au jour du grand voyage <eos> Qu'est notre grand amour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Mon amour toi et moi <eos> Pour qu'éclatent de joie <eos> Chaque heure et chaque jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour vivre nos promesses <eos> Sans nulle autre richesse <eos> Que d'y croire toujours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour meubler de merveilles <eos> Et couvrir de soleil <eos> La laideur des faubourgs <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour unique raison <eos> Pour unique chanson <eos> Et unique secours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour habiller matin <eos> Pauvres et malandrins <eos> De manteaux de velours <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir en prière <eos> Pour les maux de la terre <eos> En simple troubadour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> A offrir à ceux-là <eos> Dont l'unique combat <eos> Est de chercher le jour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour tracer un chemin <eos> Et forcer le destin <eos> A chaque carrefour <eos> Quand on n'a que l'amour <eos> Pour parler aux canons <eos> Et rien qu'une chanson <eos> Pour convaincre un tambour <eos> Alors sans avoir rien <eos> Que la force d'aimer <eos> Nous aurons dans nos mains <eos> Amis le monde entier <eos>

I don't wanna seem the way I do <eos> But I'm confident when I'm with you <eos> Lately, all I feel is bad and bruised <eos> Tired of tripping on my shoes <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like I'm floating when he calls me pretty <eos> I feel like somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> When I start to tumble from the sky <eos> You remind me how to fly <eos> Lately I've been feeling not alive <eos> But you bring me back to life <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like somebody whеn he calls me pretty <eos> I feel lifе somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> But when he loves me <eos> I feel like somebody when he calls me pretty <eos> I feel like somebody <eos> Even when we eventually fade to nothing <eos> You'll always be my favorite form of loving <eos> 
No hace falta que me quites la mirada <eos> Para que entienda que ya no queda nada <eos> Aquella luna que antes nos bailaba <eos> Se ha cansado y ahora nos da la espalda <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> Tengo contados todos los besos que nos damos <eos> Y tú fugitiva, andas perdida en otro lado <eos> Yo no quiero caricias de otros labios <eos> No quiero tus manos en otras manos <eos> Porque yo quiero que volvamos a intentarlo <eos> ¿Dónde está el amor del que tanto hablan? <eos> ¿Por qué no nos sorprende y rompe nuestra calma? <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> (Donde esta el amor) <eos> Déjame que vuelva a acariciar tu pelo <eos> Déjame que funda tu pecho en mi pecho <eos> Volveré a pintar de colores el cielo <eos> Haré que olvides de una vez el mundo entero <eos> Déjame tan solo que hoy roce tu boca <eos> Déjame que voy a detener las horas <eos> Volveré a pintar de azul el universo <eos> Haré que todo esto sólo sea un sueño <eos> 
I backed my car into a cop car the other day <eos> Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay <eos> I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say? <eos> Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on anyway, well <eos> A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam <eos> It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand <eos> Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands <eos> Good news will work its way to all them plans <eos> We both got fired on exactly the same day <eos> Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way <eos> Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose <eos> Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose <eos> Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on, okay <eos> And we'll all float on, alright <eos> Already, we'll all float on <eos> No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright <eos> Already, we'll all float on, alright <eos> Don't worry, we'll all float on <eos> (Alright, already) And we'll all float on <eos> Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright <eos> Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy <eos> We'll all float on <eos> Alright, already, we'll all float on  <eos> Alright, already, we'll all float on  <eos> Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on  <eos> Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on  <eos> Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!)  <eos> Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!) <eos> We'll all float on <eos> 
Hallé una flor un día en el camino <eos> Que apareció marchita y deshojada <eos> Ya casi pálida, ahogada en un suspiro <eos> Me la llevé a mi jardín para cuidarla <eos> Aquella flor de pétalos dormidos <eos> A la que cuido hoy con todo el alma <eos> Recuperó el color que había perdido <eos> Porque encontró un cuidador que la regara <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que nadie le robe el color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> De aquella flor surgieron tantas cosas <eos> Nació el amor que un día se había perdido <eos> Y con la luz del sol se fue la sombra <eos> Y con la sombra la distancia y el olvido <eos> Le fui poniendo un poquito de amor <eos> La fui abrigando en mi alma <eos> Y en el invierno le daba calor <eos> Para que no se dañara <eos> De aquella flor hoy el dueño soy yo <eos> Y he prometido cuidarla <eos> Para que siempre este cerca de mí <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Le fui brindando cariño, un poquito de amor <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Y en el invierno llenó mi jardín de color <eos> Para que nunca se vaya <eos> Ay, cuando la vi, me enamoré y me la llevé, me la llevé <eos> ¡Avemaría! <eos> ¡Puerto Rico! <eos> Jajaja <eos> ¡Ataca, Sergio <eos> ¡Uy! <eos> ¡Esto sigue! <eos> 
Me muero por robarte un beso <eos> Y porque pierda la razón <eos> Tal vez asi me atrevería <eos> Y pierda miedo el corazón <eos> Me muero por amar despacio <eos> La prisa no nos debe apurar <eos> Ya sabes que la vida es un viaje <eos> Y yo lo quiero disfrutar <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Me muero por cruzar el tiempo <eos> Si el alma no se puede ver <eos> Qué pasa si se va la vida <eos> O tal vez solo un recuerdo es <eos> Por eso si el recuerdo queda <eos> Que quede la memoria llena <eos> La quiero saturar por contemplar <eos> Tus ojos y una luna llena <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti, por ti <eos> Me muero por vivir contigo <eos> Lo que me queda por andar <eos> Pedirle a dios que cambie el tiempo <eos> Y que lo vuelta eternidad <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si me muero, si yo me muero <eos> De amor que muera <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Y que cuando muera <eos> Que sea de amor por ti <eos> Si yo me muero <eos> Muero de amor, por ti <eos> 
Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye <eos> You wanna go, then baby, just leave <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> You said my life was too fucked up to be with you <eos> But here you go to the bar 'til 2 <eos> I wanna know what he has that I don't <eos> Well, I was ready for the real thing <eos> No more shame in this life I live 'cause I would change for you <eos> Don't know the hope you gave to me <eos> But I guess that I'm okay, just need some cocaine <eos> And a bottle that'll float my mind <eos> And take a trip to another world where you would be mine <eos> Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye <eos> You wanna go, then baby, just leave <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> I found a couple of your long hairs in the passenger seat <eos> Where you looked over, smiled at me <eos> Guess a picture ain't worth as many words as they say <eos> And don't tell me that it's okay, I'll find my own way <eos> Don't need your excuse to ease my pain <eos> Guess it's just time for me to work on me <eos> Well, I don't wanna hear the good side, there ain't no good side <eos> You ain't never gonna see what I see <eos> Don't tell me that you still care, that I'll always be special <eos> 'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing <eos> I hate that I'm still up, I'm drunk as fuck <eos> 4 AM, writin' this damn song <eos> I hate that I'm okay at bein' okay <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> Give it time and I'll soon move on <eos> 
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner <eos> Sometimes I feel like my only friend <eos> Is the city I live in, The City of Angels <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion <eos> I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am <eos> She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy <eos> Well, I never worry, now that is a lie <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love, take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there <eos> It's hard to believe that I'm all alone <eos> At least I have her love <eos> The city, she loves me <eos> Lonely as I am together we cry <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day <eos> But take me to the place I love take me all the way <eos> Yeah, yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah <eos> Love me, I say, yeah yeah <eos> One time <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Is where I drew some blood <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I could not get enough <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> Forgot about my love <eos> (Under the bridge downtown) <eos> I gave my life away, yeah <eos> Yeah yeah <eos> Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah <eos> Oh no, I said oh, yeah yeah <eos> Here I stay <eos> 
There's a tear in the mud on the banks of the river <eos> And the sound of a lover's goodbye <eos> And a pain in my heart 'cause I could not forgive her <eos> That's as deep as the river is wide <eos> I'm lost and I'm lonesome when I look in the mirror <eos> I don't like the man that I see <eos> And the more that I look, the more it gets clearer <eos> Pride made a fool out of me <eos> So I drink all night <eos> But the hurtin' won't stop <eos> And every shot I take just turns into teardrops <eos> When I lay down to sleep <eos> And I pray I don't open my eyes <eos> To a whiskey sunrise <eos> The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter <eos> And the rain will be comin' on soon <eos> And everything's wrong and nothin' don't matter <eos> And a black cloud is crossin' the moon <eos> So I drink all night <eos> But the hurtin' won't stop <eos> And every shot I take just turns into teardrops <eos> And I lay down to sleep <eos> And I pray I don't open my eyes <eos> To a whiskey sunrise <eos> 
Yeah, I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Pulling away from all my sins <eos> Tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> I don't wanna leave you lonely but I've got to <eos> 'Cause it's only the things I need to prove <eos> To you and everybody else <eos> That scares me so damn much <eos> I can't take it I'm not strong <eos> It's probably best that I move on <eos> Get outta here, fade away <eos> That's why I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> And tell my momma I love her and take care of my friends <eos> When I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Everybody's gotta die somehow <eos> Why not for me right now, right now <eos> Well, I'm out drunk driving again <eos> Drunk driving again <eos> I'm drunk driving again <eos> Running away from all of my sins <eos> Tell my mother I lovе her and take care of my friеnds <eos> 'Cause I'm just drunk driving again <eos> Yeah, I'm drunk driving again <eos> 
Whoo um, yeah <eos> Life is like a road that you travel on <eos> When there is one day here and the next day gone <eos> Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand <eos> Sometimes you turn your back to the wind <eos> There is a world outside every darkened door <eos> Where blues will not haunt you anymore <eos> Where brave are free and lovers soar <eos> Come ride with me to the distant shore <eos> We won't hesitate <eos> To break down the garden gate <eos> There's not much time left today, yeah <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long <eos> If you are going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos> Through all these cities and all these towns <eos> It's in my blood and it is all around <eos> I love you now like I loved you then <eos> This is the road and these are the hands <eos> From Mozambique to those Memphis nights <eos> The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights <eos> Knock me down get back up again <eos> You are in my blood <eos> I am not a lonely man <eos> There is no load I cannot hold <eos> Road so rough this I know <eos> I will be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell them we are survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long, ooh! <eos> If you are going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (All night long) <eos> A gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long, mmm yeah <eos> If you are going my way (You are going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long (All night long) <eos> There was a distance between you and I (Between you and I) <eos> A misunderstanding once <eos> But now we look it in the eyes <eos> Ooh, yeah <eos> There ain't no load that I can't hold <eos> The roads are rough, this I know <eos> I'll be there when the light comes in <eos> Just tell them we're survivors <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (All night long, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way <eos> I want to drive it all night long (A gimme, gimme, gimme, a gimme, gimme, yeah) <eos> Life is a highway (Life is a highway) <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Wooh, yeah) <eos> If you're going my way (Going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long (Ooh, yeah, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, yeah) <eos> Life is a highway <eos> I want to ride it all night long (Yeah, I want to ride it all night long, babe) <eos> If you're going my way (You going my way) <eos> I want to drive it all night long <eos>

Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And the cares that hung around me through the week <eos> Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak <eos> When we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to climb a mountain <eos> And reach the highest peak <eos> But it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Oh I love to go out fishing <eos> In a river or a creek <eos> But I don't enjoy it half as much <eos> As dancing cheek to cheek <eos> Now Mamma Dance with me <eos> I want my arm(s) about you <eos> That (Those) charm(s) about you <eos> Will carry me through... <eos> (Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven <eos> And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak <eos> And I seem to find the happiness I seek <eos> When we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging) <eos> Out together dancing cheek to cheek <eos>

I could have been easier on you <eos> I could have been all you held onto <eos> I know I wasn't fair, I tried my best to care about you <eos> I know I could have been a better man <eos> But I always had to have the upper hand <eos> I'm struggling to see the better side of me <eos> But I can't take all your jabs and taunts <eos> You're pointing out my every fault <eos> And you wonder why I walked away <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> Remember on my 21st birthday <eos> You took me where we went on our first date <eos> We stayed till closing time, after 4 glasses of wine <eos> You started with a pointless argument <eos> You said that I forgot to compliment <eos> The dress you wore that night <eos> That I've seen a thousand times <eos> But I think we just want different things <eos> I want space, you want a diamond ring <eos> Whatever made you think we were meant to be? <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos> You tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less <eos> When you tell me I'm a wreck <eos> You say that I'm a mess <eos> How could you expect anything less? <eos> You latched onto me then cried that I strung you along <eos> I told you when you asked <eos> I knew this wouldn't last <eos> At least I could be honest about that <eos> And now you're telling everyone <eos> How I only did you wrong <eos> Still I see you standing there <eos> Waiting 'round for me to fall <eos> Girl you must be crazy <eos> Still believing you and me belong <eos> I guess you never knew me at all <eos>

Wise men say only fools rush in <eos> But I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Shall I stay? Would it be a sin <eos> If I can't help falling in love with you? <eos> Like a river flows <eos> Surely to the sea <eos> Darling, so it goes <eos> Some things are meant to be <eos> Take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> Like a river flows <eos> Surely to the sea <eos> Darling, so it goes <eos> Some things are meant to be <eos> Take my hand, take my whole life, too <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos> For I can't help falling in love with you <eos>

Quand'è che spento il cuore? <eos> Che ho smesso di sognare <eos> Un nuovo amore? <eos> Il dubbio dentro me <eos> E ho smesso di sperare <eos> Ma a un tratto, tu <eos> Risvegli nel profondo <eos> Un fuoco che mi accende <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and resterò <eos> Per costruire un sogno <eos> One more time <eos> Who cares about the past? <eos> Who knows about tomorrow? <eos> L'amore è adesso <eos> And maybe this won't last <eos> Maybe this moment's all we have <eos> Let's find out <eos> And though I'm still afraid <eos> You're worth a leap of faith <eos> I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> To see the world that we make <eos> I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> As if my heart cannot break <eos> One more time <eos> Here and now, up against the edge <eos> Promise me you won't look down <eos> Won't fall off the ledge <eos> Take my hand and show me how to love again <eos> And I'll return to love and risk it all <eos> Per regalarti un mondo <eos> And I'll return to love and take the fall <eos> Per costruire ancora <eos> One more time <eos> 
Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool <eos> That's what I'm a-doin' today <eos> Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin' <eos> I'm a boozin' my troubles away <eos> Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway <eos> She can't say that I didn't try <eos> Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one <eos> I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye <eos> Everytime we disagreed <eos> She was always askin' me <eos> Are you a man or a mouse? <eos> Now that she's gone <eos> She probably thinks I'm home <eos> Just a mopin' around the house <eos> She probably thinks that she's the one thing <eos> I just couldn't get along without <eos> Well wouldn't it surprise her I got a sympathizer <eos> As long as these bottles hold out <eos> Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool <eos> That's what I'm a-doin' today <eos> Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin' <eos> I'm a boozin' my troubles away <eos> Well now I couldn't make her stay, well doggone her anyway <eos> She can't say that I didn't try <eos> Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one <eos> I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye <eos> Every time I try to sit down and talk to her <eos> It always ends up in a fuss <eos> I tried to reason with her right up to the time <eos> She got on that Greyhound bus <eos> It would be better if I could forget her <eos> 'Cause she sure forgot about me <eos> And if takes all night I'm gonna' do it right <eos> I'm gonna' sit here till I can't see <eos> Sittin' on a bar stool actin' like a durn fool <eos> That's what I'm a-doin' today <eos> Sitting' her drinkin' tryin' to keep from thinkin' <eos> I'm a boozin' my troubles away <eos> Well now I couldn't make her stay well doggone her anyway <eos> She can't say that I didn't try <eos> Pour me another one, I'm finished with the other one <eos> I'm drinkin' my baby goodbye <eos> 
The cattle are prowlin' <eos> The coyotes are howlin' <eos> Way out where the doggies roam <eos> Where spurs are a jinglin' <eos> And the cowboy is singing <eos> His lonesome cattle call <eos> He rides in the sun <eos> 'Til his days work is done <eos> And he rounds up the cattle each fall <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> For hours he would ride <eos> On the range far and wide <eos> When the night wind blows up and slow <eos> His heart is a feather <eos> In all kinds of weather <eos> He sings his cattle call <eos> He's browned as a fairy <eos> From ridin' the prairie <eos> And he sings with an western drawl <eos> Singing his cattle call <eos> 
Do you remember happy together? <eos> I do, don't you? <eos> Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach <eos> Is that still true? <eos> You said, "forever," in the end I fought it <eos> Please be honest, are we better for it? <eos> Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called <eos> And said, "I miss you" <eos> I caught it <eos> Good to each other, give it the summer <eos> I knew, you too <eos> But I only saw you once in December <eos> I'm still confused <eos> You said, "forever," and I almost bought it <eos> I miss fighting in your old apartment <eos> Breaking dishes when you're disappointed <eos> I still love you, I promise <eos> Nothing happened in the way I wanted <eos> Every corner of this house is haunted <eos> And I know you said that we're not talking <eos> But I miss you, I'm sorry <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (You said, "forever," and I almost bought it) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (I miss fighting in your old apartment) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (Breaking dishes when you're disappointed) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (I still love you, I promise) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you (Nothing happened in the way I wanted) <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse (Every corner of this house is haunted) <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us (And I know you said that we're not talking) <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before (But I miss you) <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos> I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse <eos> Everything I know brings me back to us <eos> I don't wanna go, we've been here before <eos> Everywhere I go leads me back to you <eos>

She got sour, mad and pack all her stuff when it doesn't work <eos> Put a knife in my back and I still would be next to her <eos> I've been fucked up <eos> Broken, still not over <eos> Put a gun to my heart and I still would have pulled it first <eos> I fell in love with the freckles and the flaws <eos> The way she move her hands <eos> Bet you'll be the death of me, oh I know <eos> I'm addicted to her sadness <eos> Though I handle all the madness <eos> She makes everything dramatic <eos> But I love her likе a maniac <eos> My friends say she's not good for me <eos> But I don't bеlieve them <eos> If they don't see that blue from  <eos> Then I don't really need them anymore <eos> Always carried the back that she got from the family, mm <eos> Everyone that she  turned her life into agony <eos> She's been fucked up <eos> Broken, still not sober <eos> She got off all the strings with her friends, but she still got me <eos> I fell in love with the freckles and the flaws <eos> The way she move her hands <eos> Bet you'll be the death of me, oh I know <eos> I'm addicted to her sadness <eos> Though I handle all the madness <eos> She makes everything dramatic <eos> But I love her like a maniac <eos> My friends say she's not good for me <eos> But I don't believe them <eos> If they don't see that blue from  <eos> Then I don't really need them anymore <eos> I don't think she understands <eos> What she's doing with my head <eos>  sweater in my bed <eos> 'Til I met her <eos> I will probably be dead <eos> And do anything she says <eos> Take me with her to the edge <eos> And I'll let her <eos> I'm addicted to her sadness <eos> Though I handle all the madness <eos> She makes everything dramatic <eos> But I love her like a maniac <eos> My friends say she's not good for me <eos> But I don't believe them <eos> If they don't see that blue from  <eos> Then I don't really need them anymore <eos> Don't really need them anymore <eos> Don't really need them <eos>

There is hope for us <eos> There is distance between you and I <eos> We have just enough <eos> And it comes as no surprise <eos> I was in between <eos> You were matches and kerosene <eos> Is your conscience clear? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Can you get it clean? <eos> Did you celebrate without me? <eos> Did you tell them all about me? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Does it get you off <eos> To get it off your chest? <eos> Such an awful year <eos> Such an awful mess <eos> You can't write <eos> You can't sing <eos> You can't do anything at all <eos> Is there someone here? <eos> Can you make the call? <eos> Please, make the call <eos> And the ambulance is here <eos> And if I haven't made it clear... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> If you ever had a doubt <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> Is there hope for us? <eos> There are constants that we can't define <eos> Is it all used up? <eos> Are we out of time? <eos> Did you sell me out? <eos> Well, if you ever had a doubt... <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Now, the ambulance is here <eos> And if I still haven't made it clear <eos> Kiss me on the mouth <eos> Can you sing for me? <eos> Can you sing it out? <eos> 
Recuerdo que al llegar ni me miraste <eos> Fui solo una más de cientos <eos> Y, sin embargo, fueron tuyos <eos> Los primeros voleteos <eos> Cómo no pude darme cuenta <eos> Que hay ascensores prohibidos <eos> Que hay pecados compartidos <eos> Y que tú estabas tan cerca <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Mis anclajes no pararon tus instintos <eos> Ni los tuyos, mis quejidos <eos> Y dejo correr mis tuercas <eos> Y que hormigas me retuerzan <eos> Quiero que no dejes de estrujarme <eos> Sin que yo te diga nada <eos> Que tus yemas sean lagañas <eos> Enganchadas a mis vértices <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> No sé que acabó sucediendo <eos> Sólo sentí dentro dardos <eos> Nuestra incómoda postura <eos> Se dilató en el espacio <eos> Se me hunde el dolor en el costado <eos> Se me nublan los recodos <eos> Tengo sed y estoy tragando <eos> No quiero no estar a tu lado <eos> Me disfrazo de ti <eos> Te disfrazas de mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser humanos <eos> En esta habitación gris <eos> Muerdo el agua por ti <eos> Te deslizas por mí <eos> Y jugamos a ser dos gatos <eos> Que no se quieren dormir <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> Y las palabras se me apartan <eos> Me vacían las entrañas <eos> Finjo que no sé, y que no has sabido <eos> Finjo que no me gusta estar contigo <eos> Y al perderme entre mis dedos <eos> Te recuerdo sin esfuerzo <eos> Me moriré de ganas de decirte <eos> Que te voy a echar de menos <eos> 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must have been something you said <eos> I just died in your arms tonight <eos> I keep looking for something I can't get <eos> Broken hearts lie all around me <eos> And I don't see an easy way to get out of this <eos> Her diary, it sits by the bedside table <eos> The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle <eos> Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been something you said <eos> I just died in your arms tonight <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been some kind of kiss <eos> I should've walked away, I should've walked away <eos> Is there any just cause for feeling like this? <eos> On the surface, I'm a name on a list <eos> I try to be discreet, but then blow it again <eos> I've lost and found, it's my final mistake <eos> She's loving by proxy, no give and all take <eos> Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been something you said <eos> I just died in your arms tonight <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been some kind of kiss <eos> I should've walked away, I should've walked away <eos> It was a long hot night <eos> She made it easy, she made it feel right <eos> But now it's over the moment has gone <eos> I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been something you said <eos> I just died in your arms tonight <eos> Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight <eos> It must've been some kind of kiss <eos> I should've walked away, I should've walked away <eos> 
We're waiting for collapse <eos> In the cold and lonely mirror <eos> Reflections all you see <eos> Of the world you made on your own with no mercy <eos> And they call you a liar <eos> But you won't surrender <eos> And they can choose to run <eos> With hypocrisy <eos> It happens every day <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> The revolution lives <eos> In the beat of our hearts and the burning sound of the flames we started in <eos> Can you hear it now? Can you feel the hurt? <eos> This silent hate <eos> And they worship a liar <eos> But we won't surrender <eos> And we won't ever run <eos> From the pain you see <eos> Because now we're free <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> We were born to fight for this when all they ever do is pray <eos> Never see the truth we miss when fear consumes the rage <eos> We take control, don't give up, when all they know is corrupt <eos> We were born to fight for this and lead us through crimson skies <eos> 
All you wanna do is cocaine <eos> Play guitar, think that you're Cobain <eos> Paint your nails, and you pop your pills <eos> And you tell your friends how you copped a feel <eos> Why you gotta roll your own smokes? <eos> You're the only one laughing at your own jokes <eos> You can bleach you're hair 'til your someone else <eos> But I'll  always have you figured out <eos> (Oh) You're so full of it <eos> (Oh) Smells like counterfeit <eos> (Oh) Just a narcissist, faking it <eos> Oh, you're such a wannabe (Oh) <eos> But you can't pull that shit with me (Oh) <eos> Nothing but a wannabe (Oh) <eos> Boy, that shit is basic, such an imitation <eos> Such a wannabe <eos> Babe, you're a walking cliche <eos> Drop me off if you wanna draw names <eos> Play pretend with your famous friends <eos> But I wonder why they never call on weekdays <eos> (Oh) You'll do anything <eos> (Oh) To be relеvant <eos> (Oh) I'm just telling it how it is <eos> Oh, you're such a wannabe (Oh) <eos> But you can't pull that shit with mе (Oh) <eos> Nothing but a wannabe (Oh) <eos> Boy, that shit is basic, such an imitation <eos> Such a wannabe <eos> You just want attention <eos> Followers and mentions <eos> Wonder what it feels like running away from real life <eos> Oh, you're such a wannabe (Such a wannabe) (Oh) <eos> But you can't pull that shit with me (That shit with me) (Oh) <eos> Nothing but a wannabe (Nothing but a wannabe) (Oh) <eos> Boy, that shit is basic, such an imitation <eos> Such a wannabe <eos> 
(One, two) <eos> Stop the clocks, it's amazing <eos> You should see the way the light dances off your hair <eos> A million colours of hazel, golden, and red <eos> Saturday morning is fading <eos> The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand <eos> My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> The weather outside's changing <eos> The leaves are buried under six inches of white <eos> The radio is playing Iron & Wine <eos> This is a new dimension <eos> This is a level where we're losing track of time <eos> I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I <eos> We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle <eos> Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow <eos> So alone in love like the world had disappeared <eos> Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go <eos> I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow <eos> And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos> Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow <eos>

Yeah... <eos> Here we go... <eos> It's a new day, but it all feels old <eos> "It's a good life!" That's what I'm told <eos> But every day, it all just feels the same <eos> At my high school, it felt more to me <eos> Like a jail cell, a penitentiary <eos> My time spent there, it only made me see <eos> That I don't ever wanna be like you <eos> I don't wanna do the things you do <eos> I'm never gonna to hear the words you say <eos> And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be <eos> You, don't wanna be just like you <eos> Uh, what I'm saying is <eos> This is the anthem, throw all your hands up <eos> You, don't wanna be you <eos> "Go to college or university <eos> Get a real job!" That's what they said to me <eos> But I could never live the way they want <eos> I'm going to get by and just do my time <eos> Out of step while they all get in line <eos> I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind <eos> Do you really wanna be like them? <eos> Do you really wanna be another trend? <eos> Do you wanna be part of that crowd? <eos> 'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be <eos> You, don't wanna be just like you <eos> Uh, what I'm saying is <eos> This is the anthem, throw all your hands up <eos> You, don't wanna be you <eos> Shake it once, that's fine <eos> Shake it twice, that's okay <eos> Shake it three times <eos> You're playing with yourself again <eos> You, don't wanna be just like you! <eos> What I'm saying is <eos> This is the anthem, throw all your hands up <eos> Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me <eos> You, don't wanna be just like you (Be just like you!) <eos> This is the anthem, throw all your hands up <eos> Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me <eos> Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh) <eos> Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh) <eos> Another loser anthem (Whoa-oh) <eos> Another loser anthem! <eos>

You ran away to find something to say <eos> I went astray to make it okay <eos> And he made it easy, darlin' <eos> I'm still in love, and I say that because <eos> I know how it seems between you and me <eos> It hasn't been easy, darlin' <eos> I can't even look at you <eos> Would you look at the space just next to your feet? <eos> The wood is warping <eos> The lines distorting <eos> This house is on fire, woo! <eos> Burning the tears right off my face <eos> What the hell did we do? <eos> Tell me we'll make it through <eos> 'Cause he made it easy, easy <eos> Please, don't leave me, leave me (Easy) <eos> What's left of the dance? <eos> The smell on my hands <eos> The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat <eos> The stranger at home, my darling <eos> (Like some kind of freak, my darling) <eos> Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone <eos> But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows <eos> You reap what you sow, my darling <eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> I can't even look at you <eos> Would you look at the space just next to your feet? <eos> The wood is warping <eos> The lines distorting <eos> This house is on fire, woo! <eos> Burning the tears right off my face <eos> What the hell did we do? <eos> Tell me we'll make it through <eos> 'Cause he made it easy, easy <eos> Please, don't leave me, don't leave me <eos> He made it easy, please, don't leave me <eos> He made it easy, please, don't leave me <eos> I can't even look at you <eos> Would you look at the space just next to your feet? <eos> The wood is warping <eos> The lines distorting <eos> This house is on fire, woo! <eos> Burning the tears right off my face <eos> What the hell did we do? <eos> Tell me we'll make it through <eos> 'Cause he made it easy, easy <eos> Please, don't leave me, no, don't leave me <eos> He made it easy <eos> Please, don't leave me <eos> He made it easy <eos> Please, don't leave me <eos> 
I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos>

Se le respeta, del señor de Culiacán carga la camiseta <eos> Los radios sonando, siempre se ponen alerta <eos> Rugen los motores y también las metralletas <eos> Todos sus muchachos firmes, fieles a la empresa <eos> Ya saben que lo que se usa aquí es la cabeza <eos> No me espanto del gobierno ni de la pobreza <eos> Y los que la deben no se acercan, nomás rezan <eos> Y lloran en el panteón <eos> Al tiro por 'onde anda, pues él es el que manda <eos> Nadie lo baja del puesto y para ser honesto <eos> Se ganó el respeto, oh-oh <eos> Y conserva su puesto, oh-oh-oh-oh <eos> En el carro va contando <eos> Pacas de las verdes es la' que va duplicando <eos> Y el que juega a traición él se lo lleva de encargo <eos> Y en la lista negra su nombre voy agregando <eos> Llenas las cuentas <eos> Conectados con los grandes mandando libretas <eos> Se les nota el porte que el muchacho representa <eos> Y el jale es calidad, por eso aumentan las ventas <eos> Si es porque él así lo decidió <eos> Compa Dan <eos> Y puros corridos tumbados, viejones <eos> Así nomás, mi compa Nata <eos> Ya sabe cómo es el rollo <eos> Su compa Oscar Maydon <eos> Representando la bandera <eos> Y puro Morales viejo, ¡eah! <eos> En camionetas blindadas, las rápidas se vieron por la sierra <eos> .50 montados, equipados pa' dar guerra <eos> Hombres listos que prefieren quedar bajo tierra <eos> Antes de fallar una misión <eos> Bien al cien con la plebada, pues no pasa nada <eos> Mandando kilos de la verde y también de lavada <eos> Todos bien activos para cualquier situación <eos> Con los radios en las manos para entrar en acción <eos> Todo está al cien con los viejos <eos> Aquí nada corre chueco, todo camina derecho <eos> Y una santa que lo cuida y esa la cuelga en el pecho <eos> La confianza me he ganado y eso lo hicieron mis hechos <eos> Ya con esta me despido <eos> Y ando cuidando el terreno y ese nunca lo descuido <eos> Culiacán, esta es mi casa, mi Sinaloa tan querido <eos> Donde tengo buen respaldo de mis más grandes amigos <eos> 
Desde morro en las calles cosas yo miré <eos> En la esquina habían velas, no podia entender <eos> Lo que iba pasando <eos> Pues, estaba muy chamaco <eos> Poco a poco con el tiempo el morro empezó a ver <eos> Le gustaron tenis Nike y vestirse bien <eos> En la casa no hay mandado <eos> Pues, tenia que ser algo <eos> Se rodeó de las pandillas y no le gustó <eos> Le gustó jugar con cuadros y sobresalió <eos> En una nave va zumbando <eos> Siempre la vida disfrutando <eos> Ahora voy paseando y me ven <eos> En una troca bien chingona por el highway <eos> Un Marlboro voy quеmando <eos> Y el pase me еstá esperando <eos> Unos tragos de Don Julio, como debe ser <eos> Hoy sonrío de la vida porque vamos bien <eos> Y no es pa' presumirles <eos> Es que es algo increíble <eos> Y pura Fuerza Regida <eos> No es pa' presumirles <eos> Otro pedo <eos> No me preocupo de la vida porque hay confort <eos> Mas nuevas casas nuevas morras, el dinero sobra <eos> Un pase pa' relajarme <eos> Así es como aguanto el desmadre <eos> Y ya llevo varios días y todavía no paro <eos> Fuerza Regida tocando, esto va pa' largo <eos> Ni pa'l lunes le paramo' <eos> En la ciudad o en el rancho <eos> Ahora voy paseando y me ven <eos> En una troca bien chingona por el highway <eos> Un Marlboro voy quemando <eos> El pase me está esperando <eos> Unos tragos de Don Julio, como debe ser <eos> Hoy sonrío de la vida porque vamos bien <eos> Y no es pa' presumirles <eos> Es que es algo increíble <eos> Y pura Fuerza Regida <eos> No es pa' presumirles <eos> Otro pedo <eos>

I never saw the end in sight <eos> Fools are kind of blind <eos> Thought everything was going alright <eos> But I was running out of time <eos> 'Cause you had one foot out the door <eos> I swear I didn't see <eos> But if you're really going away <eos> Here's some final words from me <eos> Baby, write this down, take a little note <eos> To remind you in case you didn't know <eos> Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go <eos> Write this down <eos> Take my words and read them every day <eos> Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away <eos> So you'll remember what I forgot to say <eos> Write this down <eos> I'll sign it at the bottom of the page <eos> I'll swear under oath <eos> Cause every single word is true <eos> And I think you need to know <eos> So use it as a bookmark <eos> Stick it on your refrigerator door <eos> Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel <eos> Where you'll see it for sure <eos> You can find a chisel, I can find a stone <eos> Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone <eos> Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go <eos> Baby, write this down <eos> 
Caught in my mind, I'm just a misfit <eos> Leave me to die, the world can't fix it <eos> Thought I was fine, but I'm sick <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one will help you now <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Is it just me, or is the whole world suffering? <eos> Breaking down, losing ground <eos> No one can claim they're safe now, safe now <eos> Caught in a brilliant state of mind, I <eos> Thought I was sick, but I am fine, I lied <eos> Thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos> We'll torch every street and watch the whole Earth fry <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Choose sides, theirs or mine <eos> You must decide <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, liberate the Earth from all the ones here <eos> Who've pulled the rug from under us <eos> And nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> No fear, nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Hate fills the air, stricken with a curse <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> Fear not, my dear, liberate the Earth <eos> There will be nothing left but dirt and tears <eos> I thought I was dead inside, but I survived <eos>

If you could only read my mind <eos> You would know that things between us ain't right <eos> I know your arms are open wide <eos> But you're a little on the straight side, I can't lie <eos> Your one vice <eos> Is you're too nice <eos> Come around now, can't you see? <eos> I want you, all tattooed <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complete me, mistreat me <eos> Want you to be bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> If you could only read my mind <eos> You would know that I've been waiting <eos> So long <eos> For someone almost just like you <eos> But with attitude, I'm waiting <eos> So come on <eos> Get out of clothes time <eos> Grow out those highlights <eos> Come around now, can't you see? <eos> I want you, in a vinyl suit <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complicated, x-rated <eos> I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> Bad <eos> Don't get me wrong <eos> I know you're only being good <eos> But that's what's wrong <eos> I guess I just misunderstood <eos> I want you, all tattooed <eos> I want you bad <eos> Complicated, x-rated <eos> I want you bad <eos> I mean it, I need it <eos> I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad <eos> Bad, really, really bad <eos> 
I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater <eos> You said it looked better on me than it did you <eos> Only if you knew, how much I liked you <eos> But I watch your eyes as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> (Wish I were Heather) <eos> Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand <eos> Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder <eos> But how could I hate her? She's such an angel <eos> But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she <eos> Walks by <eos> What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky <eos> She's got you mesmerized while I die <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> (I wish I were Heather) <eos> (Oh) Wish I were Heather <eos> (Oh, oh) Wish I were Heather <eos> Why would you ever kiss me? <eos> I'm not even half as pretty <eos> You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester <eos> But you like her better <eos> Wish I were <eos>

When I was a boy I learned not to cry <eos> My daddy would scream <eos> I learned how to hide <eos> That fool cut off this ribbon of mine <eos> Leading me back before we unwind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> I learned how to do better each time <eos> I buried this heart and years went on by <eos> But what do you do when there's nothing inside? <eos> Lost in the dirt covered in vines <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> This bone will break along a line <eos> Been drawn for a long time <eos> Time <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> Touch me and then teach me how to cry <eos> If you ever change your mind <eos> 
Well, if you wanted honesty <eos> That's all you had to say <eos> I never want to let you down <eos> Or have you go, it's better off this way <eos> For all the dirty looks <eos> The photographs your boyfriend took <eos> Remember when you broke your foot <eos> From jumping out the second floor? <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay <eos> You wear me out <eos> What will it take to show you <eos> That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay) <eos> I've told you time and time again <eos> You sing the words, but don't know what it means (I'm not okay) <eos> To be a joke and look <eos> Another line without a hook <eos> I held you close as we both shook <eos> For the last time, take a good hard look <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay <eos> You wear me out <eos> Forget about the dirty looks <eos> The photographs your boyfriend took <eos> You said you read me like a book <eos> But the pages all are torn and frayed now! <eos> But I'm okay, I'm okay! <eos> I'm okay now, "I'm okay now," but you really need to <eos> Listen to me, because I'm telling you the truth! <eos> I mean this, I'm okay! "Trust me..." <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay, well, I'm not okay, I'm not o-fucking-kay! <eos> I'm not okay <eos> I'm not okay... <eos> 
You’re a sweetheart <eos> And I love you <eos> But that don’t mean <eos> That I trust you <eos> And there’s no bit <eos> Of alignment <eos> In the things you say and do <eos> Look babe if you really want the truth <eos> I could count on one hand the times I could count on you <eos> And still have all five of my fingers left to use <eos> Cancelled all of my plans with my friends just for you <eos> But hey (Hey) <eos> You know what? (What) <eos> It’s all good <eos> Don’t let it keep you up at night <eos> I don’t want you wondering why <eos> I’m out the door without goodbyes <eos> It’s all good <eos> No use in turning on your light <eos> If you can’t see by now, you’re blind <eos> But hey, you know what? <eos> I still love the tattoo <eos> On my left side <eos> Even if you get one <eos> Just like it with the next guy <eos> Made assumptions <eos> Well, I guessed right <eos> You said “I love you” <eos> Oof that was your best lie <eos> I could count on one hand the times I could count on you <eos> And still have all five of my fingers left to use <eos> Cancelled all of my plans with my friends just for you <eos> But hey (Hey) <eos> You know what? (What) <eos> It’s all good <eos> Don’t let it keep you up at night <eos> I don’t want you wondering why <eos> I’m out the door without goodbyes <eos> It’s all good <eos> No use in turning on your light <eos> If you can’t see by now, you’re blind <eos> But hey, you know what? <eos> It’s all good <eos> Don’t let it keep you up at night <eos> I don’t want you wondering why <eos> I’m out the door without goodbyes <eos> It’s all good <eos> No use in turning on your light <eos> If you can’t see by now, you’re blind <eos> But hey, you know what? <eos> It’s all good <eos>

I was born in Lil' Rock <eos> Had a childhood sweetheart <eos> We were always hand in hand <eos> I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails <eos> Suzy was in pigtails <eos> I knew I loved her even then <eos> You know my papa disapproved it <eos> My mama boo-hooed it <eos> But I told them time and time again <eos> "Don't you know I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her" <eos> Yeah! Hey, hey, hey <eos> She's been my inspiration <eos> Showed appreciation <eos> For the love I gave her through the years <eos> Like a sweet magnolia tree <eos> My love blossomed tenderly <eos> My life grew sweeter through the years <eos> I know that my baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> That's why we made it through the years <eos> I was made to love her <eos> Worship and adore her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> All through thick and thin <eos> Our love just won't end <eos> 'Cause I love my baby, love my baby, hey <eos> My baby loves me <eos> My baby needs me <eos> And I know I ain't going nowhere <eos> I was knee-high to a chicken <eos> When that love bug bit me <eos> I had the fever with each passing year <eos> Oh, even if the mountain tumbles <eos> If this whole world crumbles <eos> By her side I'll still be standing there <eos> 'Cause I was made to love her <eos> I was made to live for her, yeah! <eos> Ah, I was made to love her <eos> Build my world all around her <eos> Hey, hey, hey <eos> Ooh baby, I was made to please her <eos> You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no <eos> Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby <eos> 
Ow! <eos> Heeey, yeah! <eos> I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure <eos> And I just can't wait 'till the day when you knock on my door <eos> Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down <eos> 'Cause I just can't wait 'till you write me you're coming around <eos> Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, yeah <eos> I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true <eos> And I don't want to spend my whole life just a-waiting for you <eos> Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no <eos> I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay <eos> Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Yeah, oh yeah <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Walking on sunshine <eos> Walking on sunshine <eos> I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <eos> I feel alive, I feel the love, I feel the love that's really real <eos> I'm on sunshine, baby, oh <eos> Oh, yeah, I'm on sunshine, baby <eos> Ow! <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, all right now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> I say it, I say it, I say it again, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hey, yeah, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> I say it, I say it, I say it again, now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> And tell me, tell me, tell me it again now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> Hooooh, yeah now <eos> And don't it feel good <eos> And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good <eos> Hooooh, yeah, Hooooh, yeah, Hooooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <eos> 
Someday at Christmas <eos> Men won't be boys <eos> Playing with balms like kids play with toys <eos> One warm December <eos> Our hearts will see <eos> A world where men are free <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no wars <eos> When we have learned <eos> What Christmas is for <eos> When we have found <eos> What life's really worth <eos> They'll be peace on Earth <eos> Someday all are dreams will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> We'll see a land <eos> With no hungry children <eos> And no empty hands <eos> One happy morning <eos> Where people will share <eos> A world where people care <eos> Someday at Christmas <eos> They'll be no tears <eos> All men are equal <eos> And no men have no fears <eos> One shinning moment <eos> One prayer away from our world today <eos> Well someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time <eos> Oh someday at Christmas <eos> Men will not fail <eos> Hate will be gone and love will prevail <eos> Someday a new world we can start <eos> With hope in every heart <eos> Someday at Christmas will come to be <eos> Someday in a world where all men are free <eos> Maybe not in time for you and me <eos> But someday at Christmas time oh <eos> But someday oh at Christmas time woo <eos> 
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening <eos> In the lane, snow is glistening <eos> A beautiful sight <eos> We're happy tonight <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> And gone away (gone away) is the bluebird (is the bluebird) <eos> But here to stay stay stay is a new bird <eos> He sings a love song <eos> As we go along <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> And pretend that he is Parson Brown <eos> He'll say: Are you married? <eos> We'll say: No man <eos> But you can do the job <eos> When you're in town <eos> Later on (later on! ), we'll conspire <eos> As we dream by the fire, babe <eos> We'll face unafraid <eos> All the plans that we've made <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> In the meadow we can build a snowman <eos> And pretend that he's Parson Brown <eos> He'll say: Are you married? <eos> We'll say: No man <eos> But you can do the job <eos> When you're in town <eos> And later on (later on! ), we'll conspire <eos> As we dream by the fire <eos> We'll face unafraid <eos> All the plans that we've made <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> We'll face unafraid <eos> All the plans that we've made <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> We'll face unafraid <eos> All the plans that we've made <eos> We're walking in a winter wonderland <eos> (Walking in a winter wonderland.) <eos>

Tell me something, give me hope for the night <eos> We don't know how we feel <eos> We're just praying that we're doing this right <eos> Though that's not the way it seems <eos> Summer gone, now winter's on its way <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> I will miss the days we had <eos> The days we had <eos> Oh, I'll miss the days we had <eos> Loving, leaving, it's too late for this now <eos> Such esteem for each has gone <eos> Has time driven our season away? <eos> Cause that's the way it seems <eos> In the world of the speech that is new <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> Again to stay <eos> I'll be back again to stay <eos> 
All my friends are movin' on <eos> Getting hitched and then they're gone <eos> And I'm alone, all alone <eos> I'm in the same room as before <eos> With mom and dad right next door <eos> And I'm scared I might be here forever <eos> I love them but some ties need to be severed <eos> And I said I'd move out last year <eos> So why the hell am I still here <eos> And it's easy to say I'm okay <eos> But this smile I'm wearing is fake <eos> I'm suffocating <eos> Living Groundhog Day <eos> Day after day, day after day, day after day <eos> And I think I'm gonna brеak <eos> My friend's baby's on the way <eos> Just 22 but should I do the samе? <eos> But I'm broke and unemployed <eos> Another night staring straight into the void and <eos> I just wanna drive away <eos> But I don't have a car so I guess I gotta stay <eos> And it's easy to say I'm okay <eos> Up and down these emotional waves <eos> I'm sick and tired of living Groundhog Day <eos> Day after day, day after day, day after day <eos> And I think I'm gonna break <eos> Day after day <eos> Day after day <eos> Day after day <eos> Day after day <eos> Day after day <eos> Day after day <eos> And it's easy to say I'm ok <eos> But the smile I'm wearing is fake <eos> I'm suffocating <eos> Living Groundhog Day <eos> Day after, day after day, day after day <eos> And I think I'm gonna break <eos> And I think I'm gonna break <eos> 
I've seen El Paso and the sky was on fire <eos> Lost a night in Juarez a couple of times <eos> Danced with a cowboy on a straight tequila high <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed <eos> Waiting for the right one to come find me <eos> But the wrong one always set me free <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he playing in some house band in Dallas? <eos> Is he breaking horses in San Antone? <eos> Is he all alone in the neon light? <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> Is he praying for rain out in West Texas? <eos> Is he lost in the Marfa lights? <eos> Is he out there looking for me <eos> Wishing I was in his arms tonight <eos> I wish I was in his arms tonight <eos> 
Take me to your place in space <eos> I'm sick and tired of the rat race <eos> On rocket ship, no time to wait <eos> I just want to gravitate <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone <eos> I'll take you out to see the place <eos> Where the man and the moon has a smilin' face (oh yeah) <eos> You don't have to wear no fancy lace <eos> Just a funky feel and a lot of taste <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone <eos> People movin' to and fro <eos> To a sonic band, and a laser show <eos> Superman, Batman, blowin' all night <eos> Playin' one on one with a meteorite <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> It's gone, gone, gone <eos> Ninth dimension, seventh plane <eos> Out here raising solar Cain <eos> The star patrol said keep it down (keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down) <eos> As long as we're cool, we can stay in town <eos> And as long as we're cool, we can stay around <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's out of sight <eos> (It's out of sight) <eos> It's gone <eos> (In the galaxy) <eos> It's gone <eos> (At the galaxy) <eos> 
Que podre decirte <eos> En el corto tiempo <eos> En que se vive una ilusion <eos> Que podre dejarte <eos> Tan pegado al alma <eos> Que se quede ahi en tu corazon <eos> Yo no pretendo enseñarte <eos> Lo que es el mundo me falta tambien <eos> Pero vale la pena disfrutar cada dia <eos> Porque me has regalado el privilegio de amarte <eos> Di lo que sientas <eos> Has lo que piensas <eos> Da lo que tengas <eos> Y no te arrepientas <eos> Y si no llega lo que esperabas <eos> No te conformes jamas te detengas <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas nunca te olvides de Dios <eos> Seras del tamaño <eos> De tus pensamientos <eos> No te permitas fracasar <eos> Lo mas importante <eos> Son los sentimientos y lo que no puedes comprar <eos> Y cuando llegue el momento <eos> En que tu sola quisieras volar <eos> Aunque no estemos juntos <eos> Estaran los recuerdos que con solo quererlo <eos> Volveras a vivirlos <eos> Di lo que sientas has lo que piensas <eos> Da lo que tengas y no te arrepientas <eos> No te limites por lo que digan <eos> Se lo que quieras pero se tu misma <eos> Y si no llega lo que esperabas <eos> No te conformes jamas te detengas <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas nunca te olvides de dios <eos> Pero sobre todas las cosas como te quiero: <eos> Mi amor... <eos> 
Have a holly, jolly Christmas <eos> It's the best time of the year <eos> I don't know if there'll be snow <eos> But have a cup of cheer <eos> Have a holly, jolly Christmas <eos> And when you walk down the street <eos> Say Hello to friends you know <eos> And everyone you meet <eos> Oh, ho, the mistletoe <eos> Is hung where you can see <eos> Somebody waits for you <eos> Kiss her once for me <eos> Have a holly, jolly Christmas <eos> And in case you didn't hear <eos> Oh by golly, have a holly <eos> Jolly Christmas this year <eos> Oh, ho, the mistletoe <eos> Is hung where you can see <eos> Somebody waits for you <eos> Kiss her once for me <eos> Have a holly, jolly Christmas <eos> And in case you didn't hear <eos> Oh by golly, have a holly <eos> Jolly Christmas this year <eos> 
An ancient warmth <eos> Under the horizon <eos> Given signs of lights <eos> A solid rising <eos> I knew the void would come to be <eos> I never thought it would complete me <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> Leaves all over me <eos> Buried alive <eos> Flowers of sulfur <eos> A dark future ahead <eos> The words I speak <eos> Will feed the disease <eos> Fragments of old scriptures <eos> Will shape new belief <eos> Pretended tears <eos> Past time <eos> Abandoned souls <eos> In such a place <eos> It wasn't always marked by the dark <eos> Once the sun belonged to the stars <eos> The silence surrounded us and <eos> Numbers existed just in minds <eos> In between everything, all, nothing can change <eos> It's such a shame <eos> I missed the rain <eos> That would have taken me far away <eos> A last glance at those lights <eos> I knew I could be moved <eos> I knew that this age was doomed <eos> 
If you don't wanna see me <eos> Did a full one-eighty, crazy <eos> Thinking 'bout the way I was <eos> Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe <eos> But look at where I ended up <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not where you left me at all, so <eos> If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up, don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away, you know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Aren't you the guy who tried to <eos> Hurt me with the word "goodbye"? <eos> Though it took some time to survive you <eos> I'm better on the other side <eos> I'm all good already <eos> So moved on, it's scary <eos> I'm not where you left me at all, so <eos> If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> (Don't, don't, don't) <eos> Don't show up, don't come out <eos> Don't start caring about me now <eos> Walk away, you know how <eos> Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me) <eos> Up, up <eos> Don't come out, out, out <eos> Don't show up, up, up <eos> Don't start now (Oh) <eos> Up, up <eos> Don't come out, out <eos> I'm not where you left me at all, so <eos> If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody <eos> If you wanna believe that anything could stop me <eos> Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out) <eos> Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now) <eos> Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how) <eos> Don't start caring about me now (So) <eos> Up, up <eos> Don't come out, out, out <eos> Don't show up, up, up <eos> Walk away, walk away (So) <eos> Up, up <eos> Don't come out, out, out <eos> Don't show up, up, up <eos> Walk away, walk away, oh <eos> 
I, I hope she makes you smile <eos> The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone <eos> In the middle of a highway driving alone <eos> Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song <eos> That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her <eos> Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend <eos> Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him <eos> I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone <eos> And then she calls <eos> And baby, I, I hope you work it out <eos> Forgive and just about forget <eos> And take her on a first date again <eos> And when you lean in for a kiss <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> I hope what goes comes all the way around <eos> I hope she makes you feel the same way about her <eos> That I feel about you right now <eos> I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive <eos> I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night <eos> I hope you never ever felt more free <eos> Tell your friends that you're so happy <eos> I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans <eos> I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand <eos> I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams <eos> She's everything you're ever gonna need <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> And then I hope she cheats <eos> Like you did on me <eos> Like you did on me <eos> 
Yelling at the sky <eos> Screaming at the world <eos> Baby, why'd you go away? <eos> I’m still your girl <eos> Holding on too tight <eos> Head up in the clouds <eos> Heaven only knows where you are now <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Never got the chance <eos> To say your last goodbye <eos> I gotta move on <eos> But it hurts to try <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I’m alright <eos> Baby, you’re just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I’m dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> 
At a certain speed on the interstate <eos> Everything looks the same <eos> The blurry green helps me meditate <eos> When everything's always changing <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I took a ride down the boulеvard <eos> To see where we usеd to hang <eos> It's worn down like the rest of us <eos> But that's a quick coat o' paint <eos> I'm doin' buck 20 on I-75, 75, 75 <eos> Just to see if I'm dead or alive <eos> Dead or alive, dead or alive <eos> 'Cause I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need <eos> My mind's racing <eos> Yeah, I just need some four-wheel isolation <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I can't afford that vacation <eos> And you can't see the skyline from the basement <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> Yeah, you always remind me <eos> I know I got you <eos> And you know you got me <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need (We got everything we need) <eos> I know I got you (I know I got you) <eos> And you know you got me (You know you got me) <eos> We got everything we need <eos> We got everything we need, yeah <eos> Ah, ah, ah, ah <eos> Ah, ah <eos>

She burns <eos> Today's on fire <eos> The sky is bleeding above me, and I am blistered <eos> I walk these lines of blasphemy every day <eos> And still <eos> Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her <eos> She's the only one who knows what it is to burn <eos> I feel diseased <eos> Is there no sympathy from the sun? <eos> The sky's still fire <eos> But I am safe in here from the world outside <eos> So tell me <eos> What's the price to pay for glory? <eos> Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her <eos> She's the only one who knows what it is to burn <eos> Today is fire, and she burns <eos> Today is fire, and she burns <eos> She burns <eos> She burns <eos> She burns <eos> She burns <eos> She burns <eos> She burns <eos> Like a bad star, I'm falling faster down to her <eos> She's the only one who knows what it is to burn <eos> 
We should let the mud consume this thing we built <eos> 80 years of drooling turned to streams of filth <eos> Wounds appearing underneath the skin we killed <eos> Head mounted sideways to shun the guilt <eos> Swirling daggers carve their way to open space <eos> Pointy nails embedded into ashtrays <eos> Promises of healing failed to be fulfilled <eos> Head mounted sideways to shun the guilt <eos> Bring out your forces <eos> Bring out your crosses now <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> To see through fingеrs the purge that lingers on <eos> Thеre’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> Bring back my bed <eos> Bring back the voice that fled <eos> Bring back my name <eos> Replay my talkshow game <eos> Bring out your forces <eos> Bring out your crosses now <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> To see through fingers the purge that lingers on <eos> There’s a lifeline breaking in this frost <eos> Blood has been spilled <eos> I’m saying goodbye for now... <eos> Watching the mill <eos> Turning around somehow... <eos> Blood has been spilled <eos> I’m saying goodbye for now... <eos> 
Yeah <eos> I wake up every morning with my head up in a daze <eos> I'm not sure if I should say this, fuck, I'll say it anyway <eos> Everybody tries to tell me that I'm goin' through a phase <eos> I don't know if it's a phase, I just wanna feel okay, yeah <eos> I battle with depression, but the question still remains <eos> Is this post-traumatic stressin' or am I suppressin' rage? <eos> And my doctor tries to tell me that I'm going through a phase <eos> Yeah, it's not a fuckin' phase, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day <eos> And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I think I'm going nowhere like a rat trapped in a maze <eos> Every wall that I knock down is just a wall that I'll replace <eos> I'm in a race against myself, I try to keep a steady pace <eos> How the fuck will I escape if I never close my case? <eos> Oh my God, I keep on stressin', every second that I waste <eos> Is another second sooner to a blessing I won't take <eos> But my therapist will tell me that I'm going through a stage <eos> Yeah, it's not a fucking stage, I just wanna feel okay <eos> Okay, motherfucker, now you got my attention <eos> I need to change a couple things 'cause somethin' is missing <eos> And what if I were to lie? Tell you everything is fine <eos> Every single fucking day I get closer to the grave <eos> I am terrified, I fell asleep at the wheel again <eos> Crashed my car just to feel again <eos> It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular fucking monster, yeah <eos> Yeah, here we go again, motherfucker, oh <eos> We're sick and tired of wondering <eos> Praying to a god that you don't believe <eos> You're searching for the truth in the lost and found <eos> So the question I ask is, yeah, where the fuck is your god now? <eos> 'Cause I'm about to break down <eos> I'm searchin' for a way out <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I break down <eos> Falling into love now <eos> With falling apart <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer <eos> I'm a popular, popular monster <eos> 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Let your heart be light <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be out of sight <eos> Have yourself a merry little Christmas <eos> Make the Yuletide gay <eos> Next year all our troubles <eos> Will be miles away <eos> Once again as in olden days <eos> Happy golden days of yore <eos> Faithful friends who are dear to us <eos> Will be near to us once more <eos> Someday soon we all will be together <eos> If the fates allow <eos> Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow <eos> So have yourself a merry little Christmas now <eos> 
I was just a wandering soul <eos> Working through the highs and lows <eos> I heard a spirit whisper slow <eos> Drift into a great unknown <eos> Will anybody see my ghost? <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I began to hear my name <eos> And silence in a hurricane <eos> The dust was leaving from my veins <eos> Like some forgotten border train <eos> Carried to my home again <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> I wade in darkness <eos> But I can feel you calling, hear you calling <eos> As I shut my wanting eyes <eos> I said I'd love you 'till I die <eos> Ah <eos> I can see the light <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> So let me off at the end of the night <eos> Because all my friends are giving up <eos> And I've had enough <eos> Ooooo oo oo <eos> I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me <eos> 
Over the moon, under the stars <eos> Feel them arresting me, unknowables <eos> Fading at dawn, troubles too <eos> Dimness sustains, oh, the regret <eos> I could be lost to you, lost in thought <eos> Sending a kiss back to the sky <eos> So has my world become run out of breath <eos> I'm not the only one to lose a friend <eos> Where do you go? You're going home <eos> What do I do with the void in your shape <eos> Leaving me frailty, a drop and I break <eos> What do I do with half of myself? <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I could be loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> And then when the stars align with some kind of peace <eos> I know I'm loved by you, either way <eos> Where did you go? You’re going home <eos> You’re going home <eos>

Is it worth it? Can you even hear me? <eos> Standing with your spotlight on me <eos> Not enough to feed the hungry <eos> I'm tired, and I felt it for a while now <eos> In this sea of lonely <eos> The taste of ink is getting old, it's <eos> Four o' clock in the fucking morning <eos> Each day gets more and more like the last day <eos> Still I can see it coming <eos> While I'm standing in the river drowning <eos> This could be my chance to break out <eos> This could be my chance to say goodbye <eos> At last, it's finally over <eos> Couldn't take this town much longer <eos> Being half-dead wasn't what I planned to be <eos> Now I'm ready to be free <eos> So here I am, it's in my hands <eos> And I'll savor every moment of this <eos> So here I am, alive at last <eos> And I'll savor every moment of this <eos> Don't you think I'm pretty <eos> When I'm standing top the bright-lit city? <eos> And I'll take your hand and pick you up <eos> And keep you there so you can see it <eos> So long as you're alive and care <eos> I promise I will take you there <eos> We'll drink and dance the night away <eos> We can drink and dance the night away <eos> So here I am, it's in my hands <eos> And I'll savor every moment of this <eos> So here I am, alive at last <eos> And I'll savor every moment of this, I'll savor every moment of this <eos> As long as you're alive, here I am <eos> I promise I will take you there <eos> As long as you're alive, here I am <eos> I promise I will take you there <eos> Don't you think I'm pretty <eos> When I'm standing top the bright-lit city? <eos> And I'll take your hand and pick you up <eos> And keep you there so you can see it <eos> As long as you're alive and care <eos> I promise I will take you there <eos> So long as you're alive and care <eos> I promise I will take you there <eos> So here I am, it's in my hands <eos> And I'll savor every moment of this <eos> So here I am, alive at last, and I'll savor every moment of this <eos> Savor every moment of this, savor every moment of this! <eos>

If I leave here tomorrow <eos> Would you still remember me? <eos> For I must be traveling on, now <eos> 'Cause there's too many places I've got to see <eos> But if I stay here with you, girl <eos> Things just couldn't be the same <eos> 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now <eos> And this bird you cannot change <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> And the bird you cannot change <eos> And this bird you cannot change <eos> Lord knows, I can't change <eos> Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah yeah <eos> Though this feeling I can't change <eos> But please don't take it so badly <eos> 'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame <eos> But, if I stay here with you, girl <eos> Things just couldn't be the same <eos> 'Cause I'm as free as a bird now <eos> And this bird you'll never change <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> And the bird you cannot change <eos> And this bird you cannot change <eos> Lord knows, I can't change <eos> Lord help me, I can't change <eos> Lord, I can't change <eos> Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah <eos> 
Cross off the days gone <eos> Cross off the days gone <eos> Gone by <eos> Wasting away <eos> A self-inflicted slow decay <eos> What should've been, what never was <eos> Became the end for both of us <eos> Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger) <eos> Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger) <eos> So lay them all to waste <eos> Years you decided to erase <eos> And cross off the days <eos> So black out and hide behind the lines <eos> Keep staring down the sun and hope the <eos> Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cutting you free <eos> The phantom limb was part of me <eos> You have lived, you have lost <eos> The separation's worth the cost <eos> Heavy are the words that go unspoken (Spoken) <eos> Heavy are the promises now broken (Broken) <eos> Will you learn to love the taste <eos> Of the destruction in your wake? <eos> Cross off the days <eos> So black out and hide behind the lines <eos> Keep staring down the sun and hope the <eos> Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone <eos> Gone by <eos> Making my way back from the madness <eos> Shifting my thoughts from the blackness <eos> And the sadness, but the fact is <eos> I'm swinging through life like a clenched fist <eos> Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed <eos> Can't kill the pain, it's everything <eos> It's all I feel, it's what I breathe <eos> Turn the hate I breed into what I need <eos> Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger) <eos> Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger) <eos> Did you survey everything you laid to waste <eos> And cross off the days? <eos> So black out and hide behind the lines <eos> Keep staring down the sun and hope the <eos> Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> Cross off the days gone by <eos> 
The second we walked in the front door <eos> I was ready to sneak out the back <eos> Everyone came here with someone <eos> But I can tell they all want what we have <eos> They all know when you're in the room <eos> 'Cause they can't take their eyes off you <eos> And neither can I tonight <eos> Never wanna be a hater <eos> But you know I hate this party <eos> Never wanna be a taker <eos> But I kinda wanna take you home <eos> Nеver wanna be the bad guy <eos> But you know I want you bad tonight <eos> Your drеss and I got plans to make you fall on my floor <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be, never wanna be <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be <eos> With anybody but you <eos> With anybody but you, ooh <eos> I drove all night just to see you <eos> Not to see all of our friends <eos> And there's enough wine back at my place <eos> To party and not have to pretend <eos> That we wanna hear all their stories <eos> When I wanna just disappear <eos> Get the hell out of here tonight <eos> Never wanna be a hater <eos> But you know I hate this party <eos> Never wanna be a taker <eos> But I kinda wanna take you home <eos> Never wanna be the bad guy <eos> But you know I want you bad tonight <eos> Your dress and I got plans to make you fall on my floor <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be, never wanna be <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be <eos> With anybody but you <eos> With anybody but you, ooh <eos> I never wanna be somebody without you <eos> And I never wanna be the guy that lets you down <eos> I never wanna be somebody without you <eos> I always wanna be the guy you want around <eos> Never wanna be a hater <eos> But you know I hate this party <eos> Never wanna be a taker <eos> But I kinda wanna take you home <eos> Never wanna be the bad guy <eos> But you know I want you bad tonight <eos> Your dress and I got plans to make you fall on my floor <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be, never wanna be <eos> Yeah, I never wanna be <eos> With anybody but you <eos> With anybody but you, ooh <eos> I never wanna be somebody without you <eos> 
Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago <eos> Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator. Tommy the cat had many a story to tell, but it was a rare occasion such as this that he did <eos> She came a'sliding on down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot Biscuit. The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of Tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days. The sight was beyond belief. Many a head snapped for double even triple, takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbys were known to hang out. They hung out in droves. Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place... and that was O'malley's Alley. <eos> The air was thick with cat calls (no pun intended) But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway. She knew what she wanted. She was looking for that stud bull. She was looking for that He-cat. And that was me. Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee: <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say b-b-b-b-b-b-b-baby <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby do you wanna lay down by my side? <eos> Ah baby do you wanna lay down with me? <eos> Say baby! <eos> Say baby! <eos> 
Y una bolsita para dar el levantón <eos> Y un botecito que me quema con frío <eos> Tres, cuatro barbies bien preciosas pa' bailar <eos> El solecito a lo lejos veo pasar <eos> Me pasa mi compa un tabaco pa' enbaisar <eos> El corazón siento me empieza a palpitar <eos> Llevaba tiempo sin eso experimentar <eos> No sé que es eso creo dicen mariposas <eos> Llevo un buen rato y no la dejo de mirar <eos> Labios hermosos su rostro espectacular <eos> Me acerco y la neta no sé si saludar <eos> Pero no es malo mejor me voy a aventar <eos> Que hermosa niña créanme que fue la verdad <eos> Toqué su hombro y al instante me mira <eos> Su mano pega y me lleva junto a bailar <eos> Me tenía loco la forma de su mirar <eos> Y al paso en que ella se me pega y me pone a bailar <eos> Su cuerpo pegadito al mío me hace ya vibrar <eos> Tengo yo miedo y no me quiero enamorar <eos> Pero ya es tarde y créanme que esto me gusta <eos> Dos, tres canciones y no para de bailar <eos> No me interesa mientras este junto a ella <eos> Tres, cuatro tragos y la fiesta mejora <eos> Nos conocimos mientras la rola suena <eos> Ya ni les cuento ya saben lo que pasó <eos> Rodó en mi cama y justo cuando el Sol salió <eos> Dormimos juntos me tenía bien loco <eos> Y aquí termina la historia de este cuento <eos> Aquí sigo en el antro fumando un gallo <eos> Siempre observando por si es que me la topo <eos> Pasan los días y no la he vuelto a mirar <eos> A Dios le rezo pa' que la haga ya llegar <eos> Cierro los ojos y me acuerdo de su carita <eos> Como bailaba sonreía y de ese mirar <eos> Luna dile tú que a ella la puedes mirar <eos> Dile que vuelva y aquí la voy a esperar <eos>

I got my driver's license last week <eos> Just like we always talked about <eos> 'Cause you were so excited for me <eos> To finally drive up to your house <eos> But today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> Crying 'cause you weren't around <eos> And you're probably with that blonde girl <eos> Who always made me doubt <eos> She's so much older than me <eos> She's everything I'm insecure about <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> 'Cause how could I ever love someone else? <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> And all my friends are tired <eos> Of hearing how much I miss you, but <eos> I kinda feel sorry for them <eos> 'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do <eos> Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs <eos> And pictured I was driving home to you <eos> And I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one, oh <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Red lights, stop signs <eos> I still see your face in the white cars, front yards <eos> Can't drive past the places we used to go to <eos> 'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> Sidewalks we crossed <eos> I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing <eos> Over all the noise <eos> God, I'm so blue, know we're through <eos> But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) <eos> I know we weren't perfect <eos> But I've never felt this way for no one <eos> And I just can't imagine <eos> How you could be so okay now that I'm gone <eos> Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me <eos> 'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street <eos> 
Deutsch <eos> TEXT: Ernst Anschütz, 1824 <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> Du grünst nicht nur <eos> Zur Sommerzeit <eos> Nein auch im Winter, wenn es schneit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum <eos> Wie treu sind deine Blätter! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit <eos> Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Du kannst mir sehr gefallen! <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Dein Kleid will mich <eos> Was lehren: <eos> Die Hoffnung und Beständigkeit <eos> Gibt Trost und Kraft <eos> Zu jeder Zeit <eos> O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum! <eos> Das soll dein Kleid <eos> Mich lehren <eos> English <eos> Literal English translation <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> You're green not only <eos> In the summertime <eos> No, also in winter when it snows <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> How loyal are your leaves/needles! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> How often has not at Christmastime <eos> A tree like you given me such joy! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> You can please me very much! <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> Your dress wants to <eos> Teach me something: <eos> Your hope and durability <eos> Provide comfort and strength <eos> At any time <eos> O Christmas tree, o Christmas tree <eos> That's what your dress should <eos> Teach me <eos> 
I take a little smoke in the evenin' <eos> I take a little whiskey on ice <eos> I never get behind on killin' my mind <eos> It's just the kind of things I like <eos> Just the kind of things I like <eos> The minute that I saw you walkin' over <eos> I figured I was diggin' my grave <eos> Well, you had the shovel, I knew you were trouble <eos> But you're just the kind of trouble I crave <eos> Just the kind of trouble I crave <eos> And mama always set a good example <eos> Daddy always gave me good advice <eos> Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction <eos> But the devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me think <eos> Someday I'm goin' six feet under <eos> And when I'm standin' at the gate <eos> They'll tally up my sins, they won't let me in <eos> Sayin' "Son, you're just a little too late" <eos> "Son, you're just a little too late" <eos> My mama always set a good example <eos> Daddy always gave me good advice <eos> Jesus tried to steer me in the right direction <eos> But the devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me <eos> Devil always made me <eos> Devil always made me think twice <eos> Devil always made me <eos> Devil always made me <eos> Devil always made me think twice <eos> 
Well I got a candle, and I've got a spoon <eos> I live in a hallway with no doors, and no rooms <eos> And under the window sill, they all were found <eos> A touch of concrete within a doorway, without a sound <eos> Someone save me if you will <eos> And take away, all these pills <eos> And please just save me, if you can <eos> From my blasphemy, in my wasteland <eos> How did I get here, and what went wrong <eos> Couldn't handle forgiveness, now I'm far, beyond gone <eos> And I can hardly remember, the look of my own eyes <eos> How could I love this, my life's so dishonest, it made me compromise <eos> Someone save me if you will <eos> And take away, all these pills <eos> And please just save me, if you can <eos> From my blasphemy in my wasteland <eos> Jump in the water <eos> Jump in with me <eos> Jump on the altar <eos> Lay down with me <eos> The hardest question, to answer <eos> Is why, why <eos> Someone save me if you will <eos> And take away, all these pills <eos> And please just save me, if you can <eos> From my blasphemy in my wasteland <eos> Somebody save me <eos> Somebody save me <eos> Somebody save me <eos> Somebody save me <eos> Somebody save me <eos> Please don't erase me <eos>

Once upon a time you dressed so fine <eos> Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you? <eos> People call, say "Beware doll, you're bound to fall" <eos> You thought they were all a-kiddin' you <eos> You used to laugh about <eos> Everybody that was hangin' out <eos> Now you don't talk so loud <eos> Now you don't seem so proud <eos> About having to be scrounging your next meal <eos> How does it feel? <eos> How does it feel? <eos> To be without a home? <eos> Like a complete unknown? <eos> Like a rolling stone? <eos> Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely <eos> But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it <eos> Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street <eos> And now you’re gonna have to get used to it <eos> You say you never compromise <eos> With the mystery tramp, but now you realize <eos> He's not selling any alibis <eos> As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes <eos> And say, “Do you want to make a deal?" <eos> How does it feel? <eos> How does it feel? <eos> To be on your own <eos> With no direction home <eos> A complete unknown <eos> Like a rolling stone? <eos> Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns <eos> On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you <eos> Never understood that it ain't no good <eos> You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you <eos> You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat <eos> Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat <eos> Ain't it hard when you discover that <eos> He really wasn't where it's at <eos> After he took from you everything he could steal? <eos> How does it feel? <eos> How does it feel? <eos> To hang on your own <eos> With no direction home <eos> Like a complete unknown <eos> Like a rolling stone? <eos> Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people <eos> They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made <eos> Exchangin' all precious gifts <eos> But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe <eos> You used to be so amused <eos> At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used <eos> Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse <eos> When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose <eos> You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal <eos> How does it feel? <eos> Aw, how does it feel? <eos> To be on your own <eos> With no direction home <eos> Like a complete unknown <eos> Like a rolling stone? <eos>

(Verse 1 : ) <eos> I call you <eos> When I need you <eos> My heart's on fire <eos> You come to me <eos> Come to me <eos> Wild and wired <eos> Oh, you come to me <eos> Give me everything I need <eos> You bring a lifetime of promises <eos> And a world of dreams <eos> You speak the language of love <eos> Like you know what it means <eos> And it can't be wrong <eos> Take my heart and make it strong <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart baby <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Verse 2 : ) <eos> In your heart I see <eos> The start of every night and every day <eos> In your eyes I get lost <eos> I get washed away <eos> Just as long as I'm here in your arms <eos> I could be in no better place <eos> (Chorus : ) <eos> You're simply the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Bridge : ) <eos> Each time you leave me <eos> I start losing control <eos> You're walking away <eos> With my heart and my soul <eos> I can feel it even when I'm alone <eos> Oh baby, don't let go <eos> (Chorus :) <eos> You're the best <eos> Better than all the rest <eos> Better than anyone <eos> Anyone I ever met <eos> Ooh, I'm stuck on your heart <eos> I hang on every word you say <eos> Oh, tear us apart, no, no <eos> Baby, I would rather be dead <eos> (Outro :) <eos> You're the best <eos> 
When your legs don't work like they used to before <eos> And I can't sweep you off of your feet <eos> Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? <eos> Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? <eos> And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy <eos> And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout how <eos> People fall in love in mysterious ways <eos> Maybe just the touch of a hand <eos> Well me, I fall in love with you every single day <eos> I just wanna tell you I am <eos> So honey, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> And maybe we found love right where we are <eos> When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades <eos> And the crowds don't remember my name <eos> When my hands don't play the strings the same way <eos> I know you will still love me the same <eos> 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen <eos> And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory <eos> And I'm thinking 'bout how <eos> People fall in love in mysterious ways <eos> And maybe it's all part of a plan <eos> Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes <eos> Hoping that you'll understand <eos> That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> And maybe we found love right where we are <eos> So baby, now, take me into your loving arms <eos> Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars <eos> Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud <eos> That maybe we found love right where we are <eos> Oh baby, we found love right where we are <eos> And we found love right where we are <eos>

Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Aunque tú me has echado en el abandono <eos> Aunque tú has muerto mis ilusiones <eos> En vez de maldecirte con justo encono <eos> En mis sueños te colmo <eos> En mis sueños te colmo de bendiciones <eos> Sufro la inmensa pena de tu extravío <eos> Siento el dolor profundo de tu partida <eos> Y lloro sin que tú sepas que el llanto mío <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras <eos> Tiene lágrimas negras como mi vida <eos> Viendo el Guadalquivir <eos> Las gitanas lavan, los ninõs en la orilla <eos> Veindo los barcos pasar <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> En el Guadalquivir, mi gitana lavaba <eos> Pañuelo de blanco y oro <eos> Que yo te daba, que yo te daba <eos> Aqua del limenero, aqua del limenero <eos> Si te acaricio la cara <eos> Tienes que darme un beso <eos> Tú me quieres dejar <eos> Yo no quiero sufrir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos> Contigo me voy gitana <eos> Aunque me cueste morir <eos>

Yelling at the sky <eos> Screaming at the world <eos> Baby, why'd you go away? <eos> I’m still your girl <eos> Holding on too tight <eos> Head up in the clouds <eos> Heaven only knows where you are now <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait ’til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Never got the chance <eos> To say your last goodbye <eos> I gotta move on <eos> But it hurts to try <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I'm alright <eos> Baby, you're just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> How do I love, how do I love again? <eos> How do I trust, how do I trust again? <eos> I stay up all night, tell myself I’m alright <eos> Baby, you’re just harder to see than most <eos> I put the record on, wait 'til I hear our song <eos> Every night, I’m dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> Every night, I'm dancing with your ghost <eos> 
I'm taking out this time <eos> To give you a piece of my mind <eos> Who do you think you are? <eos> Maybe one day you'll be a star <eos> But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy <eos> 'Cause that's the way you make me feel <eos> I don't want no romance <eos> I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real <eos> I never said that I would be your everything <eos> But you know that I love you, baby <eos> And it's gonna be such a shame <eos> When you can start living with it <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Bright lights and big cities <eos> Don't go to my baby's head <eos> You know I love you, baby <eos> But you choose this life instead <eos> So just remember what cha momma told you <eos> Before she sent you on your way <eos> She told never ever be too clever <eos> To not see your own mistakes <eos> I'll be here waiting for you <eos> When you come off your trip <eos> And I guess I will always be the one <eos> To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> Fool's paradise, you better think twice <eos> It's not very nice <eos> I'll be here waiting for you <eos> When you come off your trip <eos> And I guess I will always be the one <eos> To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby <eos>

Honey, you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you <eos> Stay away too long and I can't do without you <eos> Every chance you get, you seem to hurt me more and more <eos> But each hurt makes my love stronger than before <eos> I know flowers grow through rain <eos> But how can love grow through pain <eos> Ain't that peculiar <eos> A peculiarity <eos> Ain't that peculiar, baby <eos> Peculiar as can be, oh <eos> You tell me lies that should be obvious to me <eos> But I'm so much in love with you baby 'til I don't want to see <eos> But that things you do and say are designed to make me blue <eos> It's a dog gone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true <eos> But if the truth makes love last longer <eos> Why do lies make my love stronger <eos> Ain't that peculiar, baby <eos> Peculiar as can be <eos> Ain't that peculiar <eos> A peculiarity, yeah yeah <eos> I cried so much just like a child that's lost his toy <eos> Maybe baby, you think these tears I cry are tears of joy <eos> A child can cry so much until you do everything they say <eos> But unlike a child, my tears don't help me to get my way <eos> I know love can last through years <eos> But how can love last through tears <eos> Ain't that peculiar, baby <eos> Peculiar as can be <eos> Ain't that peculiar, honey <eos> Peculiar as can be <eos> Said, "I don't understand it, baby" <eos> It's so strange sometimes <eos> Ain't that peculiar, darlin' <eos> Oh <eos>

Once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I wanna drink, wanna think, write a song about it <eos> I wanna smoke, make a joke, try to hide the damage <eos> I wanna drive this car right over the edge <eos> Of every bad idea, I didn't have yet <eos> I look at you, look at me, feeling kinda tragic <eos> Dazed and confused, hard to see, where we lost the magic <eos> I never meant to be hypocritical <eos> This fucking crazy ride's left me cynical <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime <eos> I try to run, try to hide, just forget about it <eos> I tell myself every night, I could live without it <eos> I wanna say goodbye to the loneliness <eos> But every time I do, I make another mess <eos> And just like that, I know there's no looking back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> And just like that, I know there's no turning back <eos> We already made this bed and I can't even sleep in it <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> Take it fast and kill me slow <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> 'Til I hit an all-time low <eos> Once in a lifetime, never the right time <eos> To throw out everything we had <eos> Try to forget you, gotta pretend to <eos> I hope a heart only breaks this bad <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime (I hope a heart only breaks this bad) <eos> Once in a lifetime, once in a lifetime <eos> 
I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> If you ask, just to show that I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> That it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> A return from unnatural vacation <eos> Left my mind and left my body vacant <eos> To remove from an old situation <eos> To where it is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> So wait in the last place you lost me <eos> I aim to change, play the rules <eos> That I've wanted to break <eos> But refuse any longer <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is what it is <eos> It is <eos> I'll keep my hands off the table <eos> Just for you, I could show you I'm able <eos> To lie and tell myself how a day goes <eos> And never forget <eos> Never forget <eos> Never <eos>

Paper bags and plastic hearts <eos> All are belongings in shopping carts <eos> It's goodbye <eos> But we got one more night <eos> Lets get drunk and ride around <eos> And make peace with an empty town <eos> We can make it right <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> Tonight will change our lives <eos> It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry <eos> We won't give up the fight <eos> We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs <eos> And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young <eos> And we'll feel so alive <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> And we won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> All of the wasted time <eos> The hours that were left behind me <eos> Answers that we'll never find <eos> They don't mean a thing tonight <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Throw it away <eos> Forget yesterday <eos> We'll make the great escape <eos> We won't hear a word they say <eos> They don't know us anyway <eos> Watch it burn <eos> Let it die <eos> 'Cause we are finally free tonight <eos> 
I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> I've been running from it <eos> Tired of running from it <eos> Scared of feeling something <eos> Now I'm stuck here tryna get up outta this hole <eos> I tried to be strong <eos> I tried to make it work but I've been feeling too numb <eos> Skies are beating on me <eos> Why'd you leave me lonely? <eos> Feeling Whitney, Stoney <eos> Now I'm stuck here wondering where I ever went wrong <eos> How could I be strong? <eos> I'm fighting for your love <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> I don't see light in your love anymore <eos> There ain't no reason to call in a fall <eos> I don't like feelings and feeling like running from something <eos> And feeling so out of control <eos> I know that the feelings are gone <eos> I'm spending too much time alone <eos> I'm hoping you pick up the phone <eos> And ring me when you wanna stay overnight <eos> My shoulder's right <eos> My baby's all that I want <eos> And I play them, all of my favourite songs <eos> That lady is my favourite one <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> Ain't never gonna let you go <eos> Got my heart NASCAR racing <eos> Shine ain't never fading <eos> He just left you hanging <eos> Fiending for your love <eos> All worth it for the waiting <eos> Give you what you need <eos> Take you where you want <eos> Can't feel it when we're all alone <eos> Know you're wanting something more <eos> My heart is like an open door <eos> Just ring me when you wanna go <eos> I'll wait till you're home <eos> Hold a place till you're coming home <eos> Show you where the garden grows <eos> Just ring me when you wanna go <eos> I can't wait for you to come my way <eos> I've been far away <eos> But I'll keep running <eos> Just to find a way to you till then <eos> 
If there was a single day I could live <eos> A single breath I could take <eos> I'd trade all the others away <eos> The blood's on the wall, so you might as well just admit it <eos> And bleach out the stains, commit to forgetting it <eos> You're better off empty and blank, than left with a single pathetic trace of this <eos> Smother another failure, lay this to rest <eos> Console yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck <eos> Absorb yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself <eos> I'll chain you to the truth, for the truth shall set you free <eos> I'll turn the screws of vengeance and bury you with honesty <eos> I'll make all your dreams come to life, then slay them as quickly as they came <eos> Smother another failure, lay this to rest <eos> Console yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself, see who gives a fuck <eos> Absorb yourself, you're better alone <eos> Destroy yourself <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> See who gives a fuck <eos> Failure! <eos> If there was a day I could live <eos> If there was a single breath I could take <eos> I'd trade all the others away <eos> I'd trade all the others away! <eos>

Hush now, child <eos> And don't you cry <eos> Your folks might understand you <eos> By and by <eos> Just move on up <eos> Toward your destination <eos> Though you may find, from time to time, complication <eos> Bite your lip <eos> And take a trip <eos> Though there may be wet road ahead <eos> And you cannot slip <eos> Just move on up <eos> For peace you'll find <eos> Into the steeple of beautiful people <eos> Where there's only one kind <eos> So hush now, child <eos> And don't you cry <eos> Your folks might understand you <eos> By and by <eos> Move on up <eos> And keep on wishin' <eos> Remember your dream is your only scheme <eos> So keep on pushin' <eos> Take nothing less <eos> Than the supreme best <eos> Do not obey rumors people say <eos> 'Cause you can pass the test <eos> Just move on up <eos> To a greater day <eos> With just a little faith <eos> If you put your mind to it, you can surely do it <eos> Just move on up <eos> Move on up <eos> But move on up <eos> Oh, child, but just a-move on up <eos> But move on up <eos> Move on up <eos> 
The awakened pulse of a blackened star <eos> The dawn of nightfall <eos> The bright unlight shine wide and far <eos> Enchant, enthrall, shatter my fears <eos> The broken glass of a thousand spheres <eos> Pierce the clouds to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> Death, as the fire within is released <eos> The infernal depths of eternity whispering beyond <eos> I hear the serpent’s whispering respond <eos> The strangler and the wide awake <eos> The vision and the twisting snake <eos> Connect the worlds to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> I call on thee, demon god with crimson scales adorned <eos> I call on thee of sacred blood, take my soul beyond <eos> Now answer me, serpent king, deity of the night <eos> Now answer me, fiery wing, save me from the light <eos> Hail the dead <eos> Hail the dark <eos> Hail the night <eos> Hail the silence <eos> The stormy winds of eternity <eos> Haunting life’s debris <eos> And fools set sails to flee the void on the raging sea <eos> Drag me down underneath, unchain my soul beneath <eos> Fill my lungs with your blood to still my awoken hunger <eos> Death, unchain the beast <eos> I call on thee, demon god with crimson scales adorned <eos> I call on thee of sacred blood, take my soul beyond <eos> Now answer me, serpent king, deity of the night <eos> Now answer me, fiery wing, save me from the light <eos> Hail the dead <eos> Hail the dark <eos> Hail the night <eos> Hail the silence <eos> 
Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Mi querida <eos> Madre mía, yo recuerdo <eos> Madre mía, tu cabello como cataratas <eos> Madre mía, tus labios colorados de un rojo sangriento <eos> Madre mía, tus tacones se anunciaban <eos> Madre mía, martillazos se escuchaban por los pasillos <eos> Madre mía, enfrentemos a los hechos <eos> Madre mía, el cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Yo recuerdo amenazas a cuchillo, riñas animales <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Yo no supe qué hacer <eos> Ante tus poderes descomunales <eos> Madre mía, yo he heredado tu abismo <eos> Madre mía, te perdono <eos> Fuiste más que suficiente <eos> Madre mía, madre mía <eos> Madre mía, mi querida <eos> Madre mía, no quedan palabras por decir <eos> Yo aprendí tu idioma <eos> Pero aún me rehuso a hablarlo <eos> Me duele en el alma <eos> Me duele todo de mí <eos> La distancia no fue sino mi única opción, mi única opción <eos> Yo me siento convertir en ti <eos> Madre mía, qué ironía <eos> Madre mía, qué alegría <eos> Yo he heredado tus abismos descomunales <eos> El cordón umbilical nunca se cortó <eos> Hasta que lo hice yo <eos> Madre mía, celestial <eos> Eres para siempre, para siempre <eos> Madre mía <eos> Mi origen y mi fin <eos>

I got my first real six string <eos> Bought it at the five and dime <eos> Played it til my fingers bled <eos> Was the summer of '69 <eos> Me and some guys from school <eos> Had a band and we tried real hard <eos> Jimmy quit and Jody got married <eos> I shoulda known we'd never get far <eos> But when I look back now <eos> That summer seemed to last forever <eos> And if I had the choice <eos> Ya, I'd always wanna be there <eos> Those were the best days of my life <eos> Ain't no use in complainin' <eos> When you got a job to do <eos> Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in <eos> And that's when I met you, ya <eos> Standin' on your mama's porch <eos> You told me that you'd wait forever <eos> Oh, and when you held my hand <eos> I knew that it was now or never <eos> Those were the best days of my life <eos> Oh Yeah! <eos> Back in the summer of '69 <eos> Oh! <eos> Man, we were killin' time <eos> We were young and restless <eos> We needed to unwind <eos> I guess nothin' can last forever <eos> Forever, no... <eos> Yeah! <eos> And now the times are changin' <eos> Look at everything that's come and gone <eos> Sometimes when I play that old six string <eos> I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong <eos> Standin' on your mama's porch <eos> You told me it would last forever <eos> Oh, the way you held my hand <eos> I knew that it was now or never <eos> Those were the best days of my life <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Back in the summer of '69 <eos> Uh-huh <eos> It was the summer of '69 <eos> Oh yeah <eos> Me and my baby in a 69 <eos> Oh! Oh! <eos> It was the summer, summer, summer of 69 <eos>

I've never been good at new beginnings <eos> Everything just falls apart <eos> Inside this hell that I'm living <eos> I'm screaming out to restart <eos> Sometimes, it's loudest in an empty room <eos> Sometimes, healing needs a garden to bloom <eos> Sometimes, the lesson isn't trust the few <eos> 'Cause you're the last one I've got to lose <eos> Sometimes, it's loudest in an empty room <eos> Sometimes, healing needs a garden bloom <eos> Sometimes, the lesson isn't trust the few <eos> 'Cause you're the last one I've got to lose <eos> 'Cause I'm unbound from you <eos> Sometimes, it's loudest in an empty room <eos> Sometimes, healing needs a garden to bloom <eos> Sometimes, the lesson isn't trust the few <eos> 'Cause you're the last one I've got to lose <eos> (You're the last one I've got to lose) <eos> I'm unbound <eos> I'm unbound <eos> 
Joy to the world! The Lord has come <eos> Let earth receive her King! <eos> Let every heart prepare him room <eos> And heaven and nature sing <eos> Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns <eos> Let men their songs employ <eos> While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains <eos> Repeat the sounding joy <eos> No more let sins and sorrows grow <eos> Nor thorns infest the ground <eos> He comes to make his blessings flow <eos> Far as the curse is found <eos> He rules the earth with truth and grace <eos> And makes the nations prove <eos> The glories of his righteousness <eos> And wonders of his love <eos>

I've been waiting for the tides to change <eos> For the waves to send you my way <eos> I see you darling but you pixelate <eos> It gets hard to take these days <eos> But we’ll hold the line, I won't let go <eos> 'Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home <eos> And I don't mind <eos> 'Cause we both know <eos> That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home <eos> Because when I'm in a room with you <eos> That missing piece is found <eos> You know when you're by my side, darling <eos> Nothing can bring us down <eos> I remembеr happy wasted days <eos> Summers golden hazе in our eyes <eos> Lifting you above the breaking waves <eos> Memories floating back to my mind <eos> You said hold the line, I won't let go <eos> Cause I'll be there when you can finally make it home <eos> And I don’t mind <eos> ’Cause we both know <eos> That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home <eos> Because when I’m in a room with you <eos> That missing piece is found <eos> You know when you're by my side, darling <eos> Nothing can bring us down <eos> It's like when you're far away from me <eos> I get lost in the crowd <eos> Because when I’m in a room with you <eos> That missing piece is found <eos> I won't waste a minute when you're here <eos> And we're finally in the clear <eos> When every day is like the last <eos> I just keeping holding fast <eos> Because when I'm in a room with you <eos> That missing piece is found <eos> You know when you're by my side, darling <eos> Nothing can bring us down <eos> It's like when you're far away from me <eos> I get lost in the crowd <eos> Because when I'm in a room with you <eos> That missing piece is found <eos> 
I saw three ships come sailing in <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> I saw three ships come sailing in <eos> On Christmas Day in the morning <eos> And what was in those ships all three <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day? <eos> And what was in those ships all three <eos> On Christmas Day in the morning? <eos> This piece of Earth that came to me <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> This peace on Earth that came to be <eos> On Christmas Day <eos> And all the bells on Earth shall ring <eos> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day <eos> And all the bells on Earth shall ring <eos> On Christmas Day <eos>

24 de Diciembre, va llegando navidad <eos> En casita con familia, le di un abrazo a mamá <eos> Un traguito que me sirva, algo fino tequila <eos> Los regalos no me importan, lo que quiero es disfrutar <eos> Sé que unos no tienen porque celebrar <eos> Este año muchos golpes les fue a dar <eos> Pero la frente en alto hay que tener <eos> Se vienen tiempos mejores, tiempos de bien <eos> Yo, yo, Merry Christmas <eos> De parte de la Fuerza Regida viejo <eos> Otro pedo! <eos> Los que no llegaron no se olvidan, ya están en un mejor lugar <eos> Desde arriba allá nos cuida, no nos quieren ver llorar <eos> Merry Christmas mis amigos, gritamos Feliz Navidad <eos> Para todos hay en casa un abrazo muy especial <eos> Otro trago amargo me voy a servir <eos> Hay muchas razones para estar feliz <eos> Todavía falta mucho por vivir <eos> Y muchas metas las que tengo que cumplir <eos>

"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick <eos> The one that makes me scream", she said <eos> "The one that makes me laugh", she said <eos> And threw her arms around my neck <eos> "Show me how you do it, and I promise you <eos> I promise that I'll run away with you <eos> I'll run away with you" <eos> Spinning on that dizzy edge <eos> Kissed her face and kissed her head <eos> Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow <eos> "Why are you so far away?", she said <eos> "Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you? <eos> That I'm in love with you?" <eos> You, soft and only <eos> You, lost and lonely <eos> You, strange as angels <eos> Dancing in the deepest oceans <eos> Twisting in the water <eos> You're just like a dream <eos> You're just like a dream <eos> Daylight licked me into shape <eos> I must have been asleep for days <eos> And moving lips to breathe her name <eos> I opened up my eyes <eos> And found myself alone, alone <eos> Alone above a raging sea <eos> That stole the only girl I loved <eos> And drowned her deep inside of me <eos> You, soft and only <eos> You, lost and lonely <eos> You, just like heaven <eos> 
Letra de "La Planta" <eos> Si tú piensas que me has roto la maceta <eos> No te preocupes <eos> Ya me acostumbre a regarla <eos> Y ya te me estabas pasando de verde <eos> Mañana te secas <eos> Yo me consigo otra planta <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> Así si la riego no <eos> No me preocupo <eos> Porque va estar muy bien <eos> Asi si la riego no <eos> Ya no me apuro <eos> Como la regue contigo <eos> Y que un sólo jardinero <eos> Recoja el fruto <eos> No como tu que ya estabas recogida <eos> Y si es que otro se anima <eos> Pues buena suerte <eos> A ver si no se espina <eos> Y te pareces tanto <eos> A una enredadera <eos> En cualquier tronco te atoras <eos> Y le das vueltas <eos> Con tus ramitas <eos> Que se enredan donde quiera <eos> Y entre tanto ramerio <eos> Ya te apodamos "la ramera" <eos> Y que un solo jardinero <eos> Recoja el fruto <eos> No como tu que ya estabas recogida <eos> Y si es que otro se anima <eos> Pues buena suerte <eos> A ver si no se espina <eos> Y te pareces tanto amor <eos> A una enredadera <eos> En cualquier tronco te atoras <eos> Y le das vueltas <eos> Con tus ramitas <eos> Que se enredan donde quiera <eos> Y entre tanto ramerio <eos> Ya te apodamos "la ramera" <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> Pero que sea desértica <eos> Oh si! Desértica <eos> ¡Qué Plantón! <eos> 
Lights are out in the street where I stand <eos> It sure would be great to have a clock with no hands <eos> Met a man said he was wise and in tune <eos> Lazy Sundays turn to Mondays to soon <eos> He said take my hand let us walk thru' that door <eos> I said I walk with my feet and I've been thru' it before <eos> The end is nigh son I said I suppose <eos> If it is we must be pretty damn close <eos> Ain't no stone unturned <eos> No wiseguy's gonna put me down <eos> Ain't no song unheard <eos> But it laughs back at you now <eos> And that might put you down <eos> With bloodshot eyes he was letting me know <eos> He said ten years from now I said a hundred ago <eos> Don't you leave now I know you will fail <eos> I said that's old news I'm sorry gotta bail <eos> Ain't no stone unturned <eos> No wiseguy's gonna put me down <eos> Ain't no song unheard <eos> But it laughs back at you now <eos> And that might put you down <eos> And that might put you down <eos> Lights are out in the street where I stand <eos> It sure would be great to have a clock with no hands <eos> Met a man said he was wise and in tune <eos> Lazy Sundays turn to Mondays to soon <eos> With bloodshot eyes he was letting me know <eos> He said ten years from now I said a hundred ago <eos> Don't you leave now I know you will fail <eos> I said that's old news I'm sorry gotta bail <eos> Ain't no stone unturned <eos> No wiseguy's gonna put me down <eos> Ain't no song unheard <eos> But it laughs back at you now <eos> Ain't no stone unturned <eos> No wiseguy's gonna put me down <eos> Ain' t no song unheard <eos> But it laughs back at you now <eos> Right back at you now <eos>

I drank a liter of tequila in my bedroom <eos> It's takin' every ounce of power not to text you <eos> Your body frozen in my mind like a statue <eos> Wish I could scratch off all the letters of our tattoo <eos> I'm a believer, but I keep learnin' the hard way <eos> That ya love's only gonna make my heart break <eos> While I was crying, you were flying at a party <eos> Baby, you play me, like Atari at an arcade <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't dеserve me <eos> I caught you lying with thе Bible in your right hand <eos> Thought you could rule me like I wasn't gonna bite back <eos> I'm sick of manipulative venomous spending all of my time <eos> Second-guessing my mind, keep on taking the high road <eos> But I'm ready to go low, so <eos> I'm usually nice, but just for tonight <eos> I wanna be mean, I wanna fight <eos> I wanna say things I've been keepin' inside <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> I was buried alive <eos> But I learned to hold my breath <eos> No, you won't fool me twice <eos> You can't have this back <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> Four letter words, I'm cursing <eos> Fuck you, you didn't deserve me <eos> 
Letra de Fuego <eos> Hola, me inspiras cuando caminas <eos> Con tu mirada me devoras <eos> Tú sabes que me fascinas <eos> De esquina a esquina <eos> De abajo a arriba <eos> Con tu sabor a latina <eos> Se siente que no pasan las horas <eos> Me sacas de la rutina <eos> Mi vida es mejor ahora <eos> Quédate hasta el amanecer <eos> Yo que he esperado tanto <eos> Apágame <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemo' al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Nena, me inspiras cuando caminas <eos> Me pierdo en tus caderas <eos> Eres la cosa más linda <eos> De esquina a esquina <eos> De abajo a arriba <eos> Con tu sabor a latina <eos> Se siente que no pasan las horas <eos> Me sacas de la rutina <eos> Mi vida es mejor ahora <eos> Quédate hasta el amanecer <eos> Yo que he esperado tanto <eos> Apágame <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemo' al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Fuego, fuego (tu sonrisa, fuego que me mata) <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo (tu aceleras este sentimiento) <eos> Fuego, fuego (ven baila conmigo esta noche) <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo (ay yo me quemo, me quemo, quemo) <eos> Este fuego, fuego <eos> Con tus labios me quemo, quemo <eos> Hasta las sabanas las prendemos <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> Quiero, quiero <eos> Que de la cama pasemos al cielo <eos> Y no te vayas porque me muero <eos> Mira lo bien que nos entendemos <eos> Cuando lo hacemos <eos> 
I can't, I can't, I can't stand the man <eos> I'm seeing in the mirror <eos> I try, I try to get my mind right <eos> But it never gets much clearer <eos> Maybe I should see somebody <eos> 'Cause I can't keep this up <eos> Everything inside my body <eos> Is telling me to stop <eos> All my friends, they left me for dead <eos> And I don't have a clue where I am <eos> I lost my keys now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> All my friends, they hate me again <eos> I get too drunk when I get depressed <eos> I lost my shit now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> I can't, I can't, I can't pay the rent <eos> 'Cause I wasted all my money <eos> I try, I try to laugh off my life <eos> But lately, it's not funny (Funny) <eos> Maybe I should see somebody <eos> 'Cause I can't keep this up <eos> Everything inside my body <eos> Is telling me to stop <eos> All my friends, they left me for dead <eos> And I don't have a clue where I am <eos> I lost my keys now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> All my friends, they hate me again <eos> I get too drunk when I get depressed <eos> I lost my shit now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> All my friends, they left me for dead <eos> And I don't have a clue where I am <eos> I lost my keys now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> All my friends, they hate me again <eos> I get too drunk when I get depressed <eos> I lost my shit now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> All my friends, they hate me again <eos> Lost my shit now all I got left <eos> Is ten missed calls and one last cigarette <eos> Maybe I should see somebody <eos> 'Cause I can't keep this up <eos> Everything inside my body <eos> Is telling me to stop <eos>

By the darkest river <eos> Beneath the leafless trees <eos> I think I'm drowning <eos> This dream is killing me <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> In the coldest winter <eos> Between the fading lights <eos> I feel I'm falling into a frozen sky <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> Past the blackest heaven <eos> Above the dying stars <eos> I watch me breaking into a million shards <eos> (Wake up, wake up, wake up) <eos> But through the hardest hour <eos> Below the cruelest sign <eos> I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> (Wake up, wake up) <eos> Wake up <eos> A depression fed by overload <eos> False perceptions, the weight of the world <eos> A universe in the palm of your hand <eos> The artifice of endless strands <eos> Distraction flows down an obsessive stream <eos> Rejection grows into oppressive screams <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> The regression of advancing modes <eos> And imperial corrosive nodes <eos> A prime directive to disconnect <eos> Reclaim yourself and resurrect <eos> Distraction flows down an obsessive stream <eos> Rejection grows into oppressive screams <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> There's too many choices <eos> And I hear their relentless voices <eos> But you've gotta run them out <eos> Return to now and shut it down <eos> Shut it down <eos> A depression fed by overload <eos> False perceptions, the weight of the world <eos> Because there's too many choices <eos> Gotta kill their relentless voices <eos> (Wake up, wake up) <eos> I know I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> The hardest hour, the cruelest sign <eos> I'm waking up from this wretched lie <eos> I fight it the same, don't waste this day <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Wake up, wake up, wake up <eos> Memento mori <eos> Memento mori <eos> 
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee <eos> We don't take no trips on LSD; <eos> We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street <eos> But, We love living right, and being free <eos> We don't make a party out of loving <eos> But we like holding hands and pitching woo; <eos> We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy <eos> Like the hippies out in San Francisco do <eos> And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee <eos> A place where even squares can have a ball; <eos> We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse <eos> White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear <eos> Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen; <eos> A football's still the roughest thing on campus <eos> And the kids here still respect the college dean <eos> And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee <eos> A place where even squares can have a ball; <eos> We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse <eos> White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all <eos> (In Muskogee Oklahoma USA) <eos>

Move one inch at a time <eos> Don't make shit rhyme <eos> Would it be easy to repeat the first line? <eos> My mind's not a well <eos> It won't run dry <eos> Just keep drinking water and you'll be alright <eos> This is paralysis with no time at all to let go <eos> Well don't call me by my full name <eos> And all this is temporary <eos> It feels much better to know that you won't feel a thing <eos> Well don't talk about it; <eos> Write it down but don't ask for help <eos> I can't be honest with even myself <eos> Did you ever wish you were somebody else? <eos> Accomplishments are transient <eos> They pulled me in unremittingly <eos> Just lasting this long <eos> I feel relieved to let repetition save me <eos> Well don't call me by my full name <eos> And all this is temporary <eos> It feels much better to know that you won't feel a thing <eos> Well don't talk about it; <eos> Write it down but don't ask for help <eos> I can't be honest with even myself <eos> Did you ever wish you were somebody else? <eos> Move one inch at a time <eos> You'll be just fine <eos> Move one inch at a time <eos> You'll find... <eos> They pulled me in but accomplishments are transient <eos> They pulled me in but accomplishments are transient <eos> Well don't call me by my full name <eos> And all this is temporary <eos> It feels much better to know that you won't feel a thing <eos> Well don't talk about it; <eos> Write it down but don't ask for help <eos> I can't be honest with even myself <eos> Did you ever wish you were... <eos> Did you ever wish you were... <eos> Did you ever wish you were somebody else? <eos>

Not like I think about it night after night <eos> Your name is echoing inside of my mind <eos> Then I got to know you <eos> Oh, false hopes rule <eos> And then I opened <eos> Right up to you <eos> This stupid act, that things aren't bad <eos> We could never be like that <eos> Live far away now, that's no joke <eos> No way to reach you when I'm low <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> I do remember everything that you said <eos> Won't let that pointless talk stay trapped in my head <eos> Then I got to know you <eos> Oh, false hopes rule <eos> Those days are gone now <eos> You left too soon <eos> This stupid act, that things aren't bad <eos> We could never be like that <eos> Live far away now, that's no joke <eos> No way to reach you when I'm low <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> Everything you said <eos> Makes sense to me right now <eos> You were just straight scared <eos> Afraid that it might work out <eos> Everything you said <eos> Makes sense to me right now <eos> You were just straight scared <eos> Afraid that it might work out <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> Lying around, daydreaming <eos> Wanting you now, but that's wishful thinking <eos> Everything you said (You said) <eos> Makes sense to me right now (Right now) <eos> You were just straight scared (Straight scared) <eos> Afraid that it might work out (Work out) <eos> Everything you said (You said) <eos> Makes sense to me right now (Right now) <eos> You were just straight scared (Straight scared) <eos> Afraid that it might work out <eos> (Afraid that it might work out) <eos> 
You say I spend too much time <eos> In my head and it holds me back <eos> I think you spend too much time <eos> Givin' me second chances that <eos> I don't deserve <eos> And it hurts <eos> You give me the kinda love that I never had <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that, mmm <eos> Wish that I could love like <eos> You, that weekend, we were sleeping <eos> In that London hotel room <eos> Heard you singing in the shower <eos> Damn near broke my heart in two <eos> And I don't deserve you <eos> And it hurts to <eos> Get the kinda love that you never had <eos> Wish that you could give, give, give it back <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> Ah-ooh, wish that I could love like that <eos> But look at us, we're in a room half-crowded <eos> And I wish that I could finish what we started <eos> But I don't know how <eos> To give the kinda love that you deserve <eos> Knowing that I can't just makes it worse <eos> Wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You give me your unconditional <eos> Don't mean to sound so typical <eos> But I wish that I could love, love, love you back <eos> Wish that I could love like that <eos> You are perfect <eos> Wish that I could <eos> You are perfect <eos> Wish that I could <eos> 
I’ve feared the deepest darkest secrets that live inside of me <eos> Defeat and tragedy, walking in shame, finding nowhere to hide <eos> I’ve thrown my bottles of guilt into the sea <eos> Hoping the waves carry them away from me <eos> Oh <eos> My heart is beating. I’ll never stop fighting. I’ll keep breathing <eos> My heart is beating. I’ll never stop fighting. I’ll keep breathing to stay alive <eos> And here I go, off to make a change <eos> I’m screaming, screaming revival <eos> All of my strength, all of my might <eos> Will go into this to take back my life <eos> All of my strength, all of my might <eos> Will go back into this to take back my life <eos> My life, my life, my life <eos> I’m taking back my life <eos> My life, my life, my life, taking back my life <eos> Let’s go.... <eos> This song is music to my ears <eos> This song is music <eos> And is a new production on an old stage <eos> On an old stage <eos> I won’t dwell in unhappiness <eos> I will not dwell in <eos> Grasping humility, asking forgiveness <eos> Tomorrow is gone, I’ll start living for today <eos> I’ll never stop the fighting and I’ll take it all away <eos> Tomorrow is gone, I’ll start living for today <eos> I’ll never stop the fighting and I’ll take it away <eos> 
Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair <eos> With the roses so red and the lilies so fair <eos> And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew <eos> The pale amanita and eyes look like blue <eos> I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay <eos> I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway <eos> When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay <eos> All portion of love had all flown away <eos> Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love <eos> And to cherish me over all others above <eos> How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell <eos> He's left me no warning, no words of farewell <eos> Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower <eos> That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour <eos> Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour <eos> He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower <eos>

She is something to behold <eos> Elegant and bold <eos> She is electricity <eos> Running to my soul <eos> And I could easily lose my mind <eos> The way you kiss me will work each time <eos> Calling me to come back to bed <eos> Singing "Georgia On My Mind" <eos> And I <eos> And I <eos> Lips generous and warm <eos> You build me up like stairs <eos> Eyes innocent and wild <eos> Remind me what it's like <eos> And I could easily lose my mind <eos> The way you kiss me will work each time <eos> Pulling me back into the flames <eos> And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up <eos> And I, I never understood what was at stake <eos> I never thought your love was worth its weight <eos> Well, now you've come and gone <eos> I've finally worked it out, I worked it out <eos> I never should have told you <eos> I never should have let you see inside <eos> Don't want it troubling your mind <eos> Won't you let it be? <eos> I never should have told you <eos> I never should have let you see inside <eos> Don't want it troubling your mind <eos> Won't you let it be? <eos> I never should have told you <eos> I never should have let you see inside <eos> Don't want it troubling your mind <eos> Won't you let it be? <eos> I never should have told you <eos> I never should have let you see inside <eos> Don't want it troubling your mind <eos> Won't you let it be? <eos> And I could easily lose my mind <eos> The way you kiss me will work each time <eos> Pulling me back into the flames <eos> And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up <eos> And I, I never understood what was at stake <eos> I never thought your love was worth its weight <eos> Well, now you've come and gone <eos> I've finally worked it out, I worked it out <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> Ooh <eos> Oh, oh, oh, oh <eos> 
Pulled into your driveway <eos> An hour ago <eos> Sit in front of my place <eos> Saying I don’t wanna be alone <eos> I really think I like you <eos> But I don’t understand <eos> Most of the things that I do <eos> I’m so sorry man <eos> I need Dramamine when I’m with you <eos> Cause you move faster than my trust issues <eos> Now I’ll bite my tongue <eos> And I’m scared that <eos> I’ll say something dumb <eos> I can’t take back <eos> What is it about me <eos> That makes me so mean <eos> But tell me why I miss you <eos> Whenever I’m with you <eos> Every night I can’t sleep <eos> Unless you’re next to me <eos> There’s just something about you <eos> That makes me doubt you <eos> Took you to meet my parents <eos> I said here’s my friеnd <eos> When we talk I’m oversharing <eos> Plеase cut me off again <eos> I don’t want life to pass me by <eos> I’m just trying to understand <eos> I think I’m done overthinking it <eos> I’m so sorry man <eos> I need Dramamine when I’m with you <eos> Cause you move faster than my trust issues <eos> Now I’ll bite my tongue <eos> And I’m scared that <eos> I’ll say something dumb <eos> I can’t take back <eos> What is it about me <eos> That makes me so mean <eos> But tell me why I miss you <eos> Whenever I’m with you <eos> Every night I can’t sleep <eos> Unless you’re next to me <eos> There’s just something about you <eos> That makes me doubt you <eos> 
I've never been one to ask for help <eos> If I need a mountain moved, I move it myself <eos> I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday <eos> Quote you the scripture kind <eos> I'm far from a preacher <eos> But I'm a believer <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> For someone to love me like you do <eos> Graceful eyes to see me through <eos> A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me <eos> A touch that kills me too <eos> And baby, you're perfect, I guess the good Lord heard it <eos> 'Cause every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed <eos> On the highway to hell, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> Every single day, before I knew your name <eos> I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you <eos> Every tail light fade in the goodbye rain <eos> Girl, even today, I prayed for you <eos> I kept my faith like that old King James <eos> Said I'm supposed to <eos> It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom <eos> I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> I prayed for you <eos> 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And never brought to mind? <eos> Should auld acquaintance be forgot <eos> And days auld lang syne? <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll drink a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> Where we, too, have run about the braes <eos> And pulled the gowans fine <eos> But we've wandered many a weary foot <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We, too, have pedaled in the burn <eos> From morning sun 'till dine <eos> But seas between us braid have roared <eos> Since auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> And there's a hand, my trusty fiere <eos> And he's a hand o' thine <eos> And we'll take a right gude-willy waught <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For auld lang- one more time! <eos> For auld lang syne, my dear <eos> For auld lang syne <eos> We'll take a cup of kindness yet <eos> For <eos> (Auld lang) <eos> Lang syne <eos> 
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you <eos> Or tell you that <eos> But if I didn't say it, well, I'd still have felt it <eos> Where's the sense in that? <eos> I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder <eos> Or return to where we were <eos> But I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrender <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> I know I left too much mess and <eos> Destruction to come back again <eos> And I caused nothing but trouble <eos> I understand if you can't talk to me again <eos> And if you live by the rules of "it's over" <eos> Then I'm surе that that makes sense <eos> But I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrеnder <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> And when we meet <eos> Which I'm sure we will <eos> All that was there <eos> Will be there still <eos> I'll let it pass <eos> And hold my tongue <eos> And you will think <eos> That I've moved on <eos> I will go down with this ship <eos> And I won't put my hands up and surrender <eos> There will be no white flag above my door <eos> I'm in love and always will be <eos> 
Oh, yeah <eos> Alright <eos> Somebody's Heine is crowding my icebox <eos> Somebody's cold one is giving me chills <eos> Guess I'll just close my eyes <eos> Oh, yeah <eos> Alright <eos> Feels good <eos> Inside <eos> Flip on the telly, wrestle with Jimmy <eos> Somethin' is bubblin' behind my back <eos> The bottle is ready to blow <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> Your drug is a heartbreaker <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> My love is a life taker <eos> I can't confront you, I never could do <eos> That which might hurt you, so try and be cool <eos> When I say, "this way is a water slide away from me <eos> That takes you further every day," so be cool <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> Your drug is a heartbreaker <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> My love is a life taker <eos> Dear daddy, I write you, in spite of years of silence <eos> You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good, or so I hear <eos> This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings <eos> Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the flood <eos> Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> Your drug is a heartbreaker <eos> Say it ain't so <eos> My love is a life taker <eos> 
He came from somewhere back in her long ago <eos> The sentimental fool don't see <eos> Tryin' hard to recreate <eos> What had yet to be created once in her life <eos> She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale <eos> Never coming near what he wanted to say <eos> Only to realize it never really was <eos> She had a place in his life <eos> He never made her think twice <eos> As he rises to her apology <eos> Anybody else would surely know <eos> He's watching her go <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos> Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago <eos> Where he can still believe there's a place in her life <eos> Someday, somewhere <eos> She will return <eos> She had a place in his life <eos> He never made her think twice <eos> As he rises to her apology <eos> Anybody else would surely know <eos> He's watching her go <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos> But what a fool believes, he sees <eos> No wise man has the power to reason away <eos> What seems to be <eos> Is always better than nothing <eos> Than nothing at all <eos> 
You've heard it all, I’ve whispered to my mother next to you <eos> Wanting to be folded in grey and blue <eos> I'll eat the East River before it eats me <eos> But it'll take me before I get the chance to, dig in my teeth <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> You've heard it all I've whispered to my mother next to you <eos> I hate the Hudson River, I'm loyal to you <eos> I’ll eat the scuba divers if they eat me <eos> But they’ll take me before I get the chance to, swallow them whole <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> ’Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I’m not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not around here, I'm just so sore <eos> I'm not afraid to see the bottom <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> I'm not afraid, I know you're on it <eos> 'Cause I will, and I will <eos> 
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom <eos> Well, who am I to keep you down? <eos> It's only right that you should play the way you feel it <eos> But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness <eos> Like a heartbeat drives you mad <eos> In the stillness of remembering what you had <eos> And what you lost <eos> And what you had <eos> And what you lost <eos> Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Say, women, they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know <eos> You'll know <eos> Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions <eos> I keep my visions to myself <eos> It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams <eos> And have you any dreams you'd like to sell? <eos> Dreams of loneliness <eos> Like a heartbeat drives you mad <eos> In the stillness of remembering what you had <eos> And what you lost <eos> And what you had <eos> Oh, what you lost <eos> Thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Women, they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know <eos> Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining <eos> Players only love you when they're playing <eos> Say, women, they will come and they will go <eos> When the rain washes you clean, you'll know <eos> You'll know <eos> You will know <eos> Oh, you'll know <eos>

This night is cold in the kingdom <eos> I can feel you fade away <eos> From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and <eos> Your steps keep me awake <eos> Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste <eos> I once was a man with dignity and grace <eos> Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace <eos> So please, please <eos> Could you find a way to let me down slowly? <eos> A little sympathy, I hope you can show me <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, let me down <eos> Down, let me down, down <eos> Let me down <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile <eos> As I'm walking down the corridor <eos> And I know we haven't talked in a while <eos> So I'm looking for an open door <eos> Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste <eos> I once was a man with dignity and grace <eos> Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace <eos> So please, please <eos> Could you find a way to let me down slowly? <eos> A little sympathy, I hope you can show me <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, let me down <eos> Down, let me down, down <eos> Let me down <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> And I can't stop myself from falling down <eos> And I can't stop myself from falling down <eos> And I can't stop myself from falling down <eos> And I can't stop myself from falling down <eos> Could you find a way to let me down slowly? <eos> A little sympathy, I hope you can show me <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, down <eos> Let me down, let me down <eos> Down, let me down, down <eos> Let me down <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos> If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely <eos> If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly <eos>

Would you believe me, the things that I say? <eos> I'm tired, I'm gone, I'm lost without you <eos> You don't see through me, you can't run away <eos> I'm changing, deranging <eos> The darkness replacing composure <eos> It burns my eyes as I watch the flame die <eos> I will be satisfied when I get to the finish line <eos> And take back all that's mine <eos> The fire in me hasn't died <eos> Always trying to put it out <eos> You made it so bright, now you're blind <eos> So easy to see you and me today <eos> A searchlight, we're alright, we're fine without this <eos> Self loathing fear now that stands in our way <eos> I'm fading, degrading <eos> The darkness replacing composure <eos> It burns my eyes as I watch the flame die <eos> I will be satisfied when I get to the finish line <eos> And take back all that's mine <eos> The fire in me hasn't died <eos> Always trying to put it out <eos> You made it so bright, now you're blind <eos> My fire burns for the broken ones, the unspoken ones <eos> My fire burns down the battered walls and the bleeding halls <eos> We find our way to climb <eos> Over the barricades and the masquerades <eos> We light our fire and burn, burn <eos> I will be satisfied when I get to the finish line <eos> And take back all that's mine <eos> The fire in me hasn't died <eos> I will be satisfied when I get to the finish line <eos> And take back all that's mine <eos> The fire in me hasn't died <eos> Always trying to put it out <eos> You made it so bright, now you're blind <eos> Now you're blind <eos> Blind, blind <eos> Blind, blind <eos> Blind, blind <eos>
