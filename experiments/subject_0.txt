[REAL] It's all about the he says/she says bullshit / I think you better quit talkin' that shit / Punk, so come and --> get it / I feel like shit / My suggestion is to keep your distance
[REAL] Trusted friend, a life unchained, forgiveness for mistakes we've made / Lookin' for the answers from here to California / --> Picking wild flowers off on the side of the road / The further I go, the more I wanna get closer / I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
[GEN] I don't wanna be your friend, I wanna kiss your lips / I wanna kiss you until I lose my breath / I don't --> Oh, Hannah, I wanna feel you close / Oh, Hannah, come lie with my bones / Oh, Hannah, don't look away
[GEN] Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger / Don't you fight it 'til you tried it, do that conga beat / Feel the fire of desire --> Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga / I know you can't control yourself any longer / Come on, shake your body, baby, do the conga
[GEN] Don't care where you go / Some other man, some other man / --> I'm going down south, I'm going down south / Going down south, I'm going down south / Chilly wind don't blow
[REAL] What you tried to say to me / And how you suffered for your sanity / And how you tried to set them free --> / They would not listen, they did not know how / Perhaps they'll listen now
