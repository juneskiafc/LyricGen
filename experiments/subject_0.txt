[REAL] Well, your mama kept you, but your daddy left you / And I shoulda done you just the same / But I came to --> love you, am I born to bleed? / Any old time you keep me waitin' / Waitin', waitin'
[GEN] And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you / And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe / And it kills --> I'm in my bed / And you're not here / And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
[REAL]  --> 
[GEN] And I'm still here wishin' you were herе / And I'm still here wishin' you werе here / And I'm still here wishin' you were --> Late at night / When you're out doing your thing do I cross your mind / Am I still someone you need when you close your eyes
[REAL] If we were vampires and death was a joke / We'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke / Laugh at --> all the lovers and their plans / I wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand / Maybe time running out is a gift
[GEN] Ando viendo el techo, recordándote / Y a Dio' pidiendo que esté cuidándote / No soy bueno fingiendo que --> Yeah, yeah / Primero, quiero decirte que te amé cada segundo / Nunca te fallé (Fallé), con decirte esto, mami, ya yo cumplo
