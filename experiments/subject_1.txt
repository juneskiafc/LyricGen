[GEN] Let it snow, let it snow / Let it snow / --> Oh, the weather outside is frightful / But the fire is so delightful / Since we've no place to go
[GEN] I miss you more when I’m tryin’ not to / Yeah I’m tryin’ not to / I don’t want --> Is it just me? / Or did we / Do this this the last time we said it’s the last time
[REAL] I'll be yours and you'll be... / Lay with me, I'll lay with you / We'll do the things that --> lovers do / Put the stars in our eyes / And with heart shaped bruises
[REAL] Long lay the world in sin and error pining / 'Til He appears and the soul felt its worth / A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices --> / For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn / Fall on your knees; O hear the Angel voices!
[REAL] She is lying yet / That is meaningless and --> decay / Lying and slight sway "Huge moth" / 
[GEN] Trees lined up like dominoes / This old car could find its own way home / It's the ordinary --> They didn't ever say where we were going / We just climbed into the backseat / Eyes wide open to the picture show outside
