[GEN] When you get drunk, I'll be the wine / I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you / When you breathe I want to be the air for you, --> I guess this time you're really leavin' / I heard your suitcase say goodbye / Well as my broken heart lies bleedin'
[GEN] And give me the steel / To say; "Now this is how it's gonna be" / 'Cus baby, --> One day, we'll meet trouble halfway / And we'll say; "Oh why'd you gotta be that way?" / Trouble look around you
[REAL] Je suis fatigué, je suis épuisé / De faire semblant d'être heureux quand ils sont là / Je bois toutes les nuits mais tous les whiskys, pour moi, ont le même --> goût / Et tous les bateaux portent ton drapeau / Je ne sais plus où aller, tu es partout
[REAL] But I ain't trippin', no-oh / So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars all night long / Went to every bar, --> underneath the stars, one by one / You told me to grow up, but I can't just help myself / Maybe I'm messed up and maybe I need some help
[GEN] And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets / Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed / I know every curve like --> Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair / First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair / Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
[REAL] Watch out for those who want to be / Anything at all / And I hate --> / Everything you’re saying / Anxiety
