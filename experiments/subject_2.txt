[REAL] It's better off this way / Every time I think that I can get you out my head / --> You never ever let me forget 'cause / Just when I think you're gone, hear our song on the radio / Just like that, takes me back to the places we used to go
[REAL] J'prie pour mes ennemis / On détaille la mort pour embellir nos vies / Ils --> veulent mon wari / Ils veulent ma peau / On viendra chez eux comme la Gestapo
[GEN] All over LA then / Why don’t you stay? / Why --> Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah / Rooftop dripping, thundering, yeah / Bless my soul 'n' my skin, mhm
[GEN] And forever be in mine / But I don't think that's the truth / And I don't like being used and --> I've been sitting here staring at the clock on the wall / And I've been laying here praying, praying she won't call / It's just another call from home
[GEN] Willy and the Poor Boys are playin' / Bring a nickel; tap your feet / Down on the corner, --> Early in the evenin', just about supper time / Over by the courthouse they're starting to unwind / Four kids on the corner trying to bring you up
[REAL] Where's that higher love I keep thinking of? / Bring me a higher love / --> Bring me a higher love, oh / Bring me a higher love / A good kind of love, want a higher love
