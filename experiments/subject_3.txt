[REAL] Own a little piece of land / Watch the way things grow / And I, I could even follow you --> there / I could keep the fire lit / Forget what I used to know
[GEN] Gusto de gastarme en este gusto / Que me levanta de mis ruinas y me rearma / Gusto que me lleva a la puerta --> No se me quita el gusto de besarte / Ni se me borra el gusto de abrazarte / Ni se me aleja el gusto de quererte
[REAL] Where people will share / A world where people care / Someday at Christmas --> / They'll be no tears / All men are equal
[GEN] You're my downfall, you're my muse / My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues / I can't stop singing, it's --> What would I do without your smart mouth? / Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out / You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
[GEN] Mother Mary over over me / We notice / We understand --> Like Elvis, like everyone / We all die, we all live on in photos / And paperbacks, if we're lucky
[REAL] No more loneliness, only happiness / Love's gonna live here again / I hear bells --> a-ringin', I hear birds a-singin' / Love's gonna live here again / I hear bee's a-hummin, and I know the days' a-comin'
