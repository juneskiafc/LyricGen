[GEN] Its fucking inru- fuck it say it! / Nobody knows the hooves / Nobody knows what the grooves are --> Nobody Knows / Everybody wants to know the man, the Hooves / But they don't know what to do
[REAL] In your eyes I get lost / I get washed away / Just --> as long as I'm here in your arms / I could be in no better place / (Chorus : )
[REAL] Wake up, there's a new kid in the town / Honey, he's moving into the big house / --> Remember when I was so very hopeless / Darling, he's gonna make it all better / Oh mama
[GEN] When the rain start falling, boatman calling / Shake ‘em on down / The flood receding, the mountain appears --> Ain’t no doubt Jesus sees us / Acting foolishly on American Band Stand / Agog with spastic baskets, the latest fashions
[REAL] And that ain't gonna change / You know the only way / Stop --> loving her today / Today / Ears, don't even listen
[GEN] Jingle bells, jingle bells / (Ooh, yeah) / Jingle all the --> Mmm... / Jingle, jingle, yeah / It's a Christmas song
