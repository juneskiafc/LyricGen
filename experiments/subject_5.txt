[GEN] Að þú græðir mig / Minnst þú, mildingur, mín / Mest þurfum þín --> Heyr, himna smiður / Hvers skáldið biður / Komi mjúk til mín
[REAL] I've got love, love if you need it / I've got love that won't ever stop / I've got love, love if --> you need it / Dance with me / Music's so hypnotizing
[GEN] Pour a little heaven on me / So I can keep smiling / Another breath, --> I’m staring at a blank page / The words I cannot find / A chapter is unwritten
[REAL] I peeked behind the curtain / Now that magic rush / Feels like a trick that isn't workin' --> / But I haven't lost all hope yet / Yeah, it's hurtin', but it ain't dead
[GEN] Life's a never-ending wheel, say / Holy Diver / You're the star of the masquerade --> Mhhh-hm-hmm / Yeah, yeah / Holy Diver
[REAL] And as she walked up to the blackboard / I can still recall the words she had to say / She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA --> / Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there / And seven times he asked me for a date
