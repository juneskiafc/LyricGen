[REAL] Next year all our troubles / Will be miles away / Once again as in olden days --> / Happy golden days of yore / Faithful friends who are dear to us
[REAL] Master piece of a painting, yeah so far drawn / Chorus: / I'm feelin, I'm feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin', I'm feelin' gone in this bitch --> (x3) / We feelin' gone in this bitch, yeah talk to em kid / Verse 2 (Kid Katastrophe):
[GEN] So kiss me where I lay down / My hands pressed to your cheeks / A long --> I got a heart and I got a soul / Believe me, I will use them both / We made a start, be it a false one I know
[REAL] Only existed in my prayers / Until I saw her face / I knew --> I'd found the place / Where I could keep my every faith eternally cause / She got it all
[GEN] Climb mountains / Dance like nobody's watching / Live life like we never did --> I got a feelin' deep within my soul / And right now I really need to let to you know / That each time I've fallen down inside that hole
[GEN] Tell the truth / Sweet home Alabama / --> One, two, three / Turn it up / Big wheels keep on turnin'
