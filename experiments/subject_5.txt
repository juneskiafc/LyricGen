[GEN] Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus / Underneath his beard so snowy white / Oh, what --> I saw Mommy kissin' Santa Claus / Underneath the mistletoe last night / She didn't see me creep
[GEN] Watch out for those who want to be / Anything at all / And I hate --> And I hate / Everything you’re saying / Anxiety
[GEN] Put me back together or separate the skin from bone / Leave me all the pieces, then you can leave me alone / Tell me the reality is better than --> I push my fingers into my eyes / It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache / But it's made of all the things I have to take
[REAL] Life's mystery seems so faded / I can go where no one else can go / I know --> what no one else knows / Here I am, just drowning in the rain / With a ticket for a runaway train
[REAL] When the rain start falling, boatman calling / Shake ‘em on down / The flood receding, the mountain appears --> / Send out the black bird, send out the dove. / You Babel rabble-rousers
[REAL] Neighbors came by and talked on the porch / We all said goodnight and never locked the front door / --> Even downtown you could still see the stars / When the world turned slower, and you could smoke in a bar / My, oh my, how times have changed
