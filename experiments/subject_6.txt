[REAL] You're still the girl in the club / When I held your hair up, 'cause you had too much / And I need you to know that we're --> / Fallin' so fast, we're fallin' like the stars, fallin' in love / And I'm not scared to say those words
[REAL] So I could sell my soul to rock and roll / For just a minute and a moment, before all the roar / Pride beside me here to --> ignite me when I'm finding that I'm all alone / With prayer crossed paths, {?] but yeah you've been here before / Go baby, sell your soul to rock and roll
[GEN] Qui se penchent / Sur les petits matins / --> Ã” la belle vie / Sans amour / Sans soucis
[GEN] 'Cause you've always been mine / You've always been mine / You've always been --> Wouldn't you know / Those brown eyes / See a side of me
[GEN] Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah / The moon is rising, a revolution / I close my eyes, --> The night has fallen down the staircase / And I, for one, have felt its bruises / Equilbrium, inebriated
[REAL] Devil woman, let me be / And leave me alone / I want to --> go home / Devil woman you're evil / Like the dark coral reef
