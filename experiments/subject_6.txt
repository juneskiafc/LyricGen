[GEN] No, you can't stop them (God bless ya) / They're coming to get you / --> Too many slaves in this world / Die by torture and pain / Too many people do not see
[GEN] You called me strong, you called me weak / But still your secrets, I will keep / You took for granted all the times, I never --> Well, I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind / I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time / But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
[REAL] The way you think, the way you speak. We all end up here / What you think is what you preach. And what you think is what you preach / What you think is what you --> preach. And what you think is what you preach / What you think is what you preach. And what you think is what you preach / What you think is what you preach. Fuck that shit!
[REAL] I can't understand / Chorus: / Praise You God of Earth and --> sky / How beautiful is Your unfailing love / Unfailing love
[GEN] All over LA then / Why donâ€™t you stay? / Why --> Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah / Rooftop dripping, thundering, yeah / Bless my soul 'n' my skin, mhm
[REAL] And he rounds up the cattle each fall / Singing his cattle call / For hours --> he would ride / On the range far and wide / When the night wind blows up and slow
