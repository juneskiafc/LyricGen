[REAL] I'll be gone before my deliverance / Preach what you like / 'Cause I don't mind --> being lonely / So leave me alone / You're acting all holy
[GEN] It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker / Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old / Ain’t gon’ keep me 'round no ho shit, --> It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker (BIA, BIA) / It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker / Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old
[REAL] Hidin' somewhere in the night / Workin' hard to get my fill / Everybody wants --> a thrill / Payin' anything to roll the dice just one more time / Some will win, some will lose
[REAL] Me gusta lo que no tengo y quiero lo que no doy / No me compren no a mi mismo / No se entregarte la vida --> tampoco vivir sin vos / Yo se que de nada sirve / Mi amor
[GEN] Her spirits still lives / By the shores of the bay / --> She's comin for you / Hear the chains rattle / Turn you into a slave
[GEN] And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee / A place where even squares can have a ball; / We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse --> We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee / We don't take no trips on LSD; / We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
