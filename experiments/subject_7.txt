[REAL] Pasarán más de mil años / Muchos más / Puedo hacer que --> tenga amor la inmensidad / Pero allá tal como aquí / En la boca llevarás
[REAL] 'Cuz you're the only thing that makes it better / Lets get alone together / 'Cuz --> you're the only thing that makes it better / Lets get alone together / (alone together, yea, alone together)
[REAL] Really just to get my head straight / So I saw the world 'til I went broke / And tried to not --> look at my phone / Heard from my mom, you called her and dad to ask / How I've been
[GEN] I'm trying not to waste my time / If you want it, oh / You --> Daylight / I wake up feeling like you won't play right / I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
[GEN] So, let that wonder take you into space / And lay you under its loving embrace / Just --> There's a reason for the sun-shining sky / And there's a reason why I'm feeling so high / Must be the season when that
[GEN] I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you something / Damn / I like me --> To be young and in love in New York City / To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me / To be drunk and in love in New York City
