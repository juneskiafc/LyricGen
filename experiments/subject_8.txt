[GEN] I'll only hurt you if you let me / Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back) / And I'll call you when the party's over --> Don't you know I'm no good for you? / I've learned to lose you, can't afford to / Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
[REAL] It's a whole lotta money in this motherfucker / Ain't gon' keep me 'round no broke shit, that broke shit get old / Ain’t gon’ keep me 'round no ho shit, --> these hoes get too bold / I'm allergic to that no shit, my wrist game on cold / I might paint my coupe white just to match with my toes
[REAL] Two, something's got to give / Three, something's got to give / Now! --> / Let the bodies hit the floor / Let the bodies hit the floor
